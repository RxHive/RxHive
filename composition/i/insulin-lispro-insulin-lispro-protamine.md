# Insulin Lispro + Insulin Lispro Protamine

**Generic Name:** Insulin lispro protamine suspension and insulin lispro injection

**Usage:**

* **Treatment of diabetes mellitus:**  This combination product is used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with type 1 diabetes and in adults with type 2 diabetes. It's often prescribed when patients need both rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin. The lispro component provides quick blood sugar control, while the protamine-suspended lispro provides a longer-lasting effect.  It's typically administered once or twice daily, depending on individual needs and prescribed regimen.  Dosage is carefully determined by a doctor based on blood glucose monitoring.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and potentially serious side effect. Symptoms can include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, hunger, and rapid heartbeat. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:**  These can include redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:** Insulin can cause weight gain in some individuals.
* **Edema (swelling):** Fluid retention can occur.
* **Lipohypertrophy (fat buildup):**  This can occur at the injection site with repeated injections in the same location.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.  Symptoms can range from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):** This can occur if the dose is too low or if the patient is not following their prescribed treatment plan.
* **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA):** This is a serious complication that can occur in people with type 1 diabetes if blood sugar levels are not well-controlled.
* **Hypokalemia (low potassium levels):** This is a potential side effect, particularly with high doses of insulin.


**How it Works:**

This combination insulin product contains two forms of insulin lispro:

* **Insulin lispro injection (rapid-acting):** This starts working quickly (within 15-30 minutes) and has a relatively short duration of action (3-5 hours). It mimics the body's natural rapid insulin release after a meal.
* **Insulin lispro protamine suspension (intermediate-acting):** This component is designed to provide a longer-lasting effect (approximately 12-18 hours).  The protamine prolongs the action of the lispro.

Together, these two components provide both rapid and sustained control of blood glucose levels. The precise ratio of rapid-acting to intermediate-acting insulin in the pre-mixed formulation is carefully determined to meet individual patient needs.


**FAQs:**

* **How is it administered?** It's administered via subcutaneous injection (under the skin) using an insulin syringe or an insulin pen.  Never administer it intravenously.
* **Can I mix it with other insulins?** Do not mix it with other insulins without specific instructions from your doctor or diabetes educator.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor or diabetes educator for guidance. Do not double the next dose.
* **How do I store it?** Keep it refrigerated, but do not freeze. Once opened, it may be stored at room temperature for up to 28 days.  Always check the product label for specific storage instructions.
* **What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?** Consume a fast-acting source of sugar (e.g., glucose tablets, fruit juice) and then follow up with a more complex carbohydrate if needed.  Always inform your healthcare provider if you experience frequent episodes of hypoglycemia.
* **How is my dosage determined?** Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your blood glucose levels, diet, activity level, and other individual factors. Regular monitoring and adjustments are usually necessary.
