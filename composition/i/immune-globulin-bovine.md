# Immune Globulin (Bovine)
### Generic Name
Immune Globulin (Bovine)

### Usage
Immune globulin (bovine) is a medical food used to manage chronic diarrhea and loose stools.  It's specifically designed as a dietary supplement to help individuals experiencing persistent digestive issues.  While not a cure for underlying causes of diarrhea, it aims to improve symptoms and promote the restoration of normal bowel function.  It's important to note that this product should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the severity of diarrhea and the age of the patient.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Adults (Chronic Diarrhea/Loose Stools):**  The starting dose is determined by the number of loose or watery stools per day.

* ≤ 5 stools: 1-2 packets daily
* 6-10 stools: 2 packets daily
* 11-15 stools: 3 packets daily
* >16 stools: 4 packets daily

Once stools normalize (1-2 stools daily with good consistency, usually within 2-4 weeks), the dose can be reduced to 1 packet per day.  The dose may be increased during flare-ups or decreased if mild constipation occurs. There is no stated time limit on usage.

**Children ≥ 2 years (Chronic Diarrhea/Loose Stools):** ½ packet once daily (or in divided doses), mixed into liquids or soft foods.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, although the frequency isn't specified, include:

* Mild nausea
* Constipation
* Headache
* Increased urination

Serious side effects are rare but should be reported to your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it is believed that immunoglobulins in the product bind to microbial components with immune-activating potential. This binding may prevent these components from entering the intestinal lining, reducing inflammation. This dampening of the immune response helps restore intestinal homeostasis, leading to improved gut function and nutrient absorption.

### Precautions
* **Contraindication:** Immune globulin (bovine) is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to beef or related components.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  There's no data on the use of this product during pregnancy, labor/delivery, or breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor before use.
* **Administration:** Mix each packet in at least 4 ounces of liquid (warm water is preferred, but not hot water to avoid protein degradation). Stir well; do not shake.  It can also be mixed with soft foods. Consume immediately.
* **Medical Supervision:** Immune globulin (bovine) should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
