# Idebenone
### Generic Name
Idebenone

### Usage

Idebenone is primarily used to treat visual impairment associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and to manage Friedreich's ataxia.  While not yet approved for this in all regions, it also shows promise and is sometimes used in cosmetic treatments for wrinkles.  The use of idebenone in these conditions stems from its ability to act as an antioxidant and improve cellular energy production.  It's important to note that while showing promise in preclinical and early clinical trials, the use of idebenone in other neurodegenerative diseases is still largely under investigation.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's weight.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional.

**Friedreich's Ataxia:**

* **Low-dose therapy (oral):** Patients weighing ≤45 kg receive 150 mg three times daily (TID).  Patients >45 kg receive 300 mg TID.  After at least six months of low-dose therapy, an increase to a higher dose may be considered if the patient shows clinical benefit and tolerates the medication well.
* **High-dose therapy (oral):** Patients weighing ≤45 kg receive 450 mg TID. Patients >45 kg receive 750 mg TID. A return to the lower dose may be necessary after six months if no further improvement is seen.

**Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):**

* **Oral:** The usual dose is 300 mg TID.

**Cosmetic Treatment of Wrinkles (Topical):**

* **Cream (1%):** Apply a pea-sized amount to the cleansed and dried face and neck once daily for a week. If tolerated, application can be increased to twice daily.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of idebenone in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic or renal impairment; however, caution is advised in these populations.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Headache

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Leukocytopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Agranulocytosis (severe deficiency of granulocytes, a type of white blood cell)
* Abnormal liver function test (LFT) values
* Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
* Allergic reactions (including itching, burning, redness, or swelling with topical use)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Idebenone is structurally similar to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10), a vital component of the electron transport chain in cellular respiration.  Although its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed to function as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.  It may also improve electron flow within the respiratory chain, boosting energy production at a cellular level. This improved energy production is thought to be beneficial in conditions affecting mitochondrial function, such as LHON and Friedreich's ataxia.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Idebenone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to idebenone or any components of its formulation.
* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of chromaturia (colored urine), leukocytopenia, agranulocytosis, abnormal LFT results, and allergic reactions (especially with topical use).
* **Caution:**  Exercise caution when using idebenone in elderly patients and those with hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with certain medications (CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers) might affect idebenone metabolism. Avoid concurrent use with pimozide. Idebenone may also alter the levels/effects of other medications. Consult with your healthcare provider about potential drug interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of idebenone during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take idebenone with food?** A: Yes, it's recommended to take idebenone with food, ideally a high-fat meal, to improve absorption.

* **Q: How should I store idebenone?** A: Store idebenone as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking idebenone?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a balanced diet is always recommended.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking idebenone suddenly?** A: No,  do not stop taking idebenone suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Your doctor will advise you on the best way to gradually discontinue the medication, if necessary.
