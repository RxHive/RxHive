# Iobenguane Sulfate I 131
### Generic Name
Iobenguane Sulfate I 131

### Usage
Iobenguane sulfate I 131 is a radioactive medicine used to treat pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.  These are rare tumors that develop from cells of the adrenal gland or similar cells elsewhere in the body.  The medication is specifically used in cases where the tumors are unresectable (cannot be surgically removed), locally advanced (have spread to nearby tissues), or metastatic (have spread to distant parts of the body) and the patient requires systemic anticancer therapy.  It's important to note that this treatment is given only to patients whose tumors have shown up on a specific type of scan called an "iobenguane scan".

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma):**

The dosage is divided into two parts: a dosimetric dose and a therapeutic dose.

* **Dosimetric Dose:** This dose is given to determine the optimal therapeutic dose for the individual patient based on how the body processes the medication. The dose is calculated based on weight:
    * Patients weighing >50 kg: 185–222 MBq (5 or 6 mCi) intravenously (IV)
    * Patients weighing ≤50 kg: 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1 mCi/kg) IV
    *  Precise dosimetry, distribution assessment, and critical organ threshold values should be carefully considered and calculated as per product labeling.

* **Therapeutic Dose:** This is the actual treatment dose and is also weight-based, given intravenously (IV).  It's crucial to remember that this dose is adjusted based on the dosimetric data. A total of two therapeutic doses are given, at least 90 days apart.
    * Patients weighing >62.5 kg: 18500 MBq (500 mCi)
    * Patients weighing ≤62.5 kg: 296 MBq/kg (8 mCi/kg)

**Pediatric Dosage (Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma):**

Dosage for children 12 years and older follows a similar structure to adult dosage, with the dosimetric dose aiming to determine the appropriate therapeutic dose based on individual characteristics.

* **Dosimetric Dose:**
    * Weight ≤50 kg: 3.7 MBq/kg (0.1 mCi/kg) IV
    * Weight >50 kg: 185–222 MBq (5 or 6 mCi) IV
    * Multiple scans are necessary to calculate the radiation dose to organs.

* **Therapeutic Dose:**
    * Weight ≤62.5 kg: 296 MBq/kg (8 mCi/kg) IV
    * Weight >62.5 kg: 18500 MBq (500 mCi) IV
    * Two doses are administered, with at least 90 days between them.


**Important Considerations for both Adult and Pediatric Dosages:**

Before and after each dose of Iobenguane sulfate I 131, several supportive measures are necessary:

* **Thyroid Blockade:**  Administer inorganic iodine to protect the thyroid gland.
* **Hydration:** Increase fluid intake to at least 2 liters per day.
* **Antiemetics:** Administer antiemetics to prevent nausea and vomiting.
* **Medications Affecting Catecholamines:** Medications affecting catecholamine uptake or depletion should be discontinued for a specific time before and after Iobenguane sulfate I 131 administration.  Refer to product labeling for specific guidelines.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** The therapeutic dose might need adjustment in cases of hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Dose adjustments are also necessary if there are issues with bone marrow function and other factors. Consult product labeling for further guidance.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  (Occurring in more than 10% of patients)

* Cardiovascular: Hypotension (low blood pressure), hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Nervous system: Fatigue, dizziness, headache

* Other:  Adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer), other malignancies, pneumonitis (lung inflammation)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Iobenguane sulfate I 131 is a radiopharmaceutical.  It's structurally similar to norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter.  Because of this similarity, it's taken up by tissues rich in norepinephrine, such as the adrenal medulla (the inner part of the adrenal gland) where pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas originate.  The radioactive iodine component then delivers radiation directly to the tumor cells, helping to destroy them.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer’s labeling, however there are several situations where it is not appropriate.
* **Interactions:**  Several medications can interact with Iobenguane sulfate I 131, potentially reducing its effectiveness. These include certain antidepressants, sympathomimetics, and other drugs that affect norepinephrine levels.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of bone marrow suppression, worsening of pre-existing hypertension, hypothyroidism, infertility, gastrointestinal toxicity, pneumonitis, renal toxicity, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or acute leukemias.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Iobenguane sulfate I 131 is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning it may pose risks to a developing fetus.  Women of reproductive age should have a pregnancy test before treatment, and both men and women should use effective contraception. Breastfeeding is not recommended during therapy and for 80 days afterward.
* **Other Precautions:**  Appropriate handling and disposal of the radioactive material are crucial for minimizing exposure to patients and healthcare personnel.  This medication should only be administered under the supervision of experienced professionals trained in handling radioactive materials.
