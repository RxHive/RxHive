# Isosorbide Mononitrate + Aspirin
### Generic Name
Isosorbide Mononitrate/Aspirin

**Note:**  Isosorbide mononitrate and aspirin are often combined in a single medication, but they are also available individually.  This information pertains to the combination product.  Always refer to your specific prescription's labeling for accurate dosage and usage instructions.

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to prevent cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, in patients who have already experienced a heart attack or have stable angina (chest pain).  Isosorbide mononitrate is a long-acting nitrate that helps to dilate (widen) blood vessels, improving blood flow to the heart and reducing chest pain. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent, meaning it prevents blood platelets from sticking together and forming clots that can block arteries.  By working together, isosorbide mononitrate and aspirin reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.

While the primary use is in preventing cardiovascular events in high-risk patients,  a doctor *might* prescribe this combination in other situations, but this is less common and always based on individual patient needs and assessment.  It's crucial to follow your physician's instructions carefully.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on individual patient needs and medical history.  A physician will determine the appropriate dosage.  There is no standard dosage that can be safely provided here. **Never adjust the dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.**

Dosage forms typically include tablets.  The medication is usually taken orally.  Liquid forms are not common for this combination. Intravenous (IV) administration of this specific combination is not typical. Isosorbide mononitrate and aspirin are sometimes administered intravenously separately in specific clinical scenarios, but thatâ€™s outside the scope of this combination drug.

**It is crucial to strictly follow your physician's prescribed dosage regimen.**


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Lightheadedness
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Heartburn

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding (black, tarry stools, blood in vomit)
* Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.  Always consult your physician or pharmacist if you are concerned about side effects.


### How it Works

Isosorbide mononitrate works by relaxing the smooth muscles in blood vessel walls, causing vasodilation. This widening of blood vessels reduces the workload on the heart and improves blood flow, thus relieving chest pain and reducing the risk of heart attacks.  Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation (clumping), thereby reducing the formation of blood clots that could lead to heart attacks or strokes. The combination of these two mechanisms provides a synergistic effect in preventing cardiovascular events.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Inform your doctor if you have allergies to nitrates, salicylates (like aspirin), or any other medications.
* **Other Medications:**  This medication may interact with other drugs, including other blood thinners, nitroglycerin, erectile dysfunction medications, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Kidney or Liver Disease:**  Individuals with kidney or liver disease may require dosage adjustments. Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your condition.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  This medication can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.  If you have a history of ulcers or bleeding problems, discuss this with your doctor.
* **Alcohol:**  Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of side effects and should be avoided or limited while taking this medication.
