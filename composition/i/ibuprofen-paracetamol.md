# Ibuprofen + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Ibuprofen + Paracetamol (also known as Ibuprofen + Acetaminophen)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and reduce fever.  It's often used for headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, toothaches, colds, and the flu.  The combination provides a broader range of pain relief than either ibuprofen or paracetamol alone, as they work through different mechanisms.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea.  These are more common with ibuprofen.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).  Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare, more likely with high doses or long-term use, particularly with paracetamol.
* **Kidney problems:** Rare, more likely with high doses or long-term use, particularly with ibuprofen.
* **Headache:**  Can be a side effect, especially with regular use.
* **Drowsiness:** Though less common than with other pain relievers.

**How it Works:**

* **Ibuprofen:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever and provides pain relief through a different mechanism, which is not fully understood but is believed to involve affecting certain enzymes in the brain.  The combination provides broader pain relief and better fever reduction than either drug alone.
