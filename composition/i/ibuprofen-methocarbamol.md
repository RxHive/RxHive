# Ibuprofen + Methocarbamol

**Generic Name:** Ibuprofen + Methocarbamol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions, such as muscle strains, sprains, and back pain.  Ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces pain and inflammation. Methocarbamol, a muscle relaxant, helps to relieve muscle spasms and stiffness.  It's important to note that this combination is typically used for short-term relief and is not a cure for underlying conditions.  A doctor should always be consulted for appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but can include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, stomach upset, heartburn.
* **Less Common but More Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing),  liver problems (jaundice, dark urine), kidney problems, increased risk of bleeding (especially with prolonged use or in individuals with bleeding disorders), low blood pressure, confusion.
* **Rare but Serious:** Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction).


**How it Works:**

* **Ibuprofen:**  Inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Methocarbamol:**  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it is believed to act on the central nervous system to relax muscles and relieve muscle spasms.  It's thought to affect the transmission of nerve impulses in the spinal cord.
