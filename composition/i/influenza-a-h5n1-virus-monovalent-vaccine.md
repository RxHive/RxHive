# Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Monovalent Vaccine
### Generic Name
Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Monovalent Vaccine

### Usage
The Influenza A (H5N1) virus monovalent vaccine is used for active immunization to prevent illness caused by the H5N1 subtype of the influenza A virus.  This vaccine is crucial for individuals at high risk of exposure to the virus, which can cause a severe and potentially fatal form of influenza.  The primary use is preventative; it aims to build immunity before exposure, reducing the likelihood of infection.  There are currently no secondary uses officially recognized for this vaccine beyond preventing H5N1 influenza.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥18 years):**

* **For those at increased risk of exposure:**  A 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection is given, followed by a second 0.5 mL dose 21 days later.  The specific formulation (MF59-adjuvanted or AS03-adjuvanted emulsion) will determine the precise dosage form.
* **Adults aged 18-64 years:** A 1 mL IM injection of the suspension (90 mcg/mL) is administered, followed by a second 1 mL dose approximately 28 days later (acceptable range: 21-35 days).


**Pediatrics (≥6 months):**

* **Infants and children/adolescents ≤17 years (AS03-adjuvanted emulsion):** A 0.25 mL IM injection is given, followed by a second 0.25 mL dose 21 days later.
* **Infants and children/adolescents ≤17 years (MF59-adjuvanted emulsion):** A 0.5 mL IM injection is given, followed by a second 0.5 mL dose 21 days later.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Rare Side Effects (frequency <1%):**

* Dermatologic: Skin rash
* Local: Bruising at injection site


**Serious but Less Common:**  Anaphylaxis, shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (bursitis or tendinopathy), syncope (fainting) with neurological symptoms, apnea (in premature infants), febrile seizures.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious adverse effects occur.

### How it Works

The precise mechanism of action isn't fully understood.  However, the vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the hemagglutinin protein found on the surface of the H5N1 influenza virus. These antibodies then help prevent the virus from attaching to and infecting cells in the respiratory tract.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) to any vaccine component (including egg protein) or a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (especially emulsion formulations).

**Warnings and Precautions:** Increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, shoulder injuries, syncope, apnea (in premature infants), and febrile seizures. Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders, those on anticoagulant therapy, those with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and in breastfeeding women.

**Drug Interactions:**  The vaccine may interact with certain medications, including belimumab, doxofylline, fingolimod, immunosuppressants, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13-valent), and venetoclax.  Consult a healthcare professional to discuss potential interactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the vaccine take to be effective?** A:  It generally takes about 2 weeks after the second dose for the body to develop adequate immunity.

* **Q: Can I get the flu from this vaccine?** A: No. This is an inactivated (killed) virus vaccine; it cannot cause influenza.  Some mild side effects are possible, but they are generally temporary.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a serious side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Store as directed by your healthcare provider or according to the manufacturer’s instructions, usually under refrigeration.

* **Q:  Is this vaccine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: Use with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Consult your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks.

* **Q: Are there any age restrictions?** A:  The vaccine is approved for use in individuals aged 6 months and older, but specific formulations and dosages vary by age.  Consult your physician for appropriate dosage for individuals below the age of 18 years.
