# Istradefylline
### Generic Name
Istradefylline

### Usage
Istradefylline is used as an adjunctive treatment for adult patients with Parkinson's disease who experience "off" episodes.  "Off" episodes refer to periods when the benefits of Parkinson's medication wear off, leading to a return of symptoms. Istradefylline is not a first-line treatment for Parkinson's disease; it's used in addition to levodopa/carbidopa, standard medications for managing the disease.  It aims to reduce the duration and severity of these "off" periods, improving the overall quality of life for patients.

### Dosage
**Adults (Parkinson's Disease):** The typical starting dose is 20 mg once daily (OD).  This dose may be increased to a maximum of 40 mg OD, based on individual response and tolerability.  Importantly, initial dose titration (gradual increase) is not necessary.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of istradefylline in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with liver problems.  Those with mild impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) need no adjustment.  Patients with moderate impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) should receive 20 mg OD, with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg.  Istradefylline should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 15 mL/min or greater, no dosage adjustment is needed.  Dosage information for patients with CrCl less than 15 mL/min or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis is not available.
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** When used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (medications that affect how the body processes istradefylline), the maximum dose of istradefylline should be 20 mg OD.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Istradefylline should be avoided with strong CYP3A4 inducers.
* **Tobacco Use:** For patients who smoke 20 or more cigarettes daily (or an equivalent amount of other tobacco products), the recommended dose is 40 mg OD.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action of istradefylline in Parkinson's disease isn't fully understood. However, research indicates it acts as an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the activity of adenosine at specific receptors in the brain.  Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that can influence movement control. By blocking adenosine at these receptors, istradefylline may help improve motor function and reduce the severity of "off" episodes in Parkinson's disease.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** Istradefylline may harm the developing fetus.  Its use during pregnancy is not recommended.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception while taking this medication.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It's unknown whether istradefylline is excreted in breast milk. The decision to breastfeed during treatment should involve careful consideration of the risks and benefits for both the mother and infant.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver problems; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Increased Risk:** Istradefylline may increase the risk of dyskinesia, hallucinations/psychotic behavior, and impulse control disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:** Istradefylline can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Patients with Psychotic Disorders:** Avoid use in patients with a major psychotic disorder.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store istradefylline?** A: Store istradefylline as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
