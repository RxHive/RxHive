Imipenem/cilastatin is a combination antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in various parts of the body, including:

* **Other severe infections:**  where other antibiotics have failed or are not suitable.

It's important to note that imipenem/cilastatin is typically reserved for serious infections requiring hospitalization, and its use is determined by a physician based on the specific infection and its severity.  It's not a first-line antibiotic for minor infections.

* **Pseudomembranous colitis:** Inflammation of the colon.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:** Indicating potential liver damage.

This is not an exhaustive list of all possible side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for more information.

**How it Works:**

Imipenem is a carbapenem antibiotic. It works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to build their cell walls.  This disruption causes the bacterial cells to become fragile and ultimately die.  Cilastatin is a dehydropeptidase I inhibitor.  It prevents the breakdown of imipenem by the kidneys, allowing for higher blood levels of the active antibiotic and better treatment of infections.  Essentially, cilastatin protects imipenem, ensuring it reaches its target effectively.
