# Imipenem + Cilastatin
### Generic Name
Imipenem/Cilastatin

### Usage

Imipenem/Cilastatin is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of serious bacterial infections.  Its primary use is for treating infections caused by bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.  Specific infections it's used for include:

* **Lower respiratory tract infections:**  Including pneumonia, particularly in hospitalized patients or those at risk for multi-drug resistant bacteria.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Such as cellulitis and abscesses, especially when severe or complicated.  It is often used in severe cases like necrotizing fasciitis (often in combination with other antibiotics).
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Particularly complicated UTIs or those involving pyelonephritis (kidney infection), especially in patients at high risk for multi-drug resistant organisms.
* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen, often following surgery or due to perforation of organs.  This includes peritonitis (infection of the lining of the abdomen).
* **Gynecologic infections:** Infections of the female reproductive organs.
* **Bone and joint infections:**  Osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) and septic arthritis (infection of a joint).
* **Endocarditis:**  Infection of the inner lining of the heart.
* **Other uses:**  Imipenem/Cilastatin may be used off-label (meaning not specifically approved but sometimes used by doctors) to treat certain other infections, like those caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei* (melioidosis),  nontuberculous mycobacteria, febrile neutropenia, and surgical site infections.  Use in these situations should be guided by a physician's judgment and susceptibility testing.

### Dosage

**Dosage is highly dependent on the infection, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  The information below is for general guidance only and should not substitute for a doctor's prescription.** Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Imipenem/Cilastatin is administered intravenously (IV).

**Adults:**  Dosage ranges widely from 250mg to 1000mg every 6-8 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 4000mg.  The specific dose and frequency will be determined by your doctor based on the severity and type of infection and your kidney function.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for those with impaired kidney function (see Dosage Adjustments section).

**Children:** Dosage is typically based on weight (mg/kg/day), usually administered every 6 hours. The exact dosage and frequency will be determined by the doctor based on the child's age, weight, and the type of infection.  Imipenem/Cilastatin is generally *not* recommended for treating infections of the central nervous system (CNS) in children due to the increased risk of seizures.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Significant dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with kidney problems (renal impairment).  The dose needs to be reduced or the dosing interval increased to avoid toxic buildup.  Hemodialysis patients require special dosing considerations, often with administration after dialysis sessions.  Hepatic impairment generally does not require dosage adjustment.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Decreased white blood cell count
* Increased liver enzymes (AST, ALT)

**Less common but serious side effects:**

* Seizures (particularly in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or kidney problems)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from rash to anaphylaxis)
* *Clostridium difficile* infection (a serious intestinal infection)
* Kidney problems (including acute kidney failure)


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Imipenem is a carbapenem antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Bacteria require cell walls for survival; interfering with their construction leads to cell death. Cilastatin is included in the formulation to protect imipenem from breakdown by enzymes in the kidneys, allowing for better use of the drug.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Imipenem/Cilastatin is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to carbapenems or penicillins (due to cross-reactivity).
* **Kidney problems:** Dosage adjustments are critical in individuals with impaired kidney function.  Imipenem/Cilastatin should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders:**  There is an increased risk of seizures, especially in patients with a history of seizures or CNS disorders.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** The safety of Imipenem/Cilastatin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established, and its use should be carefully considered.  It should only be used if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.
* **Drug interactions:** Several drugs can interact with Imipenem/Cilastatin, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Superinfections:** Prolonged use can increase the risk of secondary infections caused by other resistant organisms, such as yeast infections.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Imipenem/Cilastatin orally?** A: No, it is only administered intravenously.
* **Q: How long do I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment depends entirely on the type and severity of the infection and your response to treatment.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance. Do not attempt to double up on doses.
* **Q: How should I store Imipenem/Cilastatin?** A: Store according to the instructions provided on the medication label, usually at room temperature and away from direct sunlight.
* **Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking Imipenem/Cilastatin?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol during treatment, as it may exacerbate side effects like nausea and vomiting.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication when I feel better?** A: No, you must complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early may lead to a recurrence of infection and development of antibiotic resistance.
