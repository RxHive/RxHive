# Inositol nicotinate
### Generic Name
Inositol Nicotinate

### Usage
Inositol nicotinate is primarily used as a vasodilator, meaning it helps to widen blood vessels. This widening improves blood flow, which is why it's often used to address symptoms related to peripheral vascular disease (PVD).  PVD encompasses conditions where blood flow to the limbs is restricted, leading to pain, numbness, and coldness, particularly in the legs and feet. Inositol nicotinate may offer some relief from these symptoms.  While not a primary treatment, it's sometimes used as a supplemental therapy to manage symptoms associated with high cholesterol and high triglycerides, although more research is needed to solidify its efficacy in this area. It's crucial to remember that inositol nicotinate is not a substitute for prescribed medications for managing cholesterol or triglyceride levels.


### Dosage
Dosage for inositol nicotinate varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablets, capsules) and the individual's condition.  There isn't a universally established dosage guideline, and it's vital to follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional or as indicated on the product packaging.  Generally, oral dosages range from 500mg to 3000mg per day, often divided into multiple doses.  Intravenous administration is not a typical route for this medication.  Adjustments to dosage may be necessary based on individual responses and the severity of symptoms.  Children's use is not well-established and should be determined only under the direct supervision of a physician.  

### Side Effects
Common side effects of inositol nicotinate are generally mild and can include:

* Flushing or redness of the skin
* Itching
* Mild gastrointestinal upset (e.g., nausea, stomach discomfort)
* Headache

Less common but more serious side effects are rare but possible and should prompt immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
* Significant drop in blood pressure

If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Inositol nicotinate's vasodilating effect is believed to stem from its ability to release niacin (vitamin B3) slowly within the body.  Unlike immediate-release niacin, which can cause intense flushing, inositol nicotinate's gradual release minimizes this side effect.  The released niacin contributes to vasodilation by influencing the body's blood vessels, allowing them to relax and expand, thereby increasing blood flow.  While the exact mechanisms are still being studied, this slow-release mechanism is considered key to its therapeutic action.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Individuals with known allergies to niacin or inositol should avoid inositol nicotinate.  Those with severe liver disease or active peptic ulcers should also exercise caution and consult their physician before use.
* **Drug Interactions:** Inositol nicotinate may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting blood pressure or blood sugar levels.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** There is limited data on the safety of inositol nicotinate during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of inositol nicotinate.  Close monitoring and potentially adjusted dosages are advisable.
