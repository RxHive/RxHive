# Immune globulin subcutaneous (human, 20% solution)
### Generic Name
Immune globulin subcutaneous (human, 20% solution)

### Usage

Immune globulin subcutaneous (human, 20% solution) is primarily used as replacement therapy for primary humoral immunodeficiency in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older.  Primary humoral immunodeficiency refers to conditions where the body doesn't produce enough antibodies to fight off infections effectively. This medication provides a concentrated dose of antibodies to help bolster the immune system's response.  While its primary use is in immunodeficiency, it may also be considered in other situations where antibody replacement is needed, although this would be determined on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors like the patient's weight, the severity of their immunodeficiency, and their response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.

**Adults:**  Dosage is determined by converting the previous monthly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) dose to an equivalent weekly subcutaneous dose, with adjustments based on individual factors.  A dose adjustment factor of 1.30 is often used when switching from IVIG.  The medication can be administered frequently (2-7 times per week), weekly, or bi-weekly, with similar exposure levels achieved at steady state. To convert grams to milliliters (mL), multiply the grams by 5.

**Children (≥2 years):**  The dosage is generally the same as for adults, but always tailored to the child's specific needs and determined by a physician.  This medication is not recommended for infants younger than 2 years old due to a lack of safety and effectiveness data.


**Administration:** Immune globulin subcutaneous (human, 20% solution) is administered via subcutaneous injection.  Multiple injection sites (1-4) are typically used simultaneously, maintaining a distance of at least 2-4 inches between injection sites.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (≥5%):

* Infusion-site reactions: Erythema (redness), pain, swelling, bruising, nodule formation, itching, induration (firmness), scab formation, and edema.
* Systemic reactions: Cough and diarrhea.

Less common but serious side effects:  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

* Severe hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Thrombosis (blood clots)
* Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS)
* Renal dysfunction or failure
* Hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells)
* Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Immune globulin subcutaneous (human, 20% solution) works by supplying a broad range of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.  These antibodies directly target and neutralize various infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, parasites, and mycoplasmas) and their toxins.  The medication also contains antibodies that interact with immune system cells, modulating their activity. While the full mechanism isn't completely understood, the overall effect is a significant boost to the body's immune defense.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, those with a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to subcutaneous immune globulin, and IgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity to immune globulin.
* **Interactions:**  Live attenuated virus vaccines (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, varicella) may have their effectiveness reduced by this medication.  Discuss all medications and supplements with your healthcare provider.
* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of thrombosis (blood clots), particularly in older adults or those with pre-existing conditions that increase clotting risk.  Patients at risk should receive the lowest effective dose. Adequate hydration is important.  There's also a risk of aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS), renal dysfunction, hemolysis, TRALI, and false-positive serological test results.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety during pregnancy hasn't been established.  Use caution during pregnancy and lactation.  The benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against the potential risks.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A: The effectiveness depends on the individual and the condition being treated.  Improvement in immune function may take several weeks.  Regular monitoring of IgG levels is essential.

* **Q: How is it stored?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Typically, this involves refrigeration.

* **Q: Can I miss a dose?** A: No, maintain a regular schedule.  Contact your doctor if you miss a dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately if you notice any unusual symptoms.

* **Q:  Are there any specific dietary recommendations?** A: Maintaining good hydration is recommended before and after administration.  There are no specific dietary restrictions, but a healthy diet is always advised.
