# Insulin Isophane/NPH + Human Insulin/Soluble Insulin

**Generic Name:** Insulin Isophane/NPH + Human Insulin/Soluble Insulin (often labeled as NPH/Regular Insulin)

**Usage:** This combination insulin is used to control high blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes.  It's a pre-mixed formulation combining two types of insulin:

* **NPH (Isophane) Insulin:**  An intermediate-acting insulin that starts working within 1-2 hours, peaks in 4-12 hours, and lasts for about 18-24 hours.  It provides a longer-lasting background insulin level.
* **Regular (Soluble) Human Insulin:** A short-acting insulin that starts working quickly (within 30 minutes), peaks in 2-3 hours, and lasts for about 5-8 hours.  It helps cover the immediate needs of the body for insulin, often to manage blood glucose spikes after meals.

The combination is used to provide both a basal (background) level of insulin and a bolus (covering meal) level of insulin, simplifying the injection regimen for some patients compared to using separate injections of short and intermediate-acting insulin.  The precise ratio of NPH to regular insulin varies depending on the specific product and the individual's needs (e.g., 70/30, 50/50 mixtures are common).

**Side Effects:**  Like all insulins, this combination can cause side effects, including:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect, characterized by sweating, trembling, weakness, dizziness, confusion, and potentially loss of consciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:** Redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:** Insulin can cause fluid retention and increase appetite, leading to weight gain.
* **Lipohypertrophy:** Thickening or hardening of the fatty tissue at the injection site.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rare but can include rash, hives, itching, or difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** This insulin combination works by lowering blood sugar levels.  Insulin helps glucose (sugar) move from the bloodstream into cells, where it's used for energy. The NPH component provides a steady supply of insulin throughout the day, while the regular insulin helps to manage blood sugar spikes after meals.


**FAQs:**

* **How is it administered?**  This insulin is usually given by subcutaneous injection (under the skin) using a syringe or an insulin pen.  Never administer intravenously.
* **Do I need to refrigerate it?**  Once opened, it should be refrigerated.  Unopened vials can often be stored at room temperature.  Always check the product labeling for specific storage instructions.
* **How do I adjust my dose?**  Never adjust your dose without consulting your doctor or diabetes care team.  Changes in diet, exercise, or illness can affect your insulin requirements.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor or diabetes care team for guidance.  Never double up on a dose.
* **What are the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar?**  Symptoms include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  Carry a fast-acting sugar source (like glucose tablets or juice) to treat hypoglycemia.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Many medications can affect blood sugar levels. Discuss all medications you take with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Can I exercise while taking this insulin?**  Exercise is important for managing diabetes, but it can affect blood sugar levels.  Your doctor or diabetes care team can advise you on how to manage your insulin and exercise.
