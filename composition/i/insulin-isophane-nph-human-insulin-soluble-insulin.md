# Insulin Isophane/NPH + Human Insulin/Soluble Insulin

**Generic Name:** Insulin Isophane/NPH + Human Insulin/Soluble Insulin

**Usage:** This medication is a combination of two types of insulin: NPH (Isophane Insulin) and regular (soluble) human insulin.  It's primarily used to treat **diabetes mellitus**, specifically type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  The combination allows for both a rapid-acting effect from the soluble insulin and a longer-lasting effect from the NPH insulin, providing better blood sugar control throughout the day.  While its primary use is managing blood glucose levels, it may be used in conjunction with other diabetes medications as directed by a physician.

**Dosage:**  Dosage is highly individualized and determined by a doctor based on factors like blood glucose levels, age, weight, diet, and activity level.  It is typically administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin), never orally.  There are no standard dosages for children or adults that can be provided here; a healthcare professional must tailor the dose to the individual's needs.  The medication comes in different strengths (units/mL) and vial sizes.  Incorrect dosage can lead to serious health complications.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and injection technique meticulously.


**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar – symptoms include sweating, trembling, dizziness, confusion, hunger), injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching), weight gain.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Severe hypoglycemia (can lead to unconsciousness or coma), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), lipohypertrophy (build-up of fat tissue at the injection site), insulin resistance.

**Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**  This insulin combination works by mimicking the body's natural insulin.  The soluble human insulin acts quickly to lower blood sugar after meals.  The NPH insulin provides a longer-lasting effect, controlling blood sugar between meals and overnight.  Both types of insulin facilitate glucose uptake from the bloodstream into cells, where it can be used for energy.  This process regulates blood glucose levels and prevents the complications associated with high blood sugar.

**Popular Brand Names (India):**  Specific brand names vary considerably by region and manufacturer in India.  It's best to consult a pharmacist or physician for available brands in your area.  They can also offer information on generic alternatives, which are usually more affordable.

**Precautions:**

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with severe hypoglycemia or those with a history of severe allergic reactions to insulin.
* **Drug Interactions:** Certain medications, including some oral contraceptives, steroids, and beta-blockers, can affect insulin's effectiveness.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Insulin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires close monitoring by a healthcare professional.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Elderly:** Older adults may require lower doses due to reduced kidney and liver function.  They are also at increased risk for hypoglycemia.
* **Children:** Children require careful dosage adjustments based on their growth and blood sugar levels.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it in the refrigerator (2°C to 8°C).  Do not freeze. Once opened, it can usually be kept at room temperature (below 30°C) for a limited time—check the label for specific instructions.
* **Q: Can I mix this insulin with other insulins in the same syringe?** A:  This may be possible depending on the specific types of insulin involved. Always follow your doctor's instructions and consult a healthcare professional for guidance on mixing insulins.  Mixing incorrectly can alter the effect of the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately.  Do not double the dose to compensate for a missed dose.
* **Q: How long does this medication take to start working?** A: The effects vary depending on the individual and the dose, but generally, the soluble insulin starts working quickly (within 30 minutes), while the NPH insulin's effect begins after 1-2 hours and lasts longer.
* **Q: What are the symptoms of a serious allergic reaction?** A: Symptoms include difficulty breathing, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
