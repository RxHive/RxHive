# Iodipamide
### Generic Name
Iodipamide (Iodipamide Meglumine)

### Usage
Iodipamide is a water-soluble contrast medium primarily used in intravenous cholangiography and cholecystography.  These procedures involve injecting iodipamide into a vein to visualize the gallbladder and biliary ducts (bile ducts) through X-ray imaging.  This visualization aids in diagnosing various abdominal conditions, including:

* **Differential diagnosis of acute abdominal conditions:**  Helping to distinguish between different causes of abdominal pain.
* **Evaluation of biliary ducts:** Particularly useful after gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) to assess the remaining bile ducts.
* **Gallbladder evaluation:** In patients who can't tolerate or absorb oral contrast agents for gallbladder imaging.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For cholangiography and cholecystography, the typical intravenous dose is 20 mL administered slowly over 10 minutes.  The dose should not be repeated within 24 hours.

**Children:**  For cholangiography and cholecystography, the intravenous dose is 0.3 to 0.6 mL/kg of body weight, administered slowly over 10 minutes. The maximum dose is 20 mL, and repetition within 24 hours is contraindicated.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  In fact, iodipamide is contraindicated in patients with severe impairment of both liver and kidney function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of side effects isn't consistently defined in available information.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Anaphylactoid reaction (severe allergic-like reaction)
*   Cardiac abnormalities
*   Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of skin)
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*   Eyelid edema (swelling)
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Laryngospasm (spasm of the voice box)
*   Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis
*   Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome
*   Renal failure
*   Altered thyroid hormone levels (transient)
*   Hypothyroidism

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Iodipamide is an iodinated contrast medium.  Iodine atoms within the molecule absorb X-rays differently than the surrounding tissues. This difference in absorption allows the gallbladder and biliary ducts, which are filled with iodipamide after intravenous injection, to be clearly visualized on X-ray images.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to iodipamide, its salts, or any component of the formulation.
* Intrathecal (spinal) use.
* Concomitant severe renal and hepatic impairment.

**Warnings and Increased Risk:**

*   Contrast media reactions (allergic-type reactions)
*   Severe cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions (skin reactions)
*   Extravasation reactions (leakage from the vein during injection)

**Use with Caution:** In patients with hypertension, myasthenia gravis, pheochromocytoma, severe renal impairment, or those who are debilitated.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Iodipamide may cross the placenta.  Use during pregnancy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  It's excreted in breast milk, but the amount is low, and breastfeeding can usually continue.  However, mothers who prefer to temporarily stop breastfeeding should pump and discard milk for 12-24 hours after administration.


**Drug Interactions:** Loop diuretics may increase the potential for kidney damage associated with iodinated contrast agents.


### FAQs

**Q: How is iodipamide stored?**

A:  Storage instructions should be found on the product labeling.  Generally, iodipamide solutions are stored at room temperature and protected from light.

**Q: What should I do if I experience a reaction?**

A:  Immediately stop the infusion and contact your healthcare provider.  Reactions can range from mild to severe, and prompt medical attention is crucial.

**Q:  Is iodipamide safe for everyone?**

A:  While generally safe when used as directed, iodipamide has contraindications and precautions, especially for individuals with certain medical conditions, such as kidney or liver problems, or allergies to iodine. Always discuss your medical history with your doctor before receiving this medication.

**Q:  How long does it take for iodipamide to be eliminated from the body?**

A: Iodipamide is primarily excreted by the kidneys. The exact elimination time varies depending on individual factors such as kidney function, but it's typically within a few days.
