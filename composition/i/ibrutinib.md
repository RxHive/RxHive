# Ibrutinib

**Generic Name:** Ibrutinib

**Usage:** Ibrutinib is a targeted therapy used to treat several types of blood cancers, including:

* **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL):**  It's used in various stages, including previously untreated CLL and relapsed/refractory CLL.
* **Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL):**  It's used in relapsed/refractory MCL.
* **Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia (WM):** It's used in relapsed/refractory WM.
* **Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL):** It's used in relapsed/refractory SLL.
* **Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL):** It's used in certain types of relapsed or refractory MZL.
* **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL):** In specific subtypes and situations.


**Side Effects:**  Ibrutinib can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity from mild to serious.  Some common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** Often a significant side effect requiring management.
* **Bruising and bleeding:** Due to its effect on platelets.
* **Fatigue:**  A common side effect.
* **Muscle aches and pains:** Myalgia.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Gastrointestinal upset.
* **Headache:**  Commonly reported.
* **Rash:**  Skin reactions can occur.
* **Infections:**  Increased risk of infections due to immune suppression.
* **Atrial fibrillation (Afib):** Irregular heartbeat, a serious potential side effect.
* **Pneumonia:** Increased risk of lung infections.
* **Second primary malignancies:**  Increased risk of developing other cancers.


**How it Works:** Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.  BTK is an enzyme crucial for the survival and growth of certain types of immune cells, including those involved in many blood cancers. By blocking BTK, ibrutinib prevents these cancer cells from signaling properly and ultimately leads to their death.  This targeted action minimizes damage to healthy cells, although side effects still occur.
