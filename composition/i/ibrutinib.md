# Ibrutinib
### Generic Name
Ibrutinib

### Usage
Ibrutinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat several types of blood cancers. Its main applications include:

*   **Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL):**  Ibrutinib is used in adults with MCL who have already received at least one other treatment.
*   **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) / small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL):** It's employed in adults with CLL or SLL, particularly those with a specific genetic abnormality called 17p deletion.
*   **Waldenström's macroglobulinemia:** Ibrutinib is a treatment option for adults with this rare blood cancer.
*   **Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL):** It's indicated for adults with MZL who need systemic therapy and have previously received at least one treatment with an anti-CD20-based therapy.
*   **Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD):** Ibrutinib is used to treat cGVHD in patients who haven't responded to other systemic therapies.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific cancer being treated and the patient's condition.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.  The medication is typically administered orally (as a capsule or tablet).  Dosage examples include:

*   **Mantle cell lymphoma and Marginal zone lymphoma:**  Often 560 mg once daily.
*   **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and chronic graft-versus-host disease:** Frequently 420 mg once daily.

Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on factors like liver function (reduced dosage for mild or moderate impairment, avoidance in severe impairment) and adverse reactions.  Specific adjustments are determined by a healthcare professional and outlined in the product information.  Children's use is not yet established.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

*   Fatigue
*   Dizziness
*   Headache
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Rash
*   Bruising
*   Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
*   Low white blood cell count (neutropenia)
*   Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
*   High blood pressure (hypertension)

Less common but more serious side effects include:  bleeding, serious infections, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), and second primary cancers.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.

### How it Works

Ibrutinib is a type of medication called a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. BTK is an enzyme crucial for the growth and survival of certain types of immune cells, including cancerous B-cells.  By blocking the activity of BTK, ibrutinib disrupts the signals that tell these cells to multiply, leading to their eventual death and slowing the progression of the cancer.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Ibrutinib is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
*   **Drug interactions:** Ibrutinib's metabolism can be affected by other medications.  Consult a healthcare provider about potential interactions, particularly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, as these can significantly alter ibrutinib's levels in the body.
*   **Specific populations:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using ibrutinib.  The drug's use in children is not established.  Careful monitoring is required for patients with kidney or liver problems.
*   **Increased risks:** Ibrutinib is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, infections, heart problems, and second primary malignancies.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take ibrutinib with food?** A: Ibrutinib can generally be taken with or without food.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.
*   **Q: How should I store ibrutinib?** A: Store ibrutinib as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
*   **Q: Are there any foods or drinks I should avoid while taking ibrutinib?** A: Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, as they can interact with the drug.
