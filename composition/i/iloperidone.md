# Iloperidone
### Generic Name
Iloperidone

### Usage

Iloperidone is primarily used for the acute treatment of schizophrenia in adults.  It's an atypical antipsychotic, meaning it works differently than older antipsychotic medications, often causing fewer movement-related side effects. While not approved for other conditions, its mechanism of action suggests potential benefits in other psychotic disorders, but this should only be considered under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adults (Schizophrenia):** Iloperidone is administered orally, typically starting at 1 mg twice daily (BID).  The dosage is carefully increased (titrated) over time, with increments not exceeding 2 mg BID every 24 hours, to reach a target range of 6-12 mg BID (12-24 mg/day). The maximum recommended dose is 24 mg/day.  The dosage needs to be adjusted based on individual response and tolerance.  When restarting treatment after a break of more than 3 days, the initial titration schedule should be followed.  

**Children and Adolescents:** The safety and effectiveness of iloperidone in children and adolescents have not been established. It should not be used in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function, and interactions with other medications.  Patients with mild hepatic impairment generally don't require dosage adjustments, but moderate impairment may necessitate caution and potential dose reduction. Severe hepatic impairment contraindicates iloperidone use.  Renal impairment alone is unlikely to significantly affect iloperidone pharmacokinetics, but caution is still advised.  If iloperidone is used concurrently with strong CYP2D6 (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin), the iloperidone dose should be halved. Similarly, individuals identified as poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 also require a dose reduction by half.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Increased serum prolactin levels
* Weight gain

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (1-10% or less frequent):**

* Fatigue
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) â€“ movement disorders like muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness.
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Palpitations
* Nasal congestion
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Dry mouth
* Diarrhea
* Blurred vision
* Sexual dysfunction (e.g., ejaculation failure, erectile dysfunction)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, is a possibility.  Other serious, though less common, side effects include QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm), and hypersensitivity reactions.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Iloperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that works by affecting multiple neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. It primarily acts as an antagonist (blocker) of serotonin 5-HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors. By blocking these receptors, iloperidone helps regulate neurotransmitter activity, which is believed to improve the symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.  The balance of serotonin and dopamine antagonism is thought to contribute to its efficacy and a reduced risk of certain side effects compared to older antipsychotics.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Iloperidone is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to iloperidone or its components. It's also contraindicated in patients with dementia-related psychosis.
* **Warnings:** There's a boxed warning regarding increased mortality risk in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis; iloperidone should not be used in this population.  Other warnings include risks for suicidal thoughts and behavior, orthostatic hypotension, neuroleptic malignant syndrome,  hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin levels), blood disorders (leukopenia, neutropenia), metabolic changes (hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, weight gain), QT prolongation, tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements), falls, and hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Interactions:** Iloperidone can interact with many medications, including other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and medications affecting the liver enzymes that metabolize it (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4).  Consult a healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:** Caution is necessary in elderly patients, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, liver or kidney impairment, diabetes, seizures, or those taking other medications that may increase the risk of falls or other adverse effects.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration of risks and benefits.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking iloperidone?** A:  No, you should avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how iloperidone affects you, as drowsiness and dizziness are common side effects.

* **Q: How should I store iloperidone?** A: Store iloperidone at room temperature, away from moisture and light, as directed on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking iloperidone suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking iloperidone suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience serious side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe allergic reactions, or unusual changes in your mental state.  Contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible for any concerning side effect.
