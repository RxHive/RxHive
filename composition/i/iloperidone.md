# Iloperidone

**Generic Name:** Iloperidone

**Usage:** Iloperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes).  It's also sometimes used to treat the depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, though this is less common.  It's prescribed by a psychiatrist or other qualified healthcare professional and should only be used under their supervision.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, iloperidone can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* **Movement disorders:**  These can range from restlessness and muscle stiffness (extrapyramidal symptoms) to more serious conditions like tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the face, mouth, and tongue).
* **Weight gain:**  Significant weight gain is a possibility.
* **Sedation/drowsiness:**  This can be particularly pronounced initially.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, which can lead to dizziness or fainting.
* **Prolonged QT interval:** This can potentially lead to irregular heartbeats.  ECG monitoring may be necessary, particularly in patients at risk.
* **Increased prolactin levels:** This can lead to menstrual irregularities in women and breast enlargement or milk production in both men and women.
* **Metabolic changes:** Increases in blood sugar and cholesterol levels.
* **Constipation:**  This is relatively common.
* **Dry mouth:** Another frequently reported side effect.
* **Blurred vision:**  Can occur in some individuals.

This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  It is crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Iloperidone works primarily by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with positive symptoms of psychosis (e.g., hallucinations and delusions), while serotonin plays a role in mood regulation and other cognitive functions. By blocking these receptors, iloperidone helps to reduce psychotic symptoms and improve mood stability.  The exact mechanisms by which it achieves this are still being researched.

**FAQs:**

* **Is iloperidone addictive?**  Iloperidone is not physically addictive in the same way as opioids or stimulants, but stopping abruptly after long-term use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  It's crucial to work with a doctor to gradually taper off the medication if discontinuation is necessary.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking iloperidone?**  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking iloperidone, as it can increase the risk of sedation and other side effects.  A doctor can provide specific advice based on individual circumstances.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Can iloperidone cause drowsiness that affects driving ability?**  Yes, drowsiness is a potential side effect.  Do not drive or operate machinery until you know how iloperidone affects you.

* **Who shouldn't take iloperidone?**  People with known hypersensitivity to iloperidone or its components should not take it.  Individuals with certain heart conditions, particularly those with a prolonged QT interval, should also use caution.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor.
