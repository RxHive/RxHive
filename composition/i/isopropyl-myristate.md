# Isopropyl myristate
### Generic Name
Isopropyl Myristate

### Usage
Isopropyl myristate is a pediculicide, meaning it's used to kill head lice.  It's specifically indicated for treating head lice infestations in adults and children aged 4 years and older.  This medication works by targeting the lice directly, not the nits (lice eggs).  While it primarily treats head lice, it doesn't address other conditions.

### Dosage
**Head Lice Infestation (Topical Application):**

The dosage is based on hair length and requires two applications, one on day 1 and another on day 7.  A 50% solution of isopropyl myristate is typically used.

* **Adults and Children >4 years:**
    * **Short Hair:** 30-60 mL per application (total treatment: 60-120 mL)
    * **Shoulder-Length Hair:** 60-90 mL per application (total treatment: 120-180 mL)
    * **Long Hair:** 90-120 mL per application (total treatment: 180-240 mL)

**Administration:**  Apply to dry hair, massaging thoroughly until the scalp and neck are wet. Leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing with warm water. A fine-toothed comb can be used after rinsing to remove any remaining lice or nits.

### Side Effects
* Rash
* Contact dermatitis

While rare, any unusual skin reactions should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Isopropyl myristate works by dissolving the waxy outer layer (cuticle) of the lice.  This disrupts their ability to retain water, leading to dehydration, immobility, and ultimately, death.  It's important to note that it primarily affects the adult lice and may require additional measures to remove nits.

### Precautions
* **Contraindication:**  Do not use isopropyl myristate if you have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to isopropyl myristate or any other component of the formulation.
* **General Precautions:**
    * For external use only. Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, flush immediately with plenty of water.
    * The product can make surfaces slippery. Exercise caution when applying to avoid falls.
    * Isopropyl myristate may stain fabrics. Protect clothing and upholstery with a towel.
    * Thoroughly inspect all family members for lice daily between treatments and for at least two weeks after the final treatment to prevent re-infestation.  

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  While the lice begin to die within minutes of application, a second application after seven days is necessary to ensure the elimination of any surviving lice or newly hatched ones from eggs that may have been present at the time of the initial treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular dosing schedule.

* **Q: Can I use this product on infants or young children?** A: This product is not recommended for children under 4 years old. Always consult a healthcare professional for dosage and safety information for children.

* **Q: How should I store Isopropyl Myristate?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any unusual skin reactions or other adverse effects, discontinue use and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
