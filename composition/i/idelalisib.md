# Idelalisib
### Generic Name
Idelalisib

### Usage

Idelalisib is a targeted therapy used to treat specific types of relapsed blood cancers.  It's primarily indicated for:

* **Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):**  Idelalisib is used in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsed CLL where rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy, usually due to the presence of other health conditions. It's important to note that idelalisib is *not* recommended as a first-line treatment for CLL.

* **Relapsed Follicular B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (FL):** Idelalisib is an option for patients whose FL has returned after at least two other systemic therapies have been tried.

* **Relapsed Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL):** Similar to FL, idelalisib is used in patients with relapsed SLL who haven't responded adequately to at least two previous systemic treatments.

It is crucial to understand that idelalisib is not a first-line treatment for these cancers and is only used after other therapies have been attempted.  The decision to use idelalisib should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who can assess the patient's individual circumstances.


### Dosage

Idelalisib is administered orally (by mouth) as a tablet.  The typical dosage is 150 mg twice daily (BID).  

* **Adults with relapsed CLL:** 150 mg BID in combination with rituximab.
* **Adults with relapsed FL or SLL:** 150 mg BID.

Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The dosage may need to be adjusted based on various factors, including liver and kidney function, and the severity of side effects.  Specific adjustments are detailed in the prescribing information and should only be made under the direction of a healthcare professional.  These adjustments often involve temporarily interrupting treatment, reducing the dose (e.g., to 100mg BID), or stopping treatment altogether depending on the severity and nature of the side effects.  For example, severe hepatotoxicity or diarrhea may require dose reduction or discontinuation.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of idelalisib in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Idelalisib can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Skin rash
* Night sweats
* Decreased hemoglobin levels
* Decreased platelet count
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST)
* Infections (including serious infections like sepsis)
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Fever
* Asthenia (weakness)

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Intestinal perforation
* Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a life-threatening skin reaction)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) a rare brain infection.


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Idelalisib is a kinase inhibitor that specifically targets PI3K-delta, an enzyme crucial for the growth and survival of certain types of B cells (a type of white blood cell).  By blocking the activity of PI3K-delta, idelalisib helps to induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in malignant B cells, thereby reducing the number of cancer cells.  It also interferes with several signaling pathways involved in the development and progression of CLL, FL, and SLL.



### Precautions

* **Hepatotoxicity:** Idelalisib can cause serious liver damage. Liver function tests are regularly monitored during treatment.
* **Diarrhea/Colitis:** Severe diarrhea and colitis (inflammation of the colon) are significant risks.
* **Infections:** Idelalisib weakens the immune system, increasing the risk of serious infections.
* **Pneumonitis:** Inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis) can occur.
* **Intestinal Perforation:** This serious complication can develop.
* **Skin Reactions:** Severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are possible.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Serious allergic reactions can occur.
* **Drug Interactions:** Idelalisib interacts with certain medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Idelalisib is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to certain side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Idelalisib with food?** A: Yes, Idelalisib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If less than 6 hours have passed since the missed dose, take it as soon as you remember. If more than 6 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Idelalisib?** A: Store Idelalisib at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of Idelalisib?** A: The long-term effects of idelalisib are not fully known, but regular monitoring is necessary to detect and manage potential complications.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Idelalisib?** A: It is generally recommended to avoid alcohol while on this medication, as it can increase the risk of liver damage and other side effects.  Always consult your doctor about alcohol consumption during treatment.
