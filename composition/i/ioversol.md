# Ioversol
### Generic Name
Ioversol

### Usage
Ioversol is an iodinated contrast medium used in various diagnostic imaging procedures. Its primary purpose is to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and organs during medical imaging, allowing healthcare professionals to better visualize internal structures.  Specific uses include:

*   **Angiography:**  Visualizing blood vessels, including peripheral arteries (arteriography), coronary arteries (coronary arteriography), and veins (venography).  This helps diagnose conditions like blockages, aneurysms, and vascular malformations.
*   **Computed Tomography (CT):** Enhancing the contrast in CT scans of the head and body. This improves the visualization of organs, tissues, and blood vessels, aiding in the diagnosis of various conditions.
*   **Excretory Urography:** Examining the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. This helps detect abnormalities like kidney stones, obstructions, and infections.
*   **Digital Subtraction Angiography:** A specialized technique used to highlight blood vessels by subtracting a pre-contrast image from a post-contrast image.

### Dosage
Ioversol dosage is highly variable and depends on several factors, including the type of imaging procedure, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation used.  **It's crucial to consult the product information for precise dosing instructions.**  There are no standardized adult or pediatric doses that can be provided here.  Dosage is determined by the radiologist or physician based on individual patient needs and the specific imaging technique.

### Side Effects
Ioversol, like other contrast media, can cause side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Nausea
*   Fever

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Vertigo
*   Drowsiness
*   Visual disturbances
*   Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
*   Cardiac complications (changes in blood pressure, heart rhythm)
*   Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
*   Acute kidney injury (rare but potentially serious)

**Other potential side effects (reported less frequently):**  The list is extensive and includes various symptoms affecting many body systems; refer to the detailed prescribing information for a complete list.  If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ioversol is an iodinated contrast agent, meaning it contains iodine atoms.  Iodine is radiopaque, which means it absorbs X-rays more effectively than surrounding tissues. When Ioversol is injected into the bloodstream or administered via other routes, it increases the density of the blood vessels or organs it passes through. This improved contrast allows for clearer visualization of these structures on X-ray images, CT scans, and other imaging modalities.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Ioversol is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic hyperthyroidism.
*   **Increased Risk:** Patients with certain conditions, such as severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, multiple myeloma, myasthenia gravis, history of contrast media reaction, pheochromocytoma, sickle cell disease, and those undergoing procedures that increase the risk of thrombus formation are at increased risk for adverse events.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Ioversol may interact with certain medications.  Consult your physician or pharmacist about any medications you are currently taking. Notably, concurrent use of aldesleukin and metformin increases the risk of adverse events.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ioversol crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Use during pregnancy should be restricted to situations where the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Breastfeeding is generally considered acceptable after Ioversol administration.
*   **Hydration:** Adequate hydration before and after Ioversol administration is crucial, especially to mitigate the risk of kidney problems.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for Ioversol to leave my body?** A: Ioversol is primarily excreted by the kidneys. The elimination time varies depending on renal function but usually occurs within a few hours to a day.
*   **Q: Are there any allergies I should be aware of?** A:  Prior hypersensitivity reactions to iodine-containing contrast agents are a major concern. Inform your doctor about any allergies, especially allergies to iodine or shellfish.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly severe allergic reactions or kidney problems.
*   **Q: How is Ioversol stored?** A:  Store Ioversol according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
