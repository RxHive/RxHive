# Ipecacuanha
### Generic Name
Ipecacuanha (Ipecac)

### Usage
Ipecacuanha, derived from the *Carapichea ipecacuanha* plant, is primarily used to induce vomiting in cases of acute oral drug overdose or poisoning.  Its emetic effect is due to the alkaloids emetine and cephaeline.  This action helps to remove the ingested substance from the body, reducing its potential harmful effects. However, its use is becoming less common due to the availability of more effective and safer methods of managing poisoning.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Emesis Induction):**

*   **Oral Syrup:** 15-30 mL followed by 200-300 mL of water.  A second dose may be given if vomiting doesn't occur within 20 minutes, but if vomiting still hasn't occurred within 30 minutes of the second dose,  gastric lavage (stomach pumping) should be performed.

**Pediatric Dosage (Emesis Induction):**

*   **Ages 6-12 months:** 5-10 mL of syrup followed by 10-20 mL/kg of water.  A second dose may be given if vomiting doesn't occur within 20 minutes, but if vomiting still hasn't occurred within 30 minutes of the second dose, gastric lavage should be performed.
*   **Ages 1-12 years:** 15 mL of syrup followed by 10-20 mL/kg of water. A second dose may be given if vomiting doesn't occur within 20 minutes, but if vomiting still hasn't occurred within 30 minutes of the second dose, gastric lavage should be performed.
*   **Ages >12 years:**  Same as adult dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The safety and efficacy of ipecac in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not established.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

*   Protracted vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Lethargy

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Aspiration (inhaling vomit into the lungs)
*   Vagal bradycardia (slow heart rate)
*   CNS depression (reduced brain function)
*   Pneumomediastinum (air in the chest cavity)
*   Mallory-Weiss tear (tear in the lining of the esophagus)
*   Myopathy (muscle disease)

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Ipecacuanha works through a dual mechanism:  It stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla (the brainstem) which triggers the vomiting reflex, and it also directly irritates the gastric mucosa (stomach lining), causing nausea and vomiting.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ipecacuanha is contraindicated in the following situations:

*   Rapid deterioration of the patient's condition.
*   Ingestion of corrosive substances, volatile liquids, or sharp objects.
*   A short time interval between ingestion of the poison and the administration of charcoal or lavage.
*   Ingestion of a substance that alters mental status, compromises airway protective reflexes, or causes seizures.
*   Severe intoxication (alcohol or drugs).
*   Severe lethargy or unconsciousness.
*   Shock or coma.
*   Seizure activity.
*   Absence of a gag reflex.

**Warnings:**  Increased risk of protracted vomiting, diarrhea, CNS adverse effects (lethargy, irritability, hyperactivity), and cardiovascular adverse effects (heart problems) exists.

**Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal disorders, eating disorders, cardiovascular disorders, after acute cardiac glycoside overdose, and in cases of spontaneous vomiting.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration.

**Drug Interactions:** Activated charcoal can bind to ipecac, reducing its effectiveness; therefore, concurrent use is generally not recommended.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I use ipecacuanha at home?** A:  No.  Ipecacuanha should only be used under the direct supervision of a medical professional.  Modern treatment of poisoning often involves other methods like activated charcoal or gastric lavage.

*   **Q: How should I store ipecacuanha?** A: Store in a cool, dry place away from children.

*   **Q: Is ipecacuanha safe for everyone?** A:  No.  It has contraindications and potential side effects and should only be used under medical supervision.

*   **Q: Is ipecacuanha still commonly used?** A:  Its use is declining due to the availability of safer and more effective methods for managing poisoning.  It is rarely the first-line treatment choice.

*   **Q:  What should I do if I suspect poisoning?** A:  Immediately contact a poison control center or emergency services.  Do not attempt self-treatment.
