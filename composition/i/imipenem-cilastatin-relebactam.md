# Imipenem + Cilastatin + Relebactam
### Generic Name
Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam

### Usage

Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in adults (18 years and older) when other treatment options are limited or ineffective.  Its primary use is in treating complicated infections, meaning those that are difficult to treat due to their location or severity, or because the bacteria causing them are resistant to other antibiotics. These infections include:

* **Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI):** Infections within the abdominal cavity, often following surgery or injury.
* **Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis:** Infections affecting the kidneys (pyelonephritis) and/or urinary tract.
* **Hospital-Acquired or Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (HAP/VAP):** Pneumonia acquired during a hospital stay, often linked to mechanical ventilation.

This combination is specifically effective against certain gram-negative bacteria that produce beta-lactamases, enzymes that can break down many common antibiotics, including imipenem. Relebactam, a component of this combination, inhibits these beta-lactamases, enhancing the effectiveness of imipenem.

### Dosage

The standard adult dose of Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam is 1.25g (Imipenem 500mg, Cilastatin 500mg, Relebactam 250mg) administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 6 hours. The duration of treatment typically ranges from 4 to 14 days depending on the infection's severity and response to therapy.

**Dosage Adjustments based on Renal Function:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (reduced creatinine clearance, CrCl).  The recommended adjustments are:

* CrCl â‰¥ 90 mL/min: No adjustment needed.
* CrCl 60-89 mL/min: 1g every 6 hours.
* CrCl 30-59 mL/min: 750mg every 6 hours.
* CrCl 15-29 mL/min: 500mg every 6 hours.
* CrCl < 15 mL/min:  Generally not recommended unless hemodialysis is initiated within 48 hours.  If on hemodialysis, 500mg every 6 hours after dialysis.
* Peritoneal dialysis:  Not recommended.

**Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not typically needed for patients with liver impairment, although monitoring is advisable.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam in children under 18 years of age haven't been established.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (AST and ALT)
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Infusion-site pain
* Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDAD), causing severe diarrhea.
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).
* Central nervous system (CNS) effects, such as seizures or confusion.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Imipenem is a carbapenem antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  This disrupts the bacteria's structure, ultimately leading to their death.  Cilastatin protects imipenem from breakdown in the kidneys, ensuring that sufficient amounts reach the bloodstream to fight the infection. Relebactam inhibits certain beta-lactamases, enzymes that many bacteria produce to resist the effects of carbapenem antibiotics like imipenem. By preventing this breakdown, Relebactam allows Imipenem to remain effective against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to imipenem, cilastatin, relebactum, or any of the formulation's components.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Careful dose adjustment is crucial for patients with kidney problems.  Monitor renal function regularly.
* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Disorders:** Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures or other CNS disorders.  The risk of CNS side effects is increased in these patients.
* **Superinfections:**  Like other antibiotics, Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam can cause the overgrowth of other microorganisms, leading to superinfections. Monitor for signs of fungal or bacterial superinfections.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this drug during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established.  Use with caution and only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult with your doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication may interact with other drugs; informing your doctor about all medications you take is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam?**  A: Store as directed by your pharmacist. Usually, this involves refrigeration.  Refer to the product label for specific instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication once I feel better?**  A: No, continue the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to recurrent infection and antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately, especially if you experience severe side effects, such as severe allergic reactions or seizures.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for everyone?** A: No. Certain groups, such as pregnant women, people with kidney problems, and those with CNS disorders, require special precautions and dose adjustments. Always discuss your medical history with your doctor before taking this or any medication.
