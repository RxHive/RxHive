* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  To reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe RA in adults who haven't responded well to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
* **Psoriatic arthritis:** To reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis in adults.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** To reduce the signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis in adults.
* **Psoriasis:** To treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who haven't responded to other treatments.
* **Crohn's disease:** To treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease in adults.
* **Ulcerative colitis:** To treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in adults.
* **Hidradenitis suppurativa:** To treat moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in adults.
* **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA):**  Used in combination with other medications.

**Important Note:**  The specific usage and dosage will be determined by a doctor based on the individual patient's condition and response to treatment.


**Side Effects:**

Infliximab-dyyb, like other TNF blockers, can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe. Some common side effects include:

* **Infections:** Increased risk of infections (respiratory, skin, etc.) due to immunosuppression.
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site.

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* **Serious infections (including tuberculosis, opportunistic infections):**  Requires careful monitoring and pre-treatment screening.
* **Heart failure:** Worsening of existing heart failure or development of new heart failure.
* **Blood disorders:** Decreased blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia).
* **Nervous system disorders:**  Numbness, tingling, dizziness, multiple sclerosis exacerbation.
* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are possible.
* **Malignancies (cancers):**  Increased risk of certain cancers, particularly lymphoma.


This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult a healthcare professional for a complete list of potential side effects and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:**

Infliximab-dyyb works by blocking the action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a protein involved in inflammation.  By blocking TNF-α, it reduces inflammation and helps alleviate the symptoms of autoimmune diseases.  It doesn't cure the underlying disease but helps manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
