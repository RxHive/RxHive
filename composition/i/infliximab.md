# Infliximab
### Generic Name
Infliximab

### Usage
Infliximab is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.  Specifically, it targets and neutralizes TNF-alpha, a protein involved in inflammation.  Its primary use is in treating various autoimmune diseases characterized by excessive inflammation.  These include:

* **Crohn's disease:**  A chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting the digestive tract. Infliximab helps reduce inflammation and improve symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.
* **Ulcerative colitis:** Another chronic inflammatory bowel disease primarily affecting the large intestine.  Infliximab works similarly to how it works in Crohn's disease, reducing inflammation and improving symptoms.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints. Infliximab is often used in combination with methotrexate to reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** A type of inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine. Infliximab helps manage pain and stiffness associated with this condition.
* **Psoriatic arthritis:**  Arthritis associated with psoriasis, a skin condition. Infliximab helps control both the joint inflammation and skin symptoms.
* **Plaque psoriasis:** A chronic skin condition causing raised, red, scaly patches on the skin. Infliximab can significantly improve these skin lesions.

In addition to these primary uses, Infliximab may be used off-label in other conditions, including pustular psoriasis and Takayasu arteritis, but its efficacy and safety in these uses need further investigation.  Always discuss any off-label uses with your healthcare provider.


### Dosage

Infliximab is administered intravenously (IV) and dosage varies widely depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's weight, and their response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the precise instructions given by your doctor or healthcare provider.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not substitute for personalized medical advice.

**Adults:**  Dosage regimens typically involve an initial loading dose followed by maintenance infusions at intervals of several weeks.  Specific dosages for various conditions are outlined below, but it's important to note that these are examples and your doctor will determine the right dose for you.

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:**  Usually starts with 3 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks.  Higher doses and more frequent infusions may be used if needed.
* **Crohn's Disease & Ulcerative Colitis:** Often begins with 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks.  Dose adjustments may be made based on response.
* **Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Plaque Psoriasis:**  Similar to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, often starting with 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, with subsequent maintenance infusions.

**Children:** The use of Infliximab in children varies greatly depending on the specific condition and the child's age and weight.  Consult your pediatrician or a specialist for precise pediatric dosing.  Off-label use in conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis is also possible, requiring careful medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function. Your doctor will assess this and modify the dosage as needed.



### Side Effects

Infliximab, like many medications, can cause side effects.  These range from mild to severe, and the likelihood and severity vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Infection (upper respiratory tract infections are common)
* Infusion-related reactions (e.g., flushing, itching, rash)
* Fatigue


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Heart problems
* Liver damage
* Blood disorders (e.g., low white blood cell count)
* Increased risk of infections (including tuberculosis reactivation)
* Certain types of cancer (lymphoma)
* Neurological problems (e.g., demyelinating diseases)

It's crucial to report any side effects to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.  Prompt attention to adverse effects can help prevent serious complications.



### How it Works

Infliximab works by binding to and neutralizing TNF-alpha.  TNF-alpha is a protein that plays a crucial role in inflammation.  By blocking TNF-alpha, Infliximab reduces the inflammatory response in the body, thereby alleviating symptoms of autoimmune diseases.  This process helps reduce joint swelling and pain in arthritis, calms the inflammation in the intestines for inflammatory bowel disease, and reduces skin inflammation in psoriasis.



### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Infliximab is contraindicated in individuals with known severe hypersensitivity to Infliximab, murine proteins, or any of its components.
* **Infections:**  Infliximab increases the risk of infections, including serious ones.  Individuals with active infections or a weakened immune system should generally not use this medication.  Tuberculosis screening is essential before and during treatment.
* **Heart Failure:**  Infliximab should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of Infliximab during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and consultation with your doctor.
* **Other Medications:**  Infliximab can interact with other medications, especially other immunosuppressants.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Immunizations:**  Live vaccines should generally be avoided while taking Infliximab.


### FAQs

* **How long does it take to see results?**  The time it takes to see improvements varies widely depending on the condition and individual response. Some people experience improvements within weeks, while others may need longer.
* **How long is the treatment?**  Treatment duration is determined by your doctor and depends on your response and the severity of your condition.
* **Can I stop taking Infliximab suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking Infliximab abruptly.  Stopping the medication must be done gradually under the guidance of your healthcare provider to prevent potential complications.
* **How is Infliximab stored?**  Store Infliximab according to the instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a scheduled infusion.  Do not try to make up a missed dose on your own.
