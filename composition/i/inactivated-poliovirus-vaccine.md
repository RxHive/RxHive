# Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine
### Generic Name
Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV)

### Usage
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is a highly effective vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio), a debilitating and potentially fatal infectious disease caused by poliovirus.  Poliovirus attacks the nervous system, potentially leading to paralysis. IPV protects against all three serotypes (types 1, 2, and 3) of the poliovirus.  While its primary use is the prevention of polio, it plays a crucial role in global polio eradication efforts.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage and schedule depend on prior vaccination history.

* **Previously unvaccinated adults:**  A series of three 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injections.  The first two doses are given 1-2 months apart, followed by a third dose 6-12 months later.  Shorter intervals may be necessary in certain situations, as determined by a healthcare professional.
* **Incompletely vaccinated adults:** At least one 0.5 mL dose of IPV is recommended, with additional doses to complete the series as needed and feasible, depending on their prior vaccination history.
* **Completely vaccinated adults at increased risk of exposure:** A single 0.5 mL dose is typically sufficient.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Primary immunization (infants and children 6 weeks to 47 months):**  A series of three 0.5 mL doses administered at 2, 4, and 6-18 months of age (IM or SubQ).
* **Booster immunization (children 4-6 years):** A single 0.5 mL dose (IM or SubQ), given at least 6 months after the previous dose.
* **Catch-up immunization (4 months to 18 years):**  The number of doses required will vary depending on the child's vaccination history, determined by a healthcare provider.  Each dose is 0.5 mL (IM or SubQ).


**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to current manufacturer labeling.  However, it's crucial to consult a doctor for individuals with impaired organ function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Irritability (most common in infants under 2 months)
* Fatigue
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Tenderness at the injection site
* Swelling at the injection site


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Excessive crying (within 72 hours)
* Vomiting
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Fever (temperature >39Â°C)


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Agitation
* Anaphylactic shock
* Anaphylaxis
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Drowsiness
* Febrile seizures
* Headache
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Seizures
* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)

Any unusual or concerning side effect warrants immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

IPV contains inactivated (killed) polioviruses.  When administered, the vaccine introduces these harmless viruses to the body. The body's immune system recognizes these viruses as foreign invaders and mounts an immune response, producing antibodies against them.  These antibodies provide long-lasting protection against future poliovirus infections.  The vaccine doesn't cause polio.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** IPV is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine (e.g., 2-phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B), anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock within 24 hours of a previous dose, or an acute febrile illness (excluding minor illness with or without low-grade fever).
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions and syncope (fainting).
* **Use with caution:** In patients with bleeding disorders or those receiving anticoagulant therapy.  IM injection should be performed with caution in such individuals; SubQ administration may be considered.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Vaccination of pregnant women should generally be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks.  IPV does not affect the safety of breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:** The effectiveness of IPV may be reduced by certain medications, such as immunosuppressants. Discuss all medications with a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I get polio from the IPV vaccine?** A: No. The IPV vaccine contains inactivated (killed) viruses and cannot cause polio.

* **Q: How long does the protection from IPV last?** A:  IPV provides long-lasting protection, often for many years, although booster doses may be recommended depending on individual circumstances and public health recommendations.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a serious side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.  Generally, vaccines should be refrigerated.

* **Q: Can I receive other vaccines at the same time as IPV?** A:  Consult a healthcare provider; simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines is often possible but depends on the specific vaccines involved.

* **Q: What if I missed a dose?** A: Consult a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate next step.  The recommended schedule should be followed as closely as possible.
