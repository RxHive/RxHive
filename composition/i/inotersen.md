# Inotersen
### Generic Name
Inotersen

### Usage
Inotersen is a medication used to treat the polyneuropathy (nerve damage) associated with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adults.  hATTR amyloidosis is a rare, inherited disorder where an abnormal protein, transthyretin (TTR), builds up in various organs, including nerves, heart, and kidneys, causing damage. Inotersen's primary function is to target and reduce the levels of this abnormal TTR protein, thus slowing down or preventing disease progression.  While primarily used for polyneuropathy in hATTR, research is ongoing to explore its potential in treating other manifestations of this condition.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage for the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis is 284 mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once weekly.  The medication is provided in pre-filled syringes.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on factors such as:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild hepatic (liver) impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed. For those with moderate to severe impairment, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific adjustments; close monitoring is crucial.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher require no dosage adjustment.  For those with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², manufacturer's labeling does not offer adjustments.  Treatment may need to be temporarily or permanently stopped based on kidney function monitoring (see Precautions).
* **Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count):**  Dosage adjustments or treatment discontinuation are based on platelet count levels (see Precautions for details).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Inotersen in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Chills
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
* Presyncope (feeling faint)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Anemia
* Antibody development
* Injection site reaction
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Renal insufficiency (reduced kidney function)
* Fever

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Stroke
* Vitamin A deficiency
* Hypersensitivity reactions


**Important:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.

### How it Works
Inotersen is an antisense oligonucleotide. This means it's a small molecule designed to bind to specific messenger RNA (mRNA). In the case of Inotersen, it targets the mRNA that produces the abnormal transthyretin (TTR) protein responsible for hATTR amyloidosis. By binding to the mRNA, Inotersen triggers its degradation, reducing the production of the faulty TTR protein. This, in turn, lowers the levels of the abnormal protein in the blood and tissues, slowing down the disease's progression and reducing damage to organs.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Inotersen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components, a history of Inotersen-induced acute glomerulonephritis, or a platelet count below 100,000/mm³.  Use caution in patients with impaired kidney or liver function, or those taking other nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic medications, or those using antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies.

* **Thrombocytopenia and Glomerulonephritis:** Inotersen carries a significant risk of severe thrombocytopenia (dangerously low platelet counts) and glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation).  Regular monitoring of platelet counts and kidney function is essential (see Dosage Adjustments).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Effective contraception is necessary for both men and women of reproductive age during treatment. Inotersen can lower vitamin A levels, crucial for fetal development.  The safety of Inotersen during breastfeeding is unknown.

* **Drug Interactions:** Inotersen might enhance the effects of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications.  Close monitoring is necessary if these medications are used concurrently.

* **Other Warnings:** Monitor for signs of liver transplant rejection (in patients with a liver transplant history).


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Inotersen administered?** A: Inotersen is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once weekly.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies among patients.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible. If the next dose is within 2 days, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular schedule.

* **Q: How should I store Inotersen?** A:  Refer to the medication packaging for specific storage instructions.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A: Vitamin A supplementation may be recommended during treatment.

* **Q:  Can Inotersen be used in children?** A: No, the safety and efficacy of Inotersen in children have not been established.
