# Indium (In 111) Oxyquinoline
### Generic Name
Indium (In 111) Oxyquinoline

### Usage
Indium (In 111) oxyquinoline is a radiopharmaceutical used to label white blood cells (leukocytes).  These labeled leukocytes are then injected back into the patient.  The primary use is as an adjunct in detecting inflammatory sites, such as abscesses or infections, where other imaging techniques (ultrasound, CT scan) are inconclusive or ambiguous.  It essentially helps pinpoint the location of infection by tracking the migration of the labeled white blood cells, which naturally accumulate in areas of inflammation.  This is particularly useful when other diagnostic methods haven't provided a clear picture.


### Dosage
**Diagnostic Imaging (Adults):** The dosage is administered intravenously (IV).  A typical dose for a 70kg patient ranges from 200-500 microCi (7.4-18.5 MBq). The exact dose is determined by a radioactivity calibration system immediately before administration. Imaging is usually performed approximately 24 hours post-injection, typically including anterior and posterior views of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, with additional views as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Indium (In 111) oxyquinoline in children under 18 years of age have not been established.


### Side Effects
* Urticaria (hives)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Fever

While less common, serious side effects can occur.  It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Indium (In 111) oxyquinoline is used to label a patient's own white blood cells (autologous leukocytes).  This labeling makes the cells detectable using a special imaging technique (usually gamma camera).  When injected back into the patient, these labeled leukocytes migrate to sites of inflammation, such as infections or abscesses. By imaging the labeled cells, healthcare professionals can pinpoint the location and extent of the inflammation, aiding in diagnosis.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Indium (In 111) oxyquinoline is categorized as pregnancy Category C.  Radiation exposure from this radiopharmaceutical poses a potential risk to the developing fetus. It should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Elective examinations in women of reproductive potential should ideally be scheduled within 10 days of the onset of menses. The manufacturer recommends that breastfeeding be stopped temporarily until radioactivity clears from the breast milk.
* **Leukopenia:**  Patients with low white blood cell counts (leukopenia) should use caution as the procedure requires a sufficient number of leukocytes to label.
* **Handling and Disposal:**  Special precautions are necessary for handling and disposing of this radioactive material to minimize exposure to patients and healthcare personnel.  This must be done under the supervision of trained professionals.
* **Cell Handling:** Aseptic techniques are crucial throughout the process to prevent contamination and infection.  Prompt administration (ideally within 1 hour, but no later than 3 hours after labeling, and within 5 hours of initial blood draw) is necessary to maintain the viability and chemotactic ability of leukocytes. Contamination of the leukocyte preparation with plasma or red blood cells can significantly reduce the efficiency of the labeling process.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to get the results?**  A: Imaging is typically performed about 24 hours after the injection of the labeled leukocytes.

* **Q: Is this procedure painful?** A: The injection itself is usually only mildly uncomfortable, similar to a routine blood draw.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: The primary concern is the radiation exposure, but the quantity of radiation used is carefully controlled to minimize risks.  Potential long-term effects are rare but should be discussed with the healthcare provider.

* **Q: What if I have an allergic reaction?** A: Allergic reactions are possible, though rare.  Healthcare professionals are prepared to manage any allergic reactions that might occur.
