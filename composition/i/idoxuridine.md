# Idoxuridine
### Generic Name
Idoxuridine

### Usage
Idoxuridine is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat herpes simplex keratitis (herpes infection of the cornea, the clear front part of the eye) and cutaneous herpes simplex and herpes zoster (herpes infections of the skin).  It's important to note that idoxuridine is not effective against all types of viral infections.  Its use is specifically targeted at these herpes viral infections.

### Dosage

**Herpes simplex keratitis (Ophthalmic):**

* **Initial Dose:**  One drop (0.1%) into each affected eye every hour during the day and every two hours at night until improvement is observed.
* **Maintenance Dose:** One drop (0.1%) into each affected eye every two hours during the day and every four hours at night.
* **Treatment Duration:** Continue for 5-7 days after the infection appears healed, but treatment should not exceed 21 days.

**Cutaneous herpes simplex and herpes zoster (Topical):**

* **Dosage:** Apply 5% cream to the affected skin lesions four times daily for four days.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of idoxuridine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Safety and efficacy in these patient populations are not established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Burning sensation
* Dermatitis (skin inflammation)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Erythema (redness)
* Eye irritation

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer - very rare)
* Leukoplakia (white patches in the mouth)
* Bacterial infections (secondary infections)
* Diarrhea
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Glossitis (inflammation of the tongue)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Conjunctival scarring
* Visual loss
* Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Idoxuridine is a nucleoside analog. This means it's a synthetic substance similar to naturally occurring nucleosides (building blocks of DNA).  It works by interfering with the herpes virus's ability to replicate its DNA. Idoxuridine substitutes itself for thymidine, a crucial component of viral DNA, thus disrupting the virus's replication process and preventing its spread.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Idoxuridine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or those concurrently using corticosteroids (unless specifically instructed otherwise by their doctor).
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with deep corneal ulceration.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Idoxuridine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  This means that the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in certain situations, but the decision should be made in close consultation with a healthcare provider. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking, particularly other topical eye medications.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid long-term use.  Do not touch the dropper tip to any surface, including the eyes. Apply gentle pressure to the inner corner of the eye after instillation to minimize drainage.  Wear sunglasses to reduce light sensitivity. If you are using contact lenses, wait at least 15 minutes after applying this medication before inserting them.
