# Ipratropium (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Ipratropium (Nasal)

### Usage

Ipratropium nasal spray is an anticholinergic medication primarily used for the symptomatic relief of runny nose (rhinorrhea).  It's effective in managing rhinorrhea associated with several conditions, including:

* **Allergic and non-allergic perennial rhinitis:**  This refers to a year-round runny nose caused by allergies or other factors.
* **Seasonal allergic rhinitis:**  This is a runny nose related to seasonal allergies, such as hay fever.
* **Common cold:** Ipratropium can provide relief from the runny nose symptom during a common cold.

It's important to understand that ipratropium nasal spray only addresses the runny nose symptom; it does not treat other cold symptoms like congestion, sneezing, or postnasal drip.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the age of the patient, and the concentration of the nasal spray (0.03% or 0.06%).  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The following information is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Allergic/non-allergic perennial rhinitis (0.03% solution):** Two sprays in each nostril twice or three times daily (BID or TID).
* **Seasonal allergic rhinitis (0.06% solution):** Two sprays in each nostril four times daily (QID), but use beyond three weeks isn't established.
* **Common cold (0.06% solution):** Two sprays in each nostril three or four times daily (TID or QID), but use beyond four days isn't established.

**Children:**  Dosage for children varies significantly by age and the condition being treated.  Always consult a doctor for precise instructions for children.  Generally, lower dosages are used, and the duration of treatment is often shorter. For example, children aged 2-5 years might receive only one spray per nostril a few times daily for a limited duration in seasonal rhinitis or a cold.

**Administration:** Before the first use, prime the inhaler by spraying several times into the air.  If the inhaler hasn't been used for more than 24 hours, reprime it. Gently blow your nose to clear the nostrils before using the spray.  Avoid spraying into the eyes.

### How it Works

Ipratropium nasal spray works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates secretions from the glands in your nose. By inhibiting these secretions, it reduces the amount of runny nasal discharge.  This effect is localized to the nasal passages.


### Precautions
