# Isosorbide Mononitrate
### Generic Name
Isosorbide Mononitrate

### Usage
Isosorbide mononitrate is primarily used to treat and prevent angina pectoris (chest pain) caused by coronary artery disease.  It works by widening blood vessels, improving blood flow to the heart, and reducing the heart's workload, thus lessening chest pain.  It's also used off-label in combination with hydralazine for persistent heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in patients who haven't responded well to other treatments or can't tolerate them.  This off-label use requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release), the condition being treated, and the individual patient.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Angina (immediate-release):** Typically starts at 5 mg twice daily, 7 hours apart.  This can be increased to 10 mg twice daily, and eventually to a maintenance dose of 20 mg twice daily, 7 hours apart.

* **Angina (extended-release):** Usually begins at 25-60 mg once daily in the morning. The dose may be increased, but only after at least 3 days, up to a maximum of 240 mg daily.  Extended-release formulations are not for immediate relief of angina attacks.

* **Heart Failure (extended-release, off-label use):** The starting dose is usually 30-60 mg once daily in combination with hydralazine multiple times daily.  Dosage adjustments are made incrementally under close medical supervision.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of isosorbide mononitrate in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments are generally not needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, for those on hemodialysis, the dose should be given after the dialysis session.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Nausea
* Lightheadedness

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Allergic reactions

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or unusual ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Isosorbide mononitrate is a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes and widens blood vessels. This primarily affects the veins, causing blood to pool in the periphery and reducing the amount of blood returning to the heart (preload). This decreases the heart's workload.  It also dilates arteries, lowering blood pressure (afterload).  These combined effects reduce the heart's oxygen demand, relieving angina pain.  In heart failure, this mechanism helps reduce the strain on the heart.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Isosorbide mononitrate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to nitrates or nitrites, concurrent use with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (like sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) or riociguat, acute circulatory failure (shock), severe anemia, increased intracranial pressure, or certain types of myocardial insufficiency.

* **Interactions:**  This medication can interact with various other drugs, including CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors, other hypotensives, and PDE-5 inhibitors. Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with volume depletion, moderate hypotension, or inferior wall myocardial infarction with suspected right ventricular involvement.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take isosorbide mononitrate with alcohol?** A: Combining isosorbide mononitrate with alcohol can increase the risk of hypotension. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store isosorbide mononitrate?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking isosorbide mononitrate suddenly?** A:  No, abruptly stopping this medication can cause rebound angina. Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding discontinuation.

* **Q: Will isosorbide mononitrate cure my angina?** A:  No, it manages the symptoms and reduces the risk of attacks but doesn't cure the underlying condition.
