# Isosorbide Mononitrate

**Generic Name:** Isosorbide Mononitrate

**Usage:**

Isosorbide mononitrate is used to prevent angina (chest pain).  It's a long-acting nitrate medication that helps relax and widen blood vessels, improving blood flow to the heart and reducing the workload on the heart muscle.  This reduces the frequency and severity of angina attacks.  It is often prescribed for chronic angina, meaning chest pain that occurs frequently.  It's *not* typically used to treat an acute angina attack (one happening right now).

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is very common, often occurring early in treatment and usually subsiding with continued use.  Over-the-counter pain relievers can often help.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by the blood pressure lowering effects.
* **Lightheadedness:** Similar to dizziness, it's related to blood vessel dilation.
* **Flushing:** Feeling of warmth or redness in the skin.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Low blood pressure:** Can cause fainting or weakness.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):** Paradoxical effect in some individuals.
* **Severe hypotension (very low blood pressure):** Can lead to fainting or shock.


**How it Works:**

Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the walls of blood vessels, causing them to widen (vasodilation). This dilation primarily affects the veins, leading to decreased preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart).  The reduced preload decreases the workload on the heart, reducing oxygen demand and thus preventing angina attacks.  It also, to a lesser extent, dilates arteries, reducing afterload (the resistance the heart must overcome to pump blood).

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take isosorbide mononitrate as needed?** A: No, isosorbide mononitrate is typically taken on a regular schedule, usually once or twice daily, to prevent angina.  Taking it "as needed" is generally ineffective for this purpose.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking isosorbide mononitrate?** A:  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of isosorbide mononitrate, particularly low blood pressure.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Q: Can I stop taking isosorbide mononitrate suddenly?** A:  No.  Stopping suddenly can lead to rebound angina, which can be more severe than before treatment.  Your doctor should help you gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects such as severe headache, dizziness, fainting, or allergic reactions.
