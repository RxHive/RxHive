# Iodine I-125 Iotalamate
### Generic Name
Iodine I-125 Iotalamate

### Usage
Iodine I-125 Iotalamate is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily in renal nuclear medicine studies to assess glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  GFR is a measure of how well the kidneys are filtering waste products from the blood.  This test helps diagnose and monitor various kidney diseases, allowing healthcare professionals to track the progression or response to treatment.  It's a crucial tool in evaluating kidney function, particularly in patients suspected of having renal impairment.

### Dosage

**Glomerular Filtration Evaluation:**

* **Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the administration method:
    * **Single Injection:** 10-30 microcuries (0.37-1.11 MBq) for a 70 kg patient.  Adjustments for patients of different weights are not explicitly detailed in the provided information, and should be determined by a physician.
    * **Continuous Infusion:** 20-100 microcuries (0.74-3.7 MBq) for a 70 kg patient. Adjustments for patients of different weights are not explicitly detailed in the provided information, and should be determined by a physician.

* **Children:** Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.  This medication should not be used in children.

**Administration:**  Intravenous (IV) administration is the standard route.  For single-injection methods, a significant oral water load is recommended.  For continuous infusions, the rate is typically 0.5 mL/minute.  Rapid or bolus injections should be avoided.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided information does not detail adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional who considers individual patient factors.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are not explicitly listed in the provided information.  However, as with any radiopharmaceutical, there is a potential for radiation exposure-related side effects.

Serious, less common side effects, though not specifically detailed here, include the potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.  These risks are associated with radiation exposure and are generally considered rare with appropriate handling and dosage.

*Note:*  Any unusual or concerning symptoms after administration should be reported to a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Iodine I-125 iotalamate is a radiopharmaceutical that incorporates a radioactive isotope of iodine (Iodine-125).  Once injected intravenously, it is filtered by the glomeruli in the kidneys. The rate at which the iodine is cleared from the blood provides a measure of the GFR. This information is then used to assess kidney function.  The radioactivity allows for imaging and quantification of the filtration process.


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Central venous line administration is contraindicated.
* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility.
* **Pregnancy:**  Iodine I-125 Iotalamate is categorized as a pregnancy Category C drug, meaning the potential for fetal harm exists.  Its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only employed when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, but because radioiodine is excreted in human milk, formula feeding is recommended during use.
* **Handling:**  Strict precautions are necessary for handling, disposal, and minimizing exposure to patients and healthcare personnel to prevent radiation exposure.  This medication should only be used under the supervision of trained professionals experienced in handling radioactive materials.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Iodine I-125 Iotalamate stored?**  A: Storage guidelines should be followed according to the manufacturer's instructions and relevant regulatory requirements for handling radioactive materials.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: This medication is not typically administered on a regular schedule.  The test is performed once, as directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions before or after the test?**  A: A significant water load is often prescribed, as outlined above in the dosage instructions.  Specific dietary guidelines may vary based on physician instructions.
* **Q: What if I experience adverse reactions?** A: Any unusual symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.
* **Q: How long does the radiation stay in my body?** A: The duration of radioactivity in the body depends on the dosage and individual factors, and is determined based on the type and amount of the radioactive isotope used.

**Disclaimer:**  This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before using any medication, including Iodine I-125 Iotalamate.  The dosage and administration should be determined by a physician experienced in the use of radiopharmaceuticals.
