# Irbesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels and reducing the amount of fluid in the body, thus lowering blood pressure.  It may be used alone or with other medications to control blood pressure.  It is sometimes prescribed for patients who haven't achieved adequate blood pressure control with either irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide alone.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is relatively common, especially when starting the medication.
* **Headache:**  Can occur in the initial stages of treatment.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Upper respiratory infection:** Such as cold or flu-like symptoms.
* **Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing):**  A sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up.
* **Muscle cramps:** Especially in the legs.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Cough:** A dry, persistent cough is possible, especially with irbesartan.


**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood):**  Can be dangerous and requires medical attention.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can lead to dizziness and fainting.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Such as rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Kidney problems:**  Especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
* **Elevated uric acid levels (gout):** Can cause painful inflammation of joints.


**This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects.**


**How it Works:**

Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  Angiotensin II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels. Irbesartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, causing blood vessels to relax and widen, thus lowering blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It works by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. This reduces the volume of blood, which also lowers blood pressure.  The combination of these two medications provides a synergistic effect, resulting in more effective blood pressure control than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide with other medications?**  You should always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, as there may be interactions.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to see the full effect of this medication.
* **When should I contact my doctor?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe side effects, such as chest pain, swelling of the face or limbs, or difficulty breathing.  Regular monitoring of your blood pressure and potassium levels is important.
* **Can I stop taking this medication abruptly?**  No, you should gradually reduce the dosage under your doctor's supervision to avoid potential rebound effects.
