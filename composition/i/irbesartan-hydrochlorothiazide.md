# Irbesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Irbesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide

### Usage

Irbesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by combining two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) – irbesartan – and a thiazide diuretic – hydrochlorothiazide.  Irbesartan blocks the effects of a hormone called angiotensin II, which narrows blood vessels.  Hydrochlorothiazide helps the body get rid of excess salt and water, also lowering blood pressure.  This combination therapy is often prescribed when a single medication isn't enough to control blood pressure effectively.  While primarily used for hypertension, it may sometimes be considered in managing certain types of chronic kidney disease associated with hypertension.  However, the decision to use this combination for kidney disease is made on a case-by-case basis by a physician.

### Dosage

Dosage is always determined by a doctor based on individual health conditions and response to treatment.  There is no universally applicable dosage.  The medication is available in tablet form for oral administration.

* **Adults:**  The typical starting dose is one tablet daily.  The doctor may adjust the dose, potentially increasing it, if blood pressure isn't adequately controlled.  Higher doses are not recommended without medical supervision.

* **Children:** This medication is not typically recommended for children.  Alternative treatments are usually considered for pediatric hypertension.

* **Oral Administration:**  The tablets should be swallowed whole with water. They can be taken with or without food.  Consistency in daily timing is crucial for effective blood pressure management.

* **IV Administration:**  Irbesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide is not available in an intravenous (IV) formulation.

It's absolutely vital to follow the doctor's prescribed dosage and not adjust the medication amount without consulting them.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps
* Dry mouth


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, require immediate medical attention:

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema – a serious allergic reaction)
* Difficulty breathing
* Irregular heartbeat
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Kidney problems
* Changes in liver function tests


If any unusual or concerning side effects occur, it's crucial to contact a doctor or other healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Irbesartan blocks the angiotensin II hormone, which normally causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow).  By blocking this effect, irbesartan helps relax and widen the blood vessels, reducing blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that increases urine production by promoting the excretion of sodium and water from the body.  Reducing the volume of blood in the circulatory system helps lower blood pressure.  Together, these two mechanisms work synergistically to provide more effective blood pressure control than either drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in people with known allergies to irbesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, or any of the inactive ingredients in the tablet. It should not be used in patients with severe liver or kidney disease. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:** Many drugs can interact with irbesartan + hydrochlorothiazide, including potassium supplements, other blood pressure medications, lithium, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Warnings:**  Elderly patients, those with impaired kidney function, or individuals with a history of heart failure may require dose adjustments or close monitoring. This medication can cause dizziness or lightheadedness; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.

* **Monitoring:** Regular blood pressure monitoring and periodic blood tests (to check potassium and kidney function) are recommended during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can cause a dangerous rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your dosage.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure, potentially leading to harmful interactions with this medication. Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for people with diabetes?** A: While generally safe, it's crucial for people with diabetes to have their blood glucose levels closely monitored as this medication may affect blood sugar levels.

* **Q:  What if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects, such as angioedema, difficulty breathing, or severe dizziness.
