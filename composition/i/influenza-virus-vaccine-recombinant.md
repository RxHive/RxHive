# Influenza Virus Vaccine Recombinant
### Generic Name
Influenza Virus Vaccine Recombinant

### Usage
Influenza virus vaccine recombinant is a vaccine used for active immunization against influenza (flu) caused by influenza virus subtypes A and B.  It's specifically indicated for individuals aged 18 years and older.  The vaccine aims to prevent illness caused by the influenza strains included in the formulation for that specific season.  This is a preventative measure; it does not treat an active influenza infection.

### Dosage
**Adults (18 years and older):**  A single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose is recommended per influenza season.  The injection should be given in the deltoid muscle.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of this vaccine have not been established for individuals under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are specified based on hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of individuals):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Pain at the injection site
* Tenderness at the injection site
* Muscle aches (myalgia)

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of individuals):**

* Chills
* Shivering
* Nausea
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Swelling at the injection site
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Fever


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (post-marketing reports):**

* Urticaria (hives)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Other hypersensitivity reactions

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, especially severe reactions like anaphylaxis, seek immediate medical attention.  Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works
The influenza virus vaccine recombinant works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the specific influenza virus strains included in the vaccine.  These antibodies provide protection against future infection by those strains.  It uses a recombinant technology, meaning specific viral proteins are produced in a cell culture rather than using the whole inactivated virus. This makes the vaccine safe for use in most individuals.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This vaccine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous influenza vaccination or any component of the vaccine formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, syncope (fainting), febrile seizures, and shoulder injuries related to the injection.
* Use with caution in severely immunocompromised patients, patients with bleeding disorders, a history of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), or those receiving anticoagulant therapy.
* Pregnancy:  Categorized as pregnancy category B.  Influenza vaccination is generally recommended during pregnancy.  Consult your healthcare provider.
* Breastfeeding:  Excretion in breast milk is unknown. The decision to breastfeed following immunization should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider.
* Drug Interactions:  Potential interactions exist with certain medications, including immunosuppressants, belimumab, doxofylline, fingolimod, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13-valent), and venetoclax.  Discuss any medications you are taking with your healthcare provider before receiving the influenza vaccine.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection from this vaccine last?** A: The protection typically lasts for a single influenza season.  Annual vaccination is recommended.

* **Q: Can I get the flu from this vaccine?** A: No, this is an inactivated (killed) virus vaccine. It cannot cause influenza. Some individuals might experience mild side effects mimicking flu symptoms, but these are generally mild and temporary.

* **Q: What should I do if I faint after receiving the vaccine?** A: Lie down immediately. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention.

* **Q: Should I get vaccinated if I am currently sick?** A: For mild illnesses, it is generally safe to get vaccinated.  However, if you are experiencing a moderate or severe illness, it's best to postpone vaccination until you recover.  Consult your healthcare provider.

* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A:  The manufacturer's instructions regarding storage should be strictly adhered to.  Typically, this involves refrigeration at a specific temperature.

* **Q:  Is this vaccine safe for people with allergies?** A: While generally safe, individuals with known allergies to specific components of the vaccine should inform their healthcare provider before receiving it.
