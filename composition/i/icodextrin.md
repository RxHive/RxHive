# Icodextrin
### Generic Name
Icodextrin

### Usage
Icodextrin is a unique dialysis solution and an adhesiolysis agent.  Its primary use is as an adjunct in laparoscopic gynecologic surgery to reduce post-surgical adhesions.  It's also used in the management of end-stage kidney disease via continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD).  In essence, it serves two distinct but important roles: preventing adhesions after surgery and facilitating dialysis for patients with failing kidneys.

### Dosage

**Laparoscopic Gynecologic Surgery:**

*   **Intraperitoneal Irrigation:** At least 100 mL is irrigated every 30 minutes during the surgery. After the procedure, any remaining fluid is aspirated, and then 1 liter is instilled into the abdominal cavity.

**Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) or Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD):**

*   **Intraperitoneal Infusion:** A single daily exchange is administered in either CAPD or APD.
*   **Dwell Time:**  The recommended dwell time is 8-16 hours.  Specific approved usage may vary depending on the product formulation; always refer to the product labeling for precise instructions.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of icodextrin in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. It's crucial to note that some icodextrin formulations are not approved for use in CAPD or APD in patients with renal impairment, and its safety in this population is not established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (CAPD/APD):**

*   Hypertension
*   Upper respiratory infection
*   Peritonitis
*   Headache
*   Dizziness

**Side Effects (Laparoscopic Surgery):**  Similar side effects may occur, but the frequency and types might differ. Common side effects in this context include headache, dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), nausea, and constipation.  Less common but possible side effects include pyrexia (fever), insomnia, flatulence, abdominal distention, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria (painful urination), urinary tract infection, and various genital or pelvic swelling or bleeding.  

**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Icodextrin works by creating osmotic pressure. In the context of dialysis, this draws fluid from the body across the peritoneal membrane into the dialysis solution.  The solution also provides electrolytes and lactate to maintain electrolyte and acid-base balance.  During laparoscopic surgery, icodextrin's colloidal osmotic action keeps the solution in the peritoneal cavity for several days, creating a physical barrier between peritoneal surfaces and minimizing the formation of adhesions.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Hypersensitivity to icodextrin, cornstarch, or any formulation component.
*   Glycogen storage disease.
*   Maltose or isomaltose intolerance.
*   Severe lactic acidosis (some formulations only).
*   Infection (including peritonitis), procedures involving laparotomy, bowel resection or repair, and appendectomy (some formulations only).


**Warnings:** Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and peritonitis exists. Use with caution in breastfeeding women.  


**Drug Interactions:** Icodextrin and its metabolites can interfere with certain amylase assays, leading to inaccurate results.  It can also cause falsely elevated blood glucose readings with some glucose monitoring devices; glucose-specific methods are recommended.



### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I use icodextrin if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion in studies of icodextrin for adhesion prevention.  Its effects on pregnancy following gynecological surgery are unknown. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.

*   **Q: How is icodextrin stored?** A: Refer to the specific product labeling for storage instructions, as this can vary by formulation.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.

*   **Q: Is icodextrin safe for long-term use in CAPD/APD?** A: The long-term safety profile in CAPD/APD should be discussed with your nephrologist.

*   **Q: Is icodextrin suitable for all types of dialysis?** A:  No, its use is primarily limited to CAPD and APD.

*   **Q: Can icodextrin be administered intravenously?** A: No, it's intended for intraperitoneal administration only.
