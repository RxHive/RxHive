# Ibuprofen + Paracetamol + Magnesium Oxide
### Generic Name

Ibuprofen + Paracetamol + Magnesium Oxide


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for the relief of mild to moderate pain and fever.  The ibuprofen and paracetamol components act synergistically to provide broader pain relief than either drug alone. Ibuprofen works by reducing inflammation and pain, while paracetamol reduces fever and provides pain relief through a different mechanism.  The addition of magnesium oxide is intended to help reduce gastrointestinal distress that can sometimes be associated with ibuprofen and paracetamol.  It's important to note that this combination is not suitable for all types of pain, and more serious pain or persistent symptoms warrant a consultation with a healthcare professional. This combination may be used for conditions such as headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, toothaches, and the common cold's accompanying aches and fever.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation and the age and weight of the patient.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.**  There is no single standard dosage for this combination as formulations differ.  Some products may be available as tablets, capsules, or liquid suspensions.  

* **Adults:**  The usual adult dose is typically one or two tablets/capsules every 4-6 hours as needed, but do not exceed the maximum daily dose specified on the packaging. Never take more than the recommended daily dose.

* **Children:** This combination medication is generally not recommended for children under a specific age (usually 12 years old or older, depending on the formulation), due to varying concentrations of ibuprofen and paracetamol in available formulations.  **Always consult a pediatrician or pharmacist before administering any medication to a child.**  Children's formulations of ibuprofen and paracetamol exist but usually don't include magnesium oxide.

* **Oral Administration:** Tablets or capsules should be swallowed whole with a full glass of water. Liquid suspensions should be shaken well before each dose and measured accurately with the provided measuring device.

* **IV Administration:** This combination is not typically available for intravenous (IV) administration. Ibuprofen and paracetamol are sometimes given intravenously, but separately and under strict medical supervision. Magnesium oxide is not typically given intravenously for pain relief.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  These are generally mild and temporary.  They may include nausea, stomach upset, heartburn, indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, and rash.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are rare but require immediate medical attention.  They include allergic reactions (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; hives); severe stomach pain; bleeding or bruising easily; unusual fatigue; yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice); and changes in urine color or frequency.


### How it Works

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever and provides pain relief through a less clearly understood mechanism, possibly involving the central nervous system. Magnesium oxide is an antacid and helps to neutralize stomach acid, thus potentially reducing the gastrointestinal side effects associated with ibuprofen and paracetamol.  The combined effect is a broader spectrum of pain relief and fever reduction.
