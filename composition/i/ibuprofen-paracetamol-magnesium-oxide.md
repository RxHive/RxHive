# Ibuprofen + Paracetamol + Magnesium Oxide

**Generic Name:** Ibuprofen + Paracetamol + Magnesium Oxide (combination product –  no single generic name exists as the combination is not standardized across manufacturers)

**Usage:** This combination is typically used to relieve:

* **Pain:**  Mild to moderate pain from various sources, such as headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, toothaches, and back pain.
* **Fever:**  Reduces fever associated with infections or illnesses.
* **Inflammation (Ibuprofen component):** Ibuprofen has anti-inflammatory properties, making it helpful for conditions involving inflammation.  The magnesium oxide may also have a mild anti-inflammatory effect.

**Note:**  The specific uses and dosages will vary depending on the manufacturer and the formulation. Always follow the instructions on the product label and consult a doctor or pharmacist if unsure.  This combination is not suitable for all conditions and may not be appropriate for certain individuals.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dose.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea.  Magnesium oxide can cause diarrhea, especially in high doses.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).
* **Central nervous system:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache.
* **Other:**  Ibuprofen can increase the risk of bleeding or bruising.  High doses of paracetamol can damage the liver.


**How it Works:**

* **Ibuprofen:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. It also reduces fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** A pain reliever and fever reducer.  The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Magnesium Oxide:**  Acts as an antacid, neutralizing stomach acid, which can help to reduce gastrointestinal discomfort associated with ibuprofen and paracetamol.  It might also have a mild anti-inflammatory effect.  It’s often added to buffer the gastrointestinal irritation potential of the NSAID (Ibuprofen).
