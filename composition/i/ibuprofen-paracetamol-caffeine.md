**How it Works:** This combination medication works through three different mechanisms:

* **Ibuprofen:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild pain relief through a mechanism that is not fully understood but is believed to involve affecting prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system.
* **Caffeine:** A stimulant that enhances the effects of ibuprofen and paracetamol by improving their absorption and increasing their analgesic (pain-relieving) effects.  It also has a mild stimulant effect that can help alleviate drowsiness.
