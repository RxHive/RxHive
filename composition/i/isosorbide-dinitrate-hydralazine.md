# Isosorbide Dinitrate + Hydralazine

**Generic Name:** Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine

**Usage:**

Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine is used to treat **severe chronic heart failure** in adults who haven't responded well enough to other heart failure medications (like ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers).  It's often used in combination with these other medications, not as a standalone treatment.  This combination medication is specifically designed to improve the symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath and fatigue, and improve the patient's quality of life.  It's important to note that it *does not cure* heart failure, but rather helps manage its symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Headache:** This is a very common side effect, often occurring early in treatment.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by a drop in blood pressure.
* **Lightheadedness:**  Similar to dizziness, often related to postural hypotension (low blood pressure when standing).
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Flushing:** Redness of the face, neck, and chest.
* **Rapid heart rate (tachycardia):**  In some cases.
* **Shortness of breath:** While used to treat shortness of breath in heart failure, it may also cause it, especially at the start of treatment.

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):**  This can cause fainting or dizziness.
* **Fluid retention (edema):**  Swelling in the ankles, legs, or feet.
* **Increased heart rate:**  Tachycardia.
* **Angina (chest pain):**  May worsen in some individuals.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.

**How it Works:**

Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine work together to improve blood flow and reduce strain on the heart.

* **Isosorbide dinitrate** is a nitrate that dilates (widens) blood vessels, reducing the workload on the heart. This reduces blood pressure and improves blood flow.

* **Hydralazine** is a vasodilator that also works to relax and widen blood vessels, primarily arterioles (small arteries). This reduces blood pressure and afterload (the resistance the heart must overcome to pump blood).

By working together, these two drugs improve cardiac output (the amount of blood the heart pumps) and reduce the pressure on the heart, thus easing symptoms of heart failure.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  This is especially important with other blood pressure medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to rebound effects, including a worsening of heart failure symptoms.  You must gradually reduce the dose under your doctor's supervision.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Severe chest pain, severe dizziness or fainting, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or severe shortness of breath require immediate medical attention.

* **Q:  How long will I need to take this medication?** A:  This depends on your individual response to treatment and the severity of your heart failure.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
