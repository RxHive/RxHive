# Isosorbide Dinitrate + Hydralazine
### Generic Name
Isosorbide Dinitrate/Hydralazine

### Usage
Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine is a combination medication used primarily to treat chronic heart failure in adults.  It's particularly helpful for patients whose heart failure symptoms aren't adequately controlled with other treatments, especially those with symptoms of fluid retention and high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg).  This combination drug works by improving the heart's ability to pump blood and reducing the workload on the heart. While not a first-line treatment for heart failure, it plays a significant role in managing symptoms and improving the quality of life for many patients.  It is *not* used to treat acute heart failure episodes.


### Dosage
The dosage of Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on the patient's specific condition and response to treatment.  There isn't a standard "child dosage" as this medication is generally not used in pediatric populations.


* **Oral Administration (Adults):** The typical starting dose is one 37.5 mg/25 mg tablet three times daily, usually taken every 8 hours.  This dose may be gradually increased by the physician, but increases should be done cautiously and under close medical supervision due to potential side effects.  The maximum daily dose varies depending on individual tolerance.
* **Other Forms:**  This combination medication is generally only available in oral tablet form. There are no IV formulations.


It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and frequency exactly as directed by a doctor.  Skipping doses or adjusting the dosage without medical guidance can be harmful.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, flushing, and fatigue. These are often mild and may lessen over time.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Low blood pressure (hypotension), rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), palpitations, shortness of breath, swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs (edema), and allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* **Important Note:**  If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider if you experience any side effects that bother you or don't go away.


### How it Works
Isosorbide dinitrate is a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and reduces the strain on the heart.  Hydralazine also acts as a vasodilator, primarily affecting the arterioles (smaller arteries). This dual action helps to decrease the workload on the heart and improve its efficiency in pumping blood. By reducing vascular resistance and easing the strain on the heart, this combination drug improves the symptoms of heart failure.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine should not be used in individuals with a known allergy to either isosorbide dinitrate or hydralazine. It's also contraindicated in cases of severe anemia or severe aortic stenosis.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with numerous other drugs, including other blood pressure medications, nitrates, and certain antidepressants.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a healthcare professional due to the potential risks to the fetus or infant.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication.  Careful dose titration and monitoring are essential.
* **Other Warnings:**  This drug can cause dizziness and lightheadedness, so it is important to avoid activities that require alertness until you know how this medication affects you. Avoid alcohol while taking this medicine.
