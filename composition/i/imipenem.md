# Imipenem
### Generic Name
Imipenem/Cilastatin

### Usage

Imipenem/cilastatin is a combination antibiotic used to treat severe bacterial infections in various parts of the body.  Its primary use is for treating serious infections that are resistant to other antibiotics.  These infections can include:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen, often involving the intestines or peritoneum.  These can be life-threatening.
* **Pelvic infections:** Infections in the female reproductive organs.
* **Pneumonia:**  Severe lung infections, especially those caused by bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infections):**  A serious condition where bacteria enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Severe or complicated UTIs that don't respond to other treatments.
* **Meningitis:** Infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (in specific cases).

Imipenem/cilastatin may also be used for other infections as determined by a physician, such as certain skin and skin structure infections.  However, it's crucial to note that this medication is typically reserved for serious infections that haven't responded to less potent antibiotics.

### Dosage

Dosage of imipenem/cilastatin varies significantly depending on the severity and type of infection, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  The following is a summary, not a substitute for medical advice:

**Adults:** The typical dosage is administered intravenously (IV). Doses of 500mg or less are infused over 15-30 minutes; larger doses are infused over 40-60 minutes.  The frequency and total daily dose depend on the infection's severity, ranging from 250mg every six hours to 1 gram three or four times daily.  Renal impairment requires significant dosage adjustments.

**Children:**  Dosage for children is determined by weight and age, usually calculated as milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into multiple doses.  Dosage can be adjusted in children with renal impairment, as with adults.  Specific recommendations must be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Forms:**  Imipenem/cilastatin is typically available only as a powder for intravenous (IV) infusion.  It is not administered orally.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Rash
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Increased BUN/serum creatinine (indicating potential kidney problems)
* Phlebitis (inflammation of the vein at the injection site)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Seizures
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Liver function abnormalities
* Blood disorders (anemia, neutropenia)
* Renal failure
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but severe skin reaction)


If you experience any side effects, especially severe or persistent ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Imipenem is a carbapenem antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Bacteria need this cell wall for survival.  By disrupting the building process, imipenem prevents bacterial cells from growing and reproducing, effectively killing the bacteria. Cilastatin is included in the formulation to prevent the breakdown of imipenem by the kidneys, thus ensuring a more effective dose reaches the bloodstream to combat infection.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Imipenem/cilastatin should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to carbapenems or penicillins (cross-reactivity can occur).
* **Kidney disease:**  Dosage adjustments are crucial for patients with kidney problems to avoid toxicity.
* **Central nervous system disorders:**  Imipenem can increase the risk of seizures, especially in patients with pre-existing neurological conditions. Close monitoring is required.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Imipenem/cilastatin should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor.
* **Drug interactions:**  Imipenem/cilastatin may interact with several other medications, including valproic acid (an anti-seizure medication) and probenecid (used to treat gout).  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Imipenem/cilastatin orally?**
* **A:** No, Imipenem/cilastatin is administered intravenously (IV) only.


* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?**
* **A:** The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of infection and your response to therapy. Your doctor will determine the appropriate course.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
* **A:** Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance. Do not double the next dose.


* **Q: How should I store Imipenem/cilastatin?**
* **A:** Store as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool and dry place, protected from light.


* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking Imipenem/cilastatin?**
* **A:**  Long-term use can increase the risk of developing resistant bacteria or experiencing side effects. Your doctor will monitor you closely.
