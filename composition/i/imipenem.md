# Imipenem

**Generic Name:** Imipenem

**Usage:** Imipenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections that are resistant to other antibiotics.  These infections can affect various parts of the body, including:

*   Serious skin and skin structure infections
*   Intestinal infections
*   Pelvic infections
*   Lung infections (pneumonia)
*   Infections of the blood (bacteremia)
*   Intra-abdominal infections
*   Bone and joint infections
*   Central nervous system infections (meningitis, brain abscess)
*   Sepsis

Imipenem is usually given intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) and is almost always administered in combination with cilastatin. Cilastatin is a dehydropeptidase I inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of imipenem in the kidneys, allowing for higher and more effective levels in the bloodstream. It's crucial to note that imipenem is almost never prescribed alone and is always used with cilastatin.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, imipenem can cause side effects.  The most common side effects are:

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Rash
*   Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
*   Headache

Less common but more serious side effects include:

*   Seizures (especially in patients with a history of seizures or kidney problems)
*   Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis)
*   Pseudomembranous colitis (a serious intestinal infection caused by *Clostridium difficile*)
*   Kidney problems
*   Changes in blood counts (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)

**How it Works:** Imipenem is a carbapenem antibiotic. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycans, which are essential components of bacterial cell walls.  By preventing the formation of these cell walls, imipenem causes bacterial cell death.  Its broad spectrum of activity means it's effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
