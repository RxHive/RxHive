# Ivermectin
### Generic Name
Ivermectin

### Usage
Ivermectin is primarily used to treat parasitic infections in humans and animals.  Its main application in humans is for the treatment and prevention of infections caused by various parasitic worms (helminths), including strongyloidiasis (roundworm infection), onchocerciasis (river blindness), lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), and scabies (a skin mite infestation).  It's also used to treat intestinal strongyloidiasis and head lice infestations.  While it has been the subject of much discussion regarding its use in treating viral infections like COVID-19,  **it is important to note that its efficacy against viral infections is not established by robust scientific evidence and is not approved for this purpose by major health regulatory bodies.**

### Dosage
Ivermectin dosage varies significantly depending on the specific infection being treated, the patient's weight and age, and the formulation (oral tablets, topical cream, or injectable solution).  Precise dosage instructions must always be obtained from a healthcare professional and followed meticulously.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.  There are no generally accepted pediatric dosage guidelines outside of specific parasitic infections, as it's used cautiously in children.  Dosage for adults will also vary widely by infection; there is no single universally applicable dosage. IV administration is not standard for ivermectin; it’s primarily administered orally or topically.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of ivermectin are generally mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Liver damage
* Neurological effects (seizures, coma – very rare)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, immediately seek medical attention.

### How it Works
Ivermectin works by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This binding increases chloride permeability of the cell membrane, causing hyperpolarization of the cell and paralysis of the parasite.  Essentially, it disrupts the nervous system of the parasite, leading to its death or inability to function properly. This mechanism is specific to invertebrates and doesn't significantly affect the mammalian nervous system at therapeutic doses, making it relatively safe for humans when used appropriately.

### Precautions
Ivermectin should be used with caution in:

* **Pregnant and breastfeeding women:** Use is generally avoided unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks; consult a doctor before use.
* **Patients with liver or kidney disease:** Dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Children:**  Use should be strictly as directed by a physician, and is typically only indicated for specific parasitic infections.
* **Individuals with a history of seizures:**  There's a slightly increased risk of seizures.
* **Concurrent medication:** Ivermectin can interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants. It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you are taking.

**Ivermectin is not a substitute for antibiotics or antiviral medications.**

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I buy ivermectin over-the-counter?** A:  The availability of ivermectin varies by country and region. In some areas, it may be available over-the-counter for certain uses, while in others it requires a prescription. Always follow local regulations and consult a healthcare provider.

* **Q: Is ivermectin effective against COVID-19?** A: Major health organizations worldwide, including the FDA and WHO, have stated that there is no strong evidence to support the use of ivermectin in the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.  The available clinical trials have not shown consistent positive results, and in some cases, have shown potential harm.

* **Q: How should I store ivermectin?** A: Store ivermectin as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions on what to do if you miss a dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
