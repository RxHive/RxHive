# Ivermectin

**Generic Name:** Ivermectin

**Usage:**

Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication used to treat various infestations caused by parasites.  Its specific uses vary by formulation and dosage:

* **Strongyloidiasis and Onchocerciasis:**  These are parasitic worm infections affecting the intestines and eyes, respectively. Ivermectin is a first-line treatment for both.
* **Head Lice:** Topical formulations are used to treat head lice infestations.
* **Scabies:** Topical formulations are used to treat scabies, a skin infestation by mites.
* **River Blindness (Onchocerciasis):**  Used to kill the parasitic worms that cause this debilitating disease.
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Kills parasitic worms that infect the intestines.
* **Certain Intestinal Parasites:**  Used to treat various other intestinal parasitic worms (e.g., some types of roundworms).

**Important Note:**  The use of ivermectin for COVID-19 or other viral infections is **not supported by scientific evidence** and is **strongly discouraged**.  Using ivermectin for conditions it's not approved for can be dangerous and ineffective.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and only take medications as prescribed.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, but can include:

* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Abdominal pain:** Pain in the stomach area.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or redness.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Itching:** A feeling of irritation on the skin.

More serious side effects are rare but possible and include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild to severe (anaphylaxis).
* **Liver damage:**  In rare cases, particularly with high doses or prolonged use.
* **Neurological effects:**  Though rare, these can include seizures, coma, and other serious neurological issues, especially with high doses.


**How it Works:**

Ivermectin works by increasing the permeability of the cell membranes of certain parasites. This leads to paralysis and death of the parasites.  The specific mechanism varies slightly depending on the parasite, but generally involves disrupting their nerve and muscle function.
