# Isavuconazole
### Generic Name
Isavuconazole (isavuconazonium sulfate)

### Usage
Isavuconazole is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat serious fungal infections in adults.  Its main applications are in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis.  These are life-threatening infections caused by fungi that can spread throughout the body, particularly affecting the lungs and other organs in immunocompromised individuals. While primarily used for these two conditions, it might be considered in other invasive fungal infections depending on the specific circumstances and under the guidance of a physician.


### Dosage
**Important Note:** Isavuconazole is available as isavuconazonium sulfate. 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate is equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole.  Dosage is determined by the physician based on individual patient factors and the specific infection.

**For Invasive Aspergillosis and Invasive Mucormycosis:**

* **Loading Dose (both oral and IV):** 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate every 8 hours for a total of 6 doses (48 hours).
* **Maintenance Dose (both oral and IV):** 372 mg isavuconazonium sulfate once daily. The maintenance dose begins 12-24 hours after the last loading dose.
* **Treatment Duration:** The length of treatment varies greatly depending on factors like the severity of the infection, the patient's immune system, and how well the treatment is working.  The minimum treatment duration is typically 6-12 weeks.  A physician will determine the appropriate duration.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of isavuconazole in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B).  For severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), use is only considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Careful monitoring is crucial.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is usually necessary.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can include:

* Severe liver injury (hepatotoxicity)
* Infusion-related reactions (hypotension, dyspnea, chills, etc., especially with IV administration)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality)

**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
Isavuconazonium sulfate is a prodrug; this means it's converted in the body to the active antifungal agent, isavuconazole. Isavuconazole works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of the fungal cell membrane.  By disrupting ergosterol production, isavuconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to fungal cell death. This mechanism effectively targets the fungus without significantly harming human cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Isavuconazole is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to isavuconazole or any component of the formulation; with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (like ketoconazole, high-dose ritonavir); with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (like rifampin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort, long-acting barbiturates); and in patients with familial short QT syndrome.
* **Interactions:** Isavuconazole can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  It's crucial to inform your physician of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Co-administration with venetoclax and dichlorphenamide should be avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Isavuconazole is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out. Alternative antifungal agents are generally preferred during pregnancy.  It's unknown if isavuconazole is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.  Effective contraception is recommended for women of childbearing age during treatment and for 28 days after the final dose.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use caution in patients with severe liver impairment.  Close monitoring of liver function is necessary.
* **Infusion Reactions (IV administration):**  Infusion-related reactions are possible.  Slow intravenous infusion over at least one hour helps minimize this risk.
* **Cardiac Effects:**  There's a potential for QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality). It should be used with caution in patients with underlying cardiac conditions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take isavuconazole with food?** A: Oral capsules can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store isavuconazole?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist or physician; generally, protect from moisture and extreme temperatures.
* **Q: Can I stop taking isavuconazole if I feel better?** A:  No, it is crucial to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your physician, even if you start feeling better.  Stopping early can lead to the infection returning or becoming resistant to treatment.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking isavuconazole?** A: There aren't typically specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet and staying well-hydrated are always advisable.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking isavuconazole?** A: Alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor; it could potentially interact with isavuconazole or worsen side effects.
