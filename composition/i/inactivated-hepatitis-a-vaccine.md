**Generic Name:** Inactivated Hepatitis A Vaccine (various manufacturers, may be marketed under different brand names)

    * Children and adolescents starting at 6 months of age.
    * Travelers visiting countries with high rates of Hepatitis A.
    * Men who have sex with men.
    * People who use injection drugs.

* **Vaccination Schedules:** The schedule typically involves two doses given 6-12 months apart.  The specific schedule may vary slightly depending on age and individual circumstances.  Consult a healthcare provider for the appropriate schedule.


**Side Effects:**

Most side effects are mild and temporary.  Common side effects include:

* Severe weakness or dizziness.


**How it Works:**

The inactivated Hepatitis A vaccine contains inactivated (killed) hepatitis A virus.  This allows the body's immune system to build antibodies against the virus without causing the infection.  Once vaccinated, your body is prepared to fight off the virus if exposed, preventing or lessening the severity of Hepatitis A.


**FAQs:**

* **Is the inactivated vaccine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Generally considered safe, but consult a doctor before vaccination.
* **Can I get Hepatitis A even after being vaccinated?**  While highly effective, the vaccine doesn't provide 100% protection.  A small percentage of vaccinated individuals might still contract a mild form of the disease.
* **How long does the immunity last?**  The immunity provided by the vaccine is thought to be long-lasting, possibly lifelong for most people.
* **What if I missed a dose?**  Contact your doctor to determine the best course of action.  It's usually recommended to complete the vaccination series as soon as possible.
* **Are there any interactions with other medications?**  Inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking before vaccination.
* **Is this vaccine the same as the Hepatitis B vaccine?**  No, these are two separate vaccines against different viruses.  A person might need both vaccines depending on their risk factors.
