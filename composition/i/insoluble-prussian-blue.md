# Insoluble Prussian Blue
### Generic Name
Insoluble Prussian Blue

### Usage
Insoluble Prussian blue, also known as ferric hexacyanoferrate(II), is used to treat internal contamination with radioactive cesium and/or radioactive or non-radioactive thallium.  Its primary function is to enhance the elimination rate of these substances from the body.  This is crucial in cases of accidental ingestion or exposure to these toxins.

### Dosage

**Cesium or Thallium Contamination:**

* **Adults:** The typical oral dose is 3 grams three times daily (TID).
* **Children (2-12 years):** The oral dose is 1 gram TID.  If swallowing numerous capsules proves difficult, the contents may be mixed with bland food or liquids. Note that this may temporarily blue the mouth and teeth.
* **Adolescents:** The oral dose is 3 grams TID.


### Side Effects

* **Common (>10%):** Constipation
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Asymptomatic hypokalemia (low potassium levels)

While rare, more serious side effects can occur.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Insoluble Prussian blue works by binding to cesium and thallium isotopes within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This binding occurs after ingestion or following biliary excretion (release into bile). By binding to these substances, it prevents their reabsorption into the bloodstream, reducing enterohepatic circulation (recycling through the liver and intestines). This effectively facilitates their elimination through the feces.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Currently, no contraindications are explicitly listed for Insoluble Prussian blue.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients may experience constipation and blue discoloration of feces, oral mucosa (mouth lining), and teeth.
* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using Insoluble Prussian blue in patients with cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), electrolyte imbalances, or gastric immotility (problems with stomach emptying).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Insoluble Prussian blue is categorized as pregnancy Category C. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended for women with cesium or thallium contamination.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** While dosage adjustments aren't specified in the manufacturer's labeling, effectiveness might decrease in individuals with hepatic (liver) impairment due to reduced biliary excretion.  Renal (kidney) impairment doesn't necessitate dosage changes since Prussian blue isn't systemically absorbed.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Insoluble Prussian blue with food?** A: Yes, taking it with food may aid in the elimination of cesium or thallium.

* **Q: What if I experience constipation?** A: Constipation is a common side effect.  Treatment may involve a fiber-based laxative and/or a high-fiber diet.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q: Does Insoluble Prussian blue treat radiation exposure complications?** A: No, it decreases radiation exposure by enhancing the removal of cesium and thallium; it does not treat the consequences of radiation sickness.  Additional supportive treatment might be necessary for radiation toxicity symptoms.

* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: The duration depends on the level of contamination and the patient's response. Regular monitoring of cesium and/or thallium levels is crucial to determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q:  How is the effectiveness of treatment monitored?**  A: Monitoring involves regular checks of bowel movements, blood counts (CBC), electrolytes, and baseline/weekly measurements of cesium and/or thallium levels in the body (via whole body counting, bioassays, urine/feces samples).  Residual radioactivity after 30 days of treatment is also assessed.
