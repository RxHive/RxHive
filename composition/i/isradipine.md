# Isradipine
### Generic Name
Isradipine

### Usage
Isradipine is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers the pressure your heart has to pump against. This helps to reduce the strain on your cardiovascular system. While its primary use is for hypertension, it's important to note that this information is for general knowledge and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for self-treatment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.

### Dosage

Dosage of Isradipine varies considerably depending on the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release), the patient's age, and the severity of their hypertension.  It's crucial to follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  

**Adults:**

* **Immediate-release:** Typically starts at 2.5 mg twice daily (BID).  The dose can be gradually increased by 5 mg at intervals of 2-4 weeks, as directed by your physician. The maximum daily dose is usually 20 mg, although this might be lower for elderly individuals (10 mg/day).
* **Extended-release:** Often begins at 5 mg once daily (OD).  The dose can be adjusted upward in 5 mg increments every 2-4 weeks, as needed, up to a maximum of 20 mg daily.

**Children and Adolescents:**

The safety and efficacy of Isradipine in children and adolescents have not been established.  Use in this population is considered off-label and should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision with careful monitoring.  Dosage, if prescribed, is determined by the physician based on weight and other factors.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are sometimes necessary depending on factors like liver or kidney function. Individuals with hepatic or renal impairment may require lower initial doses and more cautious titration. Always inform your doctor of any pre-existing conditions.

### How it Works

Isradipine is a calcium channel blocker, specifically a dihydropyridine.  It works by preventing calcium ions from entering the muscle cells in the walls of your blood vessels.  Less calcium means the muscles relax, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels).  This reduced resistance to blood flow lowers your blood pressure.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Isradipine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Isradipine, other calcium channel blockers, or any components of the medication. It is also contraindicated in individuals with severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg).
* **Interactions:** Isradipine can interact with many other medications, including other antihypertensives, antifungal agents, antibiotics, and others.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypotension, severe aortic stenosis, hepatic or renal impairment, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and those with persistent skin reactions.  Close monitoring is also needed in elderly patients and those with a history of angina.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Isradipine is a Category C drug during pregnancy. This means potential risks to the fetus haven't been fully ruled out.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks, and only under the close supervision of a healthcare provider.  The excretion of Isradipine in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised when breastfeeding.
