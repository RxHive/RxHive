# Iopamidol
### Generic Name
Iopamidol

### Usage

Iopamidol is a non-ionic iodinated contrast agent primarily used in various medical imaging procedures to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and other anatomical structures.  Its primary use is as a diagnostic agent in angiography, which involves visualizing blood vessels within the cardiovascular system. This includes procedures such as cerebral and peripheral arteriography, coronary arteriography and ventriculography, pediatric angiocardiography, selective visceral arteriography and aortography, and peripheral venography (phlebography).  Beyond angiography, iopamidol is also used in computed tomography (CT) scans, myelography (spinal cord imaging), and urography (urinary tract imaging).  In essence, it helps medical professionals obtain clearer, more detailed images for diagnostic purposes.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following dosage information is for general guidance only.  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual patient's needs, the specific imaging procedure, the patient's age, weight, and overall health, and the concentration of the iopamidol solution.  Always refer to the product labeling for precise instructions.  Patients should be well-hydrated before and after administration.

**Adult Dosage (examples; see product labeling for full details):**

The dosage varies considerably depending on the specific procedure.  Examples include:

* **Cerebral Arteriography (intra-arterial):** 8-12 mL of a 300 mg/mL solution; maximum dose: 90 mL.
* **Peripheral Arteriography (intra-arterial):**  5-40 mL up to a total of 250 mL (femoral/subclavian),  25-50 mL up to a total of 250 mL (aorta).
* **Peripheral Venography (IV):** 25-150 mL per lower extremity, maximum 350 mL (200mg/mL solution).
* **Contrast-enhanced CT (IV):** 130-240 mL (250 mg/mL solution) or 100-200 mL (300 mg/mL solution); maximum doses specified.
* **Myelography (intrathecal):** 10-15 mL (200 mg/mL solution) or 10 mL (300 mg/mL solution), depending on the location and technique.

**Pediatric Dosage (examples; see product labeling for full details):**

Dosage for children is also highly dependent on the procedure, age, and weight.  Always follow the instructions of the prescribing physician.  Examples include:

* **Angiocardiography (IV):** Dosage ranges widely by age group from 10-50 mL single injections up to cumulative doses of 125 mL.
* **Contrast-enhanced CT (IV):**  1.2-3.6 mL/kg (250 mg/mL) or 1-3 mL/kg (300 mg/mL), with maximum doses specified.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Localized warmth at injection site
* Nausea
* Vomiting


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Contrast-induced nephropathy (kidney damage)
* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Thromboembolism


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Iopamidol contains iodine, an element that effectively absorbs X-rays.  When administered intravenously or directly into a blood vessel or body cavity (depending on the procedure), iopamidol temporarily increases the density of the area it flows through, allowing those structures (blood vessels, organs, etc.) to be visualized more clearly on X-ray images or CT scans. This opacification allows radiologists and other healthcare professionals to better diagnose a range of medical conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Intrathecal administration is contraindicated for solutions intended for IV use. Certain situations, such as concurrent intrathecal corticosteroid administration or significant local/systemic infection (for myelography), may also be contraindicated.

* **Drug Interactions:** Iopamidol may interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Warnings:**  Iopamidol carries a risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Individuals with a history of iodine allergy or hypersensitivity reactions to contrast media should be carefully monitored.   Patients with kidney disease, diabetes, multiple myeloma, or other conditions may be at increased risk of adverse effects.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare providers.  Elderly patients and those with cardiovascular or respiratory problems may require special attention.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for iopamidol to leave my body?** A:  Iopamidol is primarily excreted through the kidneys.  The elimination time varies depending on individual factors, but most of it is usually cleared within 24 hours.

* **Q: Is iopamidol safe during pregnancy?** A: The safety of iopamidol during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  The decision to use it during pregnancy should be made by a healthcare provider after carefully weighing the risks and benefits.

* **Q: Can I breastfeed after receiving iopamidol?** A:  It's generally recommended to temporarily discontinue breastfeeding for a period of 12-24 hours following iopamidol administration, as excretion into breast milk is unknown.  Consult your doctor for personalized advice.

* **Q: How is iopamidol stored?** A: Iopamidol should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature and protected from light.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A:  If you experience signs of an allergic reaction (such as hives, swelling, shortness of breath), seek immediate medical attention.
