# Insulin Aspart

**Generic Name:** Insulin aspart

**Usage:**

Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analog used to treat hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in adults and children with type 1 diabetes and adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's typically used to manage blood sugar levels before meals (bolus injection) to cover the carbohydrates consumed.  It can also be used in combination with intermediate- or long-acting insulins to provide both basal and bolus insulin coverage. The specific dosage and administration schedule are determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and blood glucose monitoring.

**Side Effects:**

Like all insulins, insulin aspart can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect, and can cause symptoms like sweating, trembling, weakness, dizziness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:**  These can include redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:** Insulin can cause weight gain in some individuals.
* **Lipohypertrophy:**  This is a buildup of fat tissue at the injection site.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, severe allergic reactions are possible.


Less common side effects can include:

* Vision changes
* Swelling in the hands or feet
* Changes in appetite


**How it Works:**

Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting insulin analog that works by mimicking the action of natural insulin produced by the pancreas. It helps glucose (sugar) move from the bloodstream into cells, where it can be used for energy.  Its rapid onset of action allows for better control of post-meal blood sugar spikes.  It starts working quickly (within 10-20 minutes), peaks in 1-3 hours, and its effects generally last for 3-5 hours.  The exact duration can vary depending on the individual and the dose.


**FAQs:**

* **How is insulin aspart administered?**  It's injected subcutaneously (under the skin) using an insulin pen or syringe.  It should *never* be administered intravenously.

* **Can I mix insulin aspart with other insulins?**  Check with your doctor or pharmacist.  Mixing is sometimes done, but compatibility must be considered to avoid precipitation (cloudiness) that could affect the effectiveness of the insulin.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor or follow the instructions provided by your healthcare team.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?**  Quickly consume a source of fast-acting carbohydrates like glucose tablets, fruit juice, or candy.  Monitor your blood glucose levels and seek medical attention if necessary.

* **How do I store insulin aspart?** Store unopened vials in the refrigerator.  Opened vials can be stored at room temperature (below 86°F or 30°C) for up to 28 days.  Avoid freezing.

* **Can I use insulin aspart if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** Consult your doctor.  Insulin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful monitoring and management.
