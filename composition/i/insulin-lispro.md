# Insulin Lispro

**Generic Name:** Insulin lispro

**Usage:** Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analog used to treat adults and children with type 1 diabetes and adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's used to control high blood sugar levels. It is typically injected before meals to help the body use the glucose from food.  It can also be used in insulin pump therapy.  Dosage is determined by a doctor based on individual needs and blood glucose monitoring.


**Side Effects:** Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect. Symptoms include sweating, shaking, dizziness, confusion, hunger, and rapid heartbeat.  Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:**  Redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:** Insulin can cause weight gain in some people.
* **Edema (fluid retention):**  Swelling in the hands, feet, or ankles.
* **Lipohypertrophy:**  Thickening or hardening of the skin at the injection site.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including hives, rash, itching, difficulty breathing, and swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  It is crucial to consult a doctor if any concerning side effects develop.


**How it Works:** Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting insulin analog that works by lowering blood sugar levels.  Unlike regular insulin, it has a faster onset of action and shorter duration. It mimics the body's natural insulin by binding to insulin receptors on cells, allowing glucose to enter the cells and be used for energy. This reduces the amount of glucose circulating in the bloodstream.


**FAQs:**

* **How quickly does it work?** Insulin lispro typically begins to work within 15-30 minutes, peaks in 1-2 hours, and its effects last for 3-5 hours.

* **How is it administered?** It is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) using a syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump.

* **Can I mix it with other insulins?** It is often mixed with intermediate- or long-acting insulins in a single injection.  However, always follow your doctor's instructions and mixing guidelines precisely.

* **How should I store it?**  Unopened vials should be refrigerated.  Opened vials should be stored at room temperature (below 86°F or 30°C) and discarded after 28 days.  Insulin pens should be stored as directed by the manufacturer.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor or diabetes educator for guidance.  Never double a dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?** Treat low blood sugar immediately with a fast-acting carbohydrate source like glucose tablets, juice, or candy.  If symptoms don't improve, seek medical attention.
