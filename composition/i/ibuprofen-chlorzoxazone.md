### Generic Name
Ibuprofen + Chlorzoxazone

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions.  It's particularly effective for treating muscle strains, sprains, and other injuries causing pain and stiffness. The ibuprofen component targets pain and inflammation, while the chlorzoxazone component acts as a muscle relaxant, helping to alleviate muscle spasms and stiffness. While not a primary indication, some doctors may prescribe it for short-term relief of back pain, although other treatment options are often preferred for this condition.  It's crucial to remember this medication is for short-term use only and isn't intended for chronic pain management.

### How it Works

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation. Chlorzoxazone, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, works in the central nervous system to reduce muscle spasms and stiffness.  The combination provides both pain relief and muscle relaxation, making it effective for musculoskeletal conditions.
