# Indium (In 111) Capromab Pendetide
### Generic Name
Indium (In 111) Capromab Pendetide

### Usage
Indium (In 111) capromab pendetide is a radiopharmaceutical used for diagnostic imaging, specifically in patients with prostate cancer. Its primary use is in newly diagnosed patients with biopsy-proven, clinically localized prostate cancer who are considered high-risk for pelvic lymph node metastases.  It's also used in post-prostatectomy patients with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, negative standard metastatic evaluation, but a strong clinical suspicion of metastatic disease.  The medication helps visualize potential spread of the cancer through imaging techniques.  It is *not* indicated for screening purposes or for assessing treatment response.

### Dosage
**Diagnostic Imaging (Adults):**  0.5 mg of capromab pendetide radiolabeled with 5 mCi of Indium 111 chloride is administered intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes.  A second dose may be given if necessary due to infiltration or inadequate imaging.  Prior to imaging sessions, bowel preparation (cathartic the evening before and cleansing enema 1 hour prior) and bladder catheterization/irrigation are usually required. The first imaging session is approximately 30 minutes post-infusion; the second is 72-120 hours post-infusion.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (incidence >1%):  Antibody development (immunologic).

Side effects with incidence between 1-10%: Hypertension, hypotension (cardiovascular), increased serum bilirubin level (hepatic).

Less common side effects (<1%): Burning sensation (thigh), dysgeusia (altered taste), dyspnea (shortness of breath), fever, headache, increased liver enzyme levels, injection site reactions, myalgia (muscle pain), pruritus (itching), skin rash, and weakness.

**Serious but less common side effects:** Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.

**Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Indium (In 111) capromab pendetide is an immunoconjugate. It consists of a monoclonal antibody (7E11-C5.3) linked to a chelating agent (GYK-DTPA-HCl) which binds Indium 111. This antibody specifically targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is found on prostate cells, both benign and cancerous.  The Indium 111 acts as a radioactive tracer, allowing visualization of PSMA-expressing cells via imaging techniques (like Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography or SPECT).  This helps identify areas where prostate cancer may have spread.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to Indium (In 111) capromab pendetide, other products of murine origin, Indium In 111 chloride, or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Development of human antimurine antibodies (HAMA) is also possible.  This medication interferes with certain antibody-based immunoassays (e.g., for PSA and digoxin), potentially causing falsely elevated results. It's crucial to inform your physician and lab personnel about your Indium (In 111) capromab pendetide use.  This medication is not for use in pregnant women.

**General Precautions:**  Appropriate handling and disposal procedures for radioactive materials are essential. Administration and imaging should be performed under the supervision of personnel trained in handling radioactive substances.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for the imaging to be performed?** A: Imaging is typically performed twice. The first session is about 30 minutes after the injection, and the second is 72 to 120 hours later.

* **Q: What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.

* **Q: Is Indium (In 111) capromab pendetide used for all types of prostate cancer?** A: No, it's used for specific scenarios of prostate cancer, primarily in high-risk patients with localized disease or those suspected of having metastatic disease after prostatectomy.

* **Q: Can this medicine be used to monitor treatment response?** A: No, Indium (In 111) capromab pendetide is not indicated for monitoring treatment response.

* **Q:  How is the medication stored?** A:  Storage and handling instructions are provided by the manufacturer and must be strictly adhered to due to the radioactive nature of the drug.  

* **Q: What are the implications of having human antimurine antibodies (HAMA)?** A: HAMA can interfere with certain blood tests, leading to inaccurate results. Your healthcare provider should be aware of your treatment with this medication to ensure accurate test interpretation.
