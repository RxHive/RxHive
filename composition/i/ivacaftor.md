# Ivacaftor
### Generic Name
Ivacaftor

### Usage
Ivacaftor is a medication used to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with specific genetic mutations.  Its primary use is in patients who have at least one mutation in the *CFTR* gene that responds to ivacaftor's potentiating effect.  This means the drug helps improve the function of a faulty protein (CFTR) involved in salt and water transport in the body. This faulty protein is the root cause of cystic fibrosis, leading to thick mucus buildup in the lungs and other organs.  Ivacaftor helps to improve the flow of chloride ions, helping to thin the mucus.  Secondary uses are not commonly defined for this drug, as its efficacy is highly dependent on the specific *CFTR* mutation present.  Determining responsiveness to the drug usually involves clinical and/or in vitro testing.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical adult dose for cystic fibrosis is 150 mg taken orally every 12 hours.

**Children:**  Dosing for children with cystic fibrosis varies greatly by age and weight:

* **Infants (4 to <6 months, ≥5 kg):** 25 mg granules every 12 hours.
* **Infants (≥6 months) and children (<6 years):** Dosage depends on weight:
    * 5 to <7 kg: 25 mg granules every 12 hours.
    * 7 to <14 kg: 50 mg granules every 12 hours.
    * ≥14 kg: 75 mg granules every 12 hours.
* **Children (≥6 years) and adolescents:** 150 mg tablet every 12 hours.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with liver impairment.  Those with mild impairment generally don't require adjustments, while those with moderate impairment may need a once-daily dose, and those with severe impairment may require even less frequent dosing or a careful assessment of risks and benefits.  Ivacaftor is generally not recommended for infants aged 4 to <6 months with any degree of hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) above 30 mL/minute.  However, caution is advised in patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Ivacaftor is available in tablet and granule forms.  Granules must be mixed with a soft food (excluding grapefruit) or liquid (excluding grapefruit juice) at or below room temperature and consumed within one hour.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Skin rash
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
* Upper respiratory tract infection

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Acne
* Increased blood sugar levels
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Bacterial infections
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Muscle pain (myalgia)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (frequency not always defined; post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Cataracts (in children)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity - monitor liver function tests)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator. CFTR is a protein that acts as a chloride channel in the cells of various organs, including the lungs.  In cystic fibrosis, mutations in the *CFTR* gene lead to a malfunctioning protein, resulting in thick mucus. Ivacaftor increases the function of certain mutated forms of the CFTR protein, thereby helping to restore proper chloride ion transport and reduce mucus viscosity. This leads to improved lung function and a reduction in the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.


### Precautions

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney problems; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ivacaftor can interact with other medications, especially those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase ivacaftor levels, while inducers can decrease them.  Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ivacaftor is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning animal studies have not shown harm, but human studies are lacking. Ivacaftor is excreted in breast milk; the decision to breastfeed during therapy should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, weighing the benefits and risks.
* **Grapefruit:** Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while taking ivacaftor, as they can interfere with its metabolism.
* **Ophthalmological Monitoring:** Regular eye exams are recommended for pediatric patients.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Ivacaftor?** A:  The onset and degree of improvement vary among individuals and depend on the specific *CFTR* mutation.  Some improvements in lung function may be seen relatively quickly, but the full effect may take longer.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Ivacaftor if I feel better?** A: No, do not stop taking Ivacaftor without consulting your doctor. Consistent treatment is essential for managing cystic fibrosis.

* **Q: How should I store Ivacaftor?** A: Store Ivacaftor as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: If less than 6 hours have passed since you were supposed to take it, take it as soon as possible with a fatty meal. If more than 6 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule. Do not double up on doses.

* **Q:  Is Ivacaftor a cure for cystic fibrosis?** A:  No, Ivacaftor is not a cure for cystic fibrosis, but it can significantly improve lung function and quality of life for patients with specific mutations in the CFTR gene.
