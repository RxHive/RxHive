# Isotretinoin (Topical)
### Generic Name
Isotretinoin (Topical)

### Usage
Isotretinoin topical is primarily used to treat mild to moderate acne vulgaris, whether or not it's inflamed.  It works by affecting how skin cells grow and shed, reducing the formation of acne lesions (pimples, blackheads, whiteheads).

### Dosage
**Acne Vulgaris (Mild to Moderate):**

* **Adults and Adolescents:** The usual dosage is Isotretinoin gel (0.05%). Apply a thin layer to the affected areas once or twice daily.  If irritation occurs, reduce the frequency of application or temporarily stop use until the irritation subsides, then resume the usual dosage.

**Important Considerations:**  The provided dosage information is a general guideline.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions and dosage recommendations, as they may vary based on individual needs and response to treatment.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning sensation, skin peeling (exfoliation), skin pain, stinging, dry skin (xeroderma), redness at the application site, irritation at the application site, itching at the application site, localized tenderness.

* **Less Common (but potentially serious):**  Hypopigmentation (loss of skin color), hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), and increased sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity).

**Important:** If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Isotretinoin is a retinoid, a derivative of Vitamin A.  Topically applied, it modifies the growth and maturation of skin cells. This multi-faceted action helps treat acne by:

* **Reducing sebum production:**  It helps to decrease the amount of oil produced by the skin, a key factor in acne development.
* **Preventing clogged pores:** It encourages the normal shedding of skin cells, preventing the blockage of pores that leads to pimples.
* **Reducing inflammation:** It has anti-inflammatory properties that help to calm irritated skin and reduce redness and swelling associated with acne.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Isotretinoin topical is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to isotretinoin or any of its components. It is also absolutely contraindicated in pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, and breastfeeding women.  It is a Category X drug in pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is significant.


* **Interactions:**  Avoid using isotretinoin topical with aminolevulinic acid (systemic).  Benzoyl peroxide may decrease the effectiveness of isotretinoin topical.  Isotretinoin topical may increase the effects of other medications, including topical and systemic aminolevulinic acid, topical erythromycin, porfimer, and verteporfin.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of skin cancer or a family history of skin cancer, or patients with rosacea or perioral dermatitis. It can cause irritation, particularly on sensitive skin areas. Patients with a history of intolerance to other topical retinoids should exercise caution.


* **Specific Populations:**  This medication is contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women.  Avoid use on sensitive areas, such as the neck, unless specifically directed by your physician.
