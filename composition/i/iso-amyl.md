# Iso Amyl
I cannot find a medication or substance with the generic name "Iso Amyl" that is commonly used in medicine.  "Isoamyl" refers to a chemical group (isoamyl alcohol) which is a component of some substances, but not a medication itself in the way that, for example, "Ibuprofen" or "Amoxicillin" are.  Isoamyl alcohol is found in some solvents and has some industrial applications, but it's not used therapeutically.


To provide you with the requested information, I need the correct and complete generic name of the medication.  Please provide the full and accurate name of the medicine you're interested in.  For example, if you meant Isoamyl nitrite, please specify it correctly.  Then I can provide you with the detailed information in the format requested.
