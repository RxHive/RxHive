# Indobufen
### Generic Name
Indobufen

### Usage
Indobufen is an antiplatelet medication primarily used to treat thrombosis (blood clot formation) associated with various conditions.  These include ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (affecting the heart and brain), peripheral vascular disease (affecting blood vessels in the limbs), and venous thromboembolism (blood clots in veins).  It's also used to prevent clot formation during extracorporeal circulation, such as in hemodialysis (kidney dialysis).  Essentially, Indobufen helps prevent blood clots from forming or growing larger, reducing the risk of serious complications from these conditions.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**

* **Thrombosis:** The typical oral dose is 100-200 mg twice daily (BID). For long-term treatment, a daily dose of 200 mg is often recommended.  The specific dosage will be determined by a physician based on the individual's condition and response to treatment.

* **Extracorporeal Circulation (e.g., Hemodialysis):**  A single oral dose of 100 mg is usually administered on hemodialysis days.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Indobufen in children haven't been established, and it's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment.  A healthcare professional should carefully assess the individual's needs.

* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):
    * CrCl > 80 mL/min: No dosage adjustment is needed.
    * CrCl 40-80 mL/min: 100 mg once daily (OD) or BID.
    * CrCl < 40 mL/min: 100 mg OD or every other day.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Gastrointestinal issues: Abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding gums.
* Dermatological reactions: Allergic skin reactions.
* Respiratory: Nosebleeds (epistaxis).

Less common but serious side effects are possible.  Any unusual or concerning side effect warrants immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Indobufen is an antiplatelet agent that works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes. This inhibition reduces the production of thromboxane B2, a substance that promotes platelet aggregation (clumping). By reducing thromboxane B2, Indobufen prevents platelets from sticking together and forming clots. It also affects other platelet functions, further reducing the risk of clot formation.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Indobufen is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Indobufen or any of its components.
* Congenital or acquired bleeding disorders.
* Active gastrointestinal ulcers or lesions.

**Warnings:**  Indobufen increases the risk of bleeding disorders and should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Diabetes
* A history of gastrointestinal lesions

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Indobufen should be avoided during pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.

**Drug Interactions:** Indobufen may increase the blood levels of glipizide (a diabetes medication).  Close monitoring is advised if both medications are used concurrently.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Indobufen with other medications?**
A: It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.

**Q: How should I store Indobufen?**
A: Follow the storage instructions on the medication label.  Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q:  When should I consult a doctor?**
A: Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual bleeding, bruising, severe stomach pain, allergic reactions, or other concerning side effects.
