# Influenza Virus Vaccine (Inactivated)
### Generic Name
Influenza Virus Vaccine (Inactivated)

### Usage
Influenza virus vaccine (inactivated) is a vaccine used to prevent influenza (the flu).  Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses.  The vaccine protects against the influenza A and B virus subtypes that are most likely to circulate during a specific influenza season.  The strains included in the vaccine are updated annually to match the predicted circulating strains.  This vaccine is used for active immunization, meaning it helps your body build its own immunity against the flu.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Influenza seasons vary, and early vaccination might not provide optimal protection throughout the entire season, particularly in older adults.  Vaccination should continue throughout the flu season as long as vaccine is available.  Vaccine formulations may differ between countries due to variations in recommended strains.  Age recommendations for vaccination may also vary by country.  Always consult your doctor or refer to your country's official health guidelines.

* **Adults (≤64 years and >64 years):** A single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose is recommended per influenza season.

* **Children (≥6 months):**  The dosage is 0.5 mL IM per dose. The number of doses needed per flu season depends on the child's age and vaccination history.  Children aged 6 months to 8 years may require two doses, depending on their prior vaccination status.  Children aged 9 years and older receive a single dose.  Consult your pediatrician for the appropriate schedule.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are specified by the manufacturer for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of recipients):**

* Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* Local: Pain, redness, swelling, tenderness, induration at the injection site
* Nervous System: Headache, fatigue, drowsiness, malaise, irritability (in children)
* Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Muscle aches (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia)
* Respiratory: Cough, runny nose (rhinorrhea), wheezing
* Other: Fever

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, serious side effects have been reported. These include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological events.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning reaction.


### How it Works

The inactivated influenza virus vaccine contains killed (inactivated) influenza viruses. When injected, this vaccine introduces these inactive viruses into the body.  This triggers the immune system to produce antibodies, which are proteins that specifically target and neutralize the influenza viruses.  This antibody response provides protection against future infection by the specific influenza strains contained in the vaccine.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** This vaccine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous influenza vaccine or any component of the vaccine formulation.

**Warnings/Precautions:**

* **Allergic Reactions:**  A small risk of allergic reactions exists.  Monitor patients for at least 15 minutes post-injection for signs of anaphylaxis.
* **Guillain-Barré Syndrome:**  A very rare association with Guillain-Barré syndrome (a neurological disorder) has been reported.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The inactivated influenza vaccine is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, always inform your healthcare provider about your pregnancy status.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:** Individuals with weakened immune systems may have a reduced response to the vaccine.  Consult a healthcare professional.
* **Egg Allergy:**  Most influenza vaccines are produced using eggs, so individuals with severe egg allergies should consult an allergist or healthcare provider before receiving the vaccine.
* **Other Medications:**  Some medications may interact with the vaccine, potentially reducing its effectiveness.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.
* **Injection Site Reactions:**  Pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site are common, but serious local reactions can occur rarely.


### FAQs

* **Q: How effective is the influenza vaccine?** A: Effectiveness varies year to year depending on the match between the vaccine strains and circulating viruses.  However, it significantly reduces your risk of getting the flu and experiencing severe complications.

* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A: Protection generally lasts for one influenza season.  Annual vaccination is recommended.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Most side effects are mild and resolve on their own.  However, contact your healthcare provider if you experience severe or concerning side effects, such as difficulty breathing, severe allergic reactions, or neurological symptoms.

* **Q: Can I get the flu from the inactivated influenza vaccine?** A: No. The inactivated vaccine contains killed viruses and cannot cause the flu.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A: Store the vaccine as directed by the manufacturer, typically at a refrigerated temperature.
