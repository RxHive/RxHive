# Ibrexafungerp
### Generic Name
Ibrexafungerp

### Usage
Ibrexafungerp is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), also known as a yeast infection, in adult and post-menarchal (after the first menstrual period) females.  It's specifically designed to target the *Candida* species of fungus responsible for these infections.  Currently, it does not hold approval for other fungal infections.

### Dosage

**Vulvovaginal Candidiasis:**

* **Adults and Postmenarchal Females:** The standard oral dosage is 300 mg every 12 hours for a total of two doses (600 mg total daily dose).  It's crucial to follow the prescribed regimen strictly.  If a fungal culture was taken before treatment, adjust the medication based on the results.


* **Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Ibrexafungerp have not been established in pre-menarchal girls.  For postmenarchal children and adolescents, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended by the manufacturer for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

**Concomitant Use with CYP3A Inhibitors:** If taken with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, the Ibrexafungerp dosage should be reduced to 150 mg every 12 hours for one day only.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for concomitant use with weak or moderate CYP3A inhibitors.  Consult your doctor if you are unsure.



### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Flatulence
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)
* Vaginal hemorrhage
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (serum transaminases)
* Back pain
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

If you experience any serious or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ibrexafungerp is a triterpenoid antifungal drug. It works by inhibiting glucan synthase, an enzyme crucial for the creation of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, a vital component of the fungal cell wall. By interfering with cell wall formation, Ibrexafungerp prevents the fungus from growing and ultimately kills it (fungicidal activity). This mechanism of action is particularly effective against *Candida* species.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Ibrexafungerp is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential for fetal harm.  Pregnancy testing is required before treatment initiation.  Effective contraception should be used during and for four days after treatment.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown whether Ibrexafungerp is excreted in breast milk.  The benefits of breastfeeding should be carefully weighed against the potential risks to the infant.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with known hypersensitivity to Ibrexafungerp or any component of the formulation should avoid using this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors may increase Ibrexafungerp levels, requiring a dosage adjustment. Conversely, strong or moderate CYP3A inducers may decrease Ibrexafungerp levels and should be avoided.  Consult your doctor about any medications you are taking before starting Ibrexafungerp.
