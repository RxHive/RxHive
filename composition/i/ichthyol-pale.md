Ichthammol (Pale)

### Usage
Ichthammol pale, also known as ammonium ichthosulfonate, is a topical medication primarily used for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.  Its main application is in treating various dermatological conditions characterized by inflammation and infection.  This includes:

* **Acne vulgaris:**  It can help reduce inflammation and promote healing of acne lesions.
* **Eczema:** Ichthammol can soothe irritated skin and reduce itching associated with eczema.
* **Psoriasis:** While not a primary treatment, it may offer some relief from itching and inflammation in mild cases of psoriasis.
* **Burns (minor):**  It can aid in the healing process of minor burns by promoting tissue regeneration and reducing inflammation.
* **Skin infections:** Its antiseptic properties help control bacterial and fungal infections of the skin.


It's important to note that Ichthammol pale is not a cure-all for these conditions, and its effectiveness may vary depending on the severity and individual response.  It's often used as an adjunct therapy alongside other treatments recommended by a dermatologist.


### Dosage
Ichthammol pale is available in various topical formulations like ointments, creams, and pastes. Dosage is determined by the specific condition being treated and the formulation used.  There's no standardized dosage across all conditions.  

* **Application:**  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the affected area one to three times daily.  The exact amount and frequency should be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be under the strict supervision of a physician.  The dosage should be adjusted based on the child's age and the affected skin surface area.
