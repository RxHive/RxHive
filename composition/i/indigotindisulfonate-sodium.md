# Indigotindisulfonate sodium
### Generic Name
Indigotindisulfonate sodium

### Usage
Indigotindisulfonate sodium is a diagnostic dye used primarily as a visualization aid during cystoscopy.  Cystoscopy is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into the urethra to examine the bladder and urethra.  In this context, indigotindisulfonate sodium helps doctors visualize the ureters (tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder) after urological or gynecological surgeries (open, robotic, or endoscopic). The dye's deep blue color allows for clear identification of any potential leaks or damage to the ureters.  It is crucial to remember that indigotindisulfonate sodium is a diagnostic tool and does not treat any underlying medical condition.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The typical adult dose is 5 mL administered intravenously over one minute.  The blue coloration at the ureteral orifices is typically visible within 4-9 minutes post-injection.  Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm is essential during and after administration.  The injection should be stopped immediately if any adverse reaction occurs.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of indigotindisulfonate sodium in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (based on manufacturer's labeling).  For patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min), the use of indigotindisulfonate sodium is not recommended as its safety and efficacy haven't been studied in this population.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* Renal: Dysuria (painful urination)
* Other: Fever (pyrexia), increased ALT (liver enzyme) levels


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (Postmarketing reports):**

* Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, asystole (absence of heartbeat), second-degree atrioventricular block, hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia (slow heart rate), tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Allergic/Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic reactions (including hypotension, dyspnea [shortness of breath], bronchospasm, urticaria [hives], and erythema [redness])
* Other: Injection site discoloration


**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, immediately discontinue use and seek medical attention.

### How it Works
Indigotindisulfonate sodium is a dye that is excreted by the kidneys through tubular secretion.  Its deep blue color allows for easy visualization of the ureteral orifices during cystoscopy, enabling surgeons to assess their integrity and identify any potential leaks or damage.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Indigotindisulfonate sodium is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity or allergy to indigotindisulfonate or any components of the formulation.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of cardiovascular reactions (including those listed in the side effects section) and hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis).  Careful monitoring is essential.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  While available data haven't shown a drug-associated risk of adverse maternal or fetal effects, data from the first trimester is limited.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, but transfer is likely low, and adverse effects on the infant are not expected.  However, the benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against potential risks.

**General Precautions:** The intravenous injection should be administered over one minute.  The solution should be used immediately after opening the ampule.  Do not administer with other intravenous solutions or drugs.  Indigotindisulfonate sodium may cause transient interference with pulse oximetry readings and may temporarily discolor the injection site and urine (blue). The discoloration should resolve within 48 hours.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does the blue discoloration from the dye last?**
A: The blue discoloration of the urine and injection site usually resolves within 48 hours.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Stop using the medication immediately and contact your healthcare provider.

**Q: Can I use indigotindisulfonate sodium if I have kidney problems?**
A:  Use is not recommended for patients with severe kidney impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min). Consult your doctor.

**Q: Is indigotindisulfonate sodium safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**
A:  While generally considered safe, consult your doctor to assess the risks and benefits during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

**Q: How is indigotindisulfonate sodium administered?**
A: It is administered intravenously over one minute.

**Q: How is indigotindisulfonate sodium stored?**
A: Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product label.  Generally, medication should be stored according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
