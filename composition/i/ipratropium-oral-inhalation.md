# Ipratropium (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Ipratropium (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Ipratropium is an anticholinergic bronchodilator primarily used for the maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), encompassing conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe.  Importantly, ipratropium is *not* intended for immediate relief of acute bronchospasm; it's a maintenance medication, not a rescue inhaler for sudden breathing difficulties.  While not its primary indication, ipratropium is sometimes used off-label in combination with a short-acting beta-agonist to treat acute exacerbations of asthma.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **COPD:**
    * **Metered-dose inhaler (MDI):** 2 inhalations (34 mcg) four times daily (QID). The maximum daily dose is 12 inhalations (204 mcg).
    * **Nebulization solution:** 0.5 mg (500 mcg) every 6-8 hours.

* **Acute Asthma Exacerbation (off-label):**  *Always used in combination with a short-acting beta-agonist.*
    * **MDI:** 8 inhalations (136 mcg) every 20 minutes, as needed, for up to 3 hours.
    * **Nebulization solution:** 0.5 mg (500 mcg) every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then as needed.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly by age and condition, and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  See a doctor for specific guidance.  Generally, lower doses are used for children than for adults, and nebulization is often preferred for younger children.  Off-label use in children for asthma exacerbations often involves lower doses administered via MDI or nebulization.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for hepatic or renal impairment, but this should be discussed with a physician.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Cough
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Nausea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
*  Bronchitis
* Exacerbation of COPD
* Sinusitis

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)
* Glaucoma (increased eye pressure)
* Urinary retention
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Ipratropium is an anticholinergic drug.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the muscles in the airways to constrict. By blocking acetylcholine, ipratropium prevents airway narrowing, leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways) and making breathing easier.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ipratropium is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to ipratropium, atropine, or any component of the formulation.
* **Interactions:** Ipratropium may interact with other medications, particularly other anticholinergic drugs. Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), or bladder neck obstruction.  Ipratropium should be used cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women.  The safety and effectiveness in children under 12 years old are not fully established for all indications.
* **Paradoxical Bronchospasm:**  In rare cases, ipratropium can cause paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing). This is more likely to occur in patients with severe asthma.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I use ipratropium to treat a sudden asthma attack?**
**A:** No, ipratropium is not a rescue inhaler. It's for the long-term maintenance of COPD symptoms. Use a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler for sudden breathing problems.

**Q: How should I store ipratropium?**
**A:** Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
**A:** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

**Q:  Can I use ipratropium if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**
**A:**  Consult your doctor before using ipratropium during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.

**Q:  How long does it take to work?**
**A:** The onset of action varies depending on the administration route (MDI vs. nebulizer).  Improvement in breathing should be noticeable within a short time (minutes to an hour),  but the full therapeutic benefit may not be seen for several days or weeks of consistent use.
