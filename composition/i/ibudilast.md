# Ibudilast
### Generic Name
Ibudilast

### Usage
Ibudilast is primarily used for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.  It's not a rescue medication for acute asthma attacks; rather, it's intended to help manage the underlying condition over time.  A secondary use is to improve dizziness in patients with chronic cerebral insufficiency, specifically those who have experienced a previous cerebral infarction (stroke).  It's important to note that ibudilast's effectiveness in these conditions may not be apparent immediately; it usually takes several weeks of consistent use to see benefits.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Asthma:** The typical dosage is 10 mg twice daily (BID). It's crucial to understand that ibudilast is not for immediate relief of acute asthma symptoms.  It typically takes 4-6 weeks to assess its effectiveness in managing chronic asthma.
* **Post-stroke Dizziness:** The usual dosage is 10 mg three times daily (TID).  The doctor may adjust the dosage based on the patient's response.  If no improvement is observed after 12 weeks, the treatment may be discontinued.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of ibudilast in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works

Ibudilast is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor.  While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed to work by affecting multiple pathways in the body. It's thought to influence blood vessel dilation (widening), inhibiting platelet aggregation (clumping), and potentially modulating inflammatory responses.  These effects may contribute to its efficacy in managing chronic asthma and post-stroke dizziness.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to ibudilast or any of its ingredients.
* Active intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain).

**Warnings:**

* Ibudilast may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).  Regular monitoring of liver function and blood counts is often recommended.
* Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment or in the acute phase of cerebral infarction (stroke).
* Not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to unknown risks to the fetus or infant.
