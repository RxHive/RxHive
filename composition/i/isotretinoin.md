# Isotretinoin

**Generic Name:** Isotretinoin

**Usage:** Isotretinoin is primarily used to treat severe acne (nodular acne or acne unresponsive to other treatments), including acne that causes scarring. It's also sometimes used for other skin conditions like severe rosacea and certain types of skin cancers (under the guidance of a specialist).  It is a potent medication and should only be used under strict medical supervision.

**Side Effects:** Isotretinoin has a wide range of potential side effects, some mild and some serious.  These can vary greatly from person to person.  Common side effects include:

* **Dryness:** Extremely dry skin, lips, eyes, and mucous membranes (nose, mouth).
* **Skin irritation:** Redness, itching, peeling.
* **Muscle aches:** Joint pain or stiffness.
* **Nosebleeds:**
* **Headache:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Depression:** (a serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention)
* **Increased risk of infection:** due to dry skin and mucous membranes.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:** (requires monitoring through blood tests)
* **Increased cholesterol and triglycerides:** (requires monitoring through blood tests)
* **Vision changes:** (blurry vision, night blindness)


**Serious side effects (requiring immediate medical attention):**

* **Intolerance to contact lenses**
* **Severe depression or suicidal thoughts**
* **Pancreatitis** (inflammation of the pancreas)
* **Inflammatory bowel disease**
* **Pseudotumor cerebri** (increased intracranial pressure)
* **Severe allergic reactions**


**How it Works:** Isotretinoin works by reducing the size and activity of the sebaceous glands (oil glands) in the skin. This leads to a significant decrease in sebum production, which is a major contributor to acne. It also reduces inflammation and helps prevent the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads).  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it involves interfering with the cell growth and differentiation process in the sebaceous glands.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Isotretinoin safe?** Isotretinoin is a powerful medication with potential side effects. It's crucial to be under strict medical supervision while taking it. Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor liver function and lipid levels.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Isotretinoin?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage, so it's generally recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while on isotretinoin.
* **Can I get pregnant while taking Isotretinoin?**  Isotretinoin is extremely teratogenic (causes severe birth defects).  Women of childbearing age must use two forms of effective contraception for one month *before*, during, and one month *after* treatment.  Pregnancy tests are usually required before starting and during treatment.
* **How long does it take to see results?**  Improvements in acne usually begin to appear within a few weeks, but the full benefit may not be seen for several months.  The course of treatment is typically several months long.
* **What happens if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Can I stop taking Isotretinoin when my acne clears up?**  No,  you must complete the full course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if your acne improves. Stopping early can lead to a relapse.
* **What are the long-term effects of Isotretinoin?**  Most side effects are temporary and resolve after treatment is stopped. However, some individuals may experience long-term dryness or changes in their skin's sensitivity.  The risk of depression and inflammatory bowel disease may persist even after the medication is discontinued.
