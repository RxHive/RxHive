# Influenza Virus Vaccine (Adjuvanted)
### Generic Name
Influenza Virus Vaccine (Adjuvanted)

### Usage
This inactivated influenza vaccine is used to actively immunize against influenza (the flu) caused by influenza A and B virus subtypes included in the specific vaccine formulation.  It's designed to prevent the flu, not treat it once you've already contracted the illness.  The specific strains included in the vaccine are updated annually to match the most prevalent strains expected to circulate during the upcoming flu season.

### Dosage
**Adults:** A single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection is recommended.  The injection should ideally be given in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm; the gluteal region is less preferred.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of this particular adjuvanted influenza vaccine have not been established in children.  Different influenza vaccines are available for pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide dosage adjustments for individuals with renal or hepatic (liver) impairment.  Consult a healthcare provider for specific guidance in these cases.

### How it Works
The trivalent influenza vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the influenza viruses included in the vaccine. This antibody response helps protect against infection by those specific strains of the virus. The "adjuvanted" aspect refers to the inclusion of an adjuvant, a substance that enhances the immune response to the vaccine.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with:

*   Immunosuppression (weakened immune system)
*   Moderate or severe illness


**Warnings:** This vaccine increases the risk of:

*   Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder)
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Syncope (fainting)
*   Oculorespiratory syndrome (a rare condition involving eye and respiratory problems)
*   Mild illness
*   Febrile seizures (fevers causing seizures)


**Cautions:** Use with caution in individuals with:

*   Bleeding disorders
*   A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome


**Other considerations:** If the vaccine is given concurrently with other injectable vaccines, they should be administered at different injection sites.  Immunosuppressive or corticosteroid therapies may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness; concurrent use should be avoided.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does the protection from this vaccine last?**  A: Protection generally lasts for one flu season.  Annual vaccination is recommended.

*   **Q: What should I do if I faint after receiving the vaccine?**  A: Lie down immediately.  If seizure-like activity occurs, remain in a supine or Trendelenburg position (head lower than feet) to improve cerebral blood flow.

*   **Q: Can I get the flu from this vaccine?** A: No. This is an inactivated (killed) virus vaccine and cannot cause influenza.  You may experience some mild side effects, but these are generally short-lived.

*   **Q: How is the vaccine stored?**  A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Generally, this involves refrigeration.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?**  A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency.
