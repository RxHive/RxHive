# Isosorbide Solution (Oral)
### Generic Name
Isosorbide Solution (Oral)

### Usage
Isosorbide solution is primarily an osmotic diuretic used to reduce elevated pressure in several conditions. Its main uses include:

* **Meniere's disease:** This inner ear disorder causes vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and hearing loss. Isosorbide helps manage these symptoms by reducing fluid pressure in the inner ear.

* **Increased intracranial pressure:** This condition, often associated with brain tumors or head trauma, involves dangerously high pressure within the skull. Isosorbide helps lower this pressure by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the bloodstream.

* **Acute angle-closure glaucoma:** This is a serious eye condition where fluid buildup increases pressure inside the eye. Isosorbide provides short-term pressure reduction, often used before or after eye surgery.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's individual characteristics.  Always follow your doctor's prescription exactly.  The following are general examples and should not be considered a substitute for medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Increased intracranial pressure:** 49-98 grams per day (70-140 mL), divided into 2-3 doses.
* **Meniere's disease:** 63-84 grams per day (90-120 mL), divided into 3 doses.  A recommended standard dose is 1.05-1.4 g/kg/day (1.5-2 mL/kg/day).
* **Acute angle-closure glaucoma:** 1-3 g/kg twice daily (BID).

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of isosorbide solution in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Administration:**  The solution is usually administered orally.  It's often recommended to dilute the solution with twice its volume of water before taking it.  This makes it easier to swallow.  Following a meal often helps to reduce potential gastrointestinal side effects.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment, and it's contraindicated in patients with anuria (absence of urine production).

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Thirst
* Lethargy
* Vertigo
* Syncope (fainting)
* Confusion
* Disorientation
* Irritability
* Insomnia
* Hiccups
* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood)
* Hyperosmolality (high concentration of dissolved substances in the blood)

Less common, but more serious, side effects may occur.  It is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as severe dehydration, significant changes in blood pressure, or worsening of the underlying condition.


### How it Works

Isosorbide is an osmotic diuretic.  This means it increases the osmotic pressure of the blood, drawing fluid from tissues (such as the brain or eye) into the bloodstream.  This fluid is then eliminated through the kidneys, resulting in a reduction of pressure in the affected area.  In the case of Meniere's disease, this reduction in inner ear fluid pressure alleviates symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Isosorbide solution is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to isosorbide, acute intracranial hematoma, severe decompensated heart failure, severe renal disease, anuria, severe dehydration, frank or impending pulmonary edema, hemorrhagic glaucoma, sodium retention, and it should never be administered parenterally (by injection).
* **Interactions:**  Isosorbide can interact with various medications, notably vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.  These interactions can lead to increased hypotension (low blood pressure) or altered effectiveness of other drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking before starting isosorbide.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Isosorbide is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution should be exercised if administered to a nursing mother.
* **Elderly Patients and Patients with Compromised Renal or Hepatic Function:**  Use caution in elderly patients and those with reduced kidney or liver function.  Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take isosorbide with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before starting isosorbide to avoid potential drug interactions.

* **Q: How should I store isosorbide solution?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking isosorbide suddenly?** A:  No, always follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping the medication.  Sudden cessation may lead to a rebound effect.

* **Q:  What are the signs of dehydration while on isosorbide?** A:  Watch for symptoms like excessive thirst, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased urination, and fatigue.  Report these to your doctor immediately.
