# Isosorbide Dinitrate

**Generic Name:** Isosorbide Dinitrate

**Usage:**

Isosorbide dinitrate is used to prevent angina (chest pain) in people with coronary artery disease.  It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow to the heart.  It's often prescribed to be taken regularly, throughout the day, to prevent angina attacks rather than to treat them as they occur.  It can be used in both short-acting (to treat an attack) and long-acting forms, although the long-acting forms are more common for preventative use.  It may also be used to treat other conditions as directed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of isosorbide dinitrate include:

* **Headache:** This is a very common side effect, often mild and resolving over time.
* **Dizziness:** Can be due to lowered blood pressure.
* **Lightheadedness:** Similar to dizziness, often related to postural hypotension.
* **Flushing:** Feeling of warmth in the face and neck.
* **Nausea:** Feeling of sickness.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, leading to dizziness or fainting.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Severe hypotension:** Very low blood pressure.
* **Syncope (fainting):** Loss of consciousness.
* **Reflex tachycardia:** Increased heart rate in response to low blood pressure.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling.

**How it Works:**

Isosorbide dinitrate is a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes and widens blood vessels. This widening reduces the workload on the heart and allows more blood to flow to the heart muscle, relieving chest pain.  It achieves this by releasing nitric oxide, which causes smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessel walls.  This effect is particularly pronounced in veins, leading to reduced venous return to the heart.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take isosorbide dinitrate as needed for chest pain?**  While there are short-acting forms,  long-acting isosorbide dinitrate is typically *not* taken as needed for acute angina attacks.  It's usually prescribed for preventative daily use.  For acute angina attacks, other medications like nitroglycerin are usually prescribed.

* **What should I do if I get a headache?**  Mild headaches are common.  Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) may help.  If headaches are severe or persistent, contact your doctor.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking isosorbide dinitrate?** Alcohol can worsen the blood pressure-lowering effects of isosorbide dinitrate, increasing the risk of dizziness and fainting.  Limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **What should I do if I experience dizziness or lightheadedness?** Sit or lie down immediately to prevent fainting.  This medication can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing positions (orthostatic hypotension).

* **Should I stop taking isosorbide dinitrate suddenly?**  No. Stopping suddenly can lead to rebound angina, a worsening of chest pain.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and discontinuation.

* **Does isosorbide dinitrate interact with other medications?** Yes, it can interact with several medications, including other nitrates, erectile dysfunction medications, and some blood pressure medications.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
