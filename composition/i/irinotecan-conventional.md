# Irinotecan (Conventional)
### Generic Name
Irinotecan (Conventional)

### Usage

Irinotecan (conventional) is a chemotherapy drug primarily used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer.  Its main application is in combination with other drugs like fluorouracil and leucovorin, either as a first-line treatment or after initial fluorouracil-based therapy has failed and the cancer has returned.  While primarily used for colorectal cancer, irinotecan also sees off-label use in treating various other cancers, including (but not limited to): Ewing sarcoma, gastric cancer, cervical cancer, glioblastoma (a type of brain tumor), esophageal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and small cell lung cancer.  The specific dosage and combination regimens vary significantly depending on the cancer type and its stage.  It's crucial to understand that off-label use implies the treatment is not officially approved for that specific condition by regulatory bodies.

### Dosage

Irinotecan dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors: the specific cancer being treated, the patient's body surface area (BSA),  the presence of other medical conditions (particularly liver and kidney function), and the patient's response to the treatment.  There's no single "standard" dose.  Always refer to the prescribing information and consult with an oncologist for personalized dosage guidance.  Dosing is typically given intravenously (IV) over a period of time, usually 90 minutes.  

**Examples of dosing regimens (Note: These are examples only.  Actual dosing will be determined by your doctor):**

* **Metastatic colorectal cancer (single-agent):**  May range from 100 mg/m² to 350 mg/m² administered weekly or every three weeks.
* **Metastatic colorectal cancer (combination therapy):** Often involves doses of 125 mg/m² to 180 mg/m² given multiple times within a 6-week cycle, in conjunction with other chemotherapy agents.
* **Other cancers (off-label use):** Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific cancer type and other factors,  and will be tailored by the oncologist.  For example, in some off-label uses, the dose might be 60-200 mg/m² given over several days/weeks within a treatment cycle.

**Pediatric dosing:**  Irinotecan is used in children with certain cancers, but the dosage and regimen are vastly different from adult regimens, generally involving significantly lower doses adjusted by body surface area.

**Important note:**  Irinotecan (conventional) and irinotecan liposomal are *not* interchangeable.  They have different dosing requirements.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea (can be severe and even life-threatening)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Fatigue
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Low white blood cell count (neutropenia) – increasing risk of infection
* Low red blood cell count (anemia)
* Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Abdominal pain
* Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes)
* Cholinergic effects (sweating, increased salivation, blurry vision, etc.)

**Less common, but serious side effects:**

* Severe neutropenic fever (requiring immediate medical attention)
* Severe dehydration due to diarrhea
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Heart problems
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems
* Pulmonary toxicity (lung damage)
* Bowel inflammation (colitis) or perforation (a hole in the bowel)


If you experience any side effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, it is crucial to contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.  Topoisomerase I is an enzyme that helps manage the unwinding and rewinding of DNA during cell replication.  Irinotecan and its active metabolite (SN-38) interfere with this enzyme's function, leading to DNA damage and ultimately cell death.  This effect is particularly pronounced in rapidly dividing cancer cells, making it an effective chemotherapy agent.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Irinotecan is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary in patients with moderate to severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** While not explicitly stated in the manufacturer's labeling, caution is advised and dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with kidney problems.  Your doctor will tailor the dose.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  Irinotecan can cause significant bone marrow suppression, increasing the risk of infections and bleeding.  Regular blood tests to monitor blood counts are essential.
* **Diarrhea:**  Diarrhea is a common and potentially severe side effect.  Prompt treatment with antidiarrheal medication is crucial, and the dose may need to be reduced or stopped.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Irinotecan's metabolism can be affected by other medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specifically, interactions exist with strong CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Irinotecan is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Effective contraception is mandatory for both men and women during treatment and for several months after.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated during and after treatment.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults with other health issues may be more sensitive to irinotecan's side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I be on irinotecan?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the type and stage of cancer, your response to therapy, and any side effects.  Your oncologist will determine the treatment plan.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe diarrhea?** A: Contact your doctor immediately.  Severe diarrhea can be a life-threatening side effect.  Specific antidiarrheal medication will be recommended, and the dose may be adjusted or treatment stopped.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking irinotecan?** A:  This depends on your individual response to the medication.  Fatigue and other side effects can impair your ability to drive safely. Follow your doctor's advice.

* **Q: How should I store irinotecan?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Generally, this will be at a controlled temperature.
