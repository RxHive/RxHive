# Iodamide
### Generic Name
Iodipamide

### Usage
Iodipamide is a water-soluble, iodinated contrast medium primarily used in intravenous cholangiography and cholecystography.  These procedures involve visualizing the bile ducts (cholangiography) and gallbladder (cholecystography) using X-rays. The iodine in iodipamide makes these structures visible on the X-ray images, allowing doctors to assess their structure and function, helping diagnose conditions like gallstones, tumors, or bile duct obstructions.

### Dosage

**Cholecystography and Cholangiography (Intravenous):**

* **Adults:** 20 mL administered intravenously slowly over 10 minutes.  The dose should not be repeated within 24 hours.
* **Children:** 3-0.6 mL/kg of body weight administered intravenously slowly over 10 minutes. The maximum dose is 20 mL.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided information does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosing in patients with compromised liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

* Restlessness
* Sensations of warmth
* Sneezing
* Perspiration
* Salivation
* Flushing
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Renal failure (in rare cases)

**Important Note:** This list may not include all possible side effects.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Iodipamide is an iodinated contrast agent.  After intravenous administration, it's taken up by the liver and secreted into the bile. This concentration of iodine in the bile allows the bile ducts and gallbladder to be visualized using X-rays.  The iodine atoms absorb X-rays, creating a shadow on the image that outlines these structures.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Iodipamide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to any iodinated substance or any other component of the formulation.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when administering iodipamide to patients with sickle-cell disease or severe hypertension (high blood pressure).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Iodipamide is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; use during breastfeeding should be approached cautiously and only after careful consideration by a healthcare professional.

### FAQs

**Q: What is a low-residue diet?**

A: A low-residue diet restricts foods that produce a lot of fiber or waste. It's sometimes recommended before procedures like cholecystography to improve visualization.

**Q: What happens if I have an allergic reaction?**

A: Allergic reactions to iodipamide can range from mild to severe.  Mild reactions might include flushing or itching. Severe reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.

**Q: How is iodipamide stored?**

A: Refer to the specific product labeling for detailed storage instructions.  Generally, medications should be stored at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Can I drive after receiving iodipamide?**

A:  Some side effects, such as hypotension, might impair your ability to drive.  Follow your doctor's advice regarding driving or operating machinery after receiving iodipamide.
