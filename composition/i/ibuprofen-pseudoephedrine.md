# Ibuprofen + Pseudoephedrine
### Generic Name
Ibuprofen + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage

This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, or sinusitis.  Ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), targets pain and fever.  Pseudoephedrine, a decongestant, reduces nasal congestion by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.  This makes it effective for relieving symptoms such as headache, muscle aches, fever, and stuffy nose.  It's important to note that this combination doesn't treat the underlying cause of illness but focuses on symptom relief.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary depending on age, weight, and the severity of symptoms.  Always follow the instructions on the label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.

**Oral:**  Typical adult doses might include one or two tablets or capsules every four to six hours as needed, but never exceeding the maximum daily dose specified on the product label.  Children's dosages are significantly lower and must be carefully determined based on weight and age, often using liquid formulations.  Do not give this medication to children without consulting a doctor.

**IV:**  This combination is not available in intravenous (IV) form.  Ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine are typically administered orally.

### How it Works

Ibuprofen works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  Pseudoephedrine acts as a sympathomimetic amine, meaning it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. This causes the blood vessels in the nasal passages to constrict, reducing swelling and relieving congestion.  The combination offers dual action for relieving both pain/fever and nasal congestion.
