# Ibuprofen + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Ibuprofen + Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, allergies, or other respiratory illnesses.  Ibuprofen reduces fever and relieves mild to moderate pain, while pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that helps relieve stuffy nose and sinus congestion.  It's typically used for short-term relief, not for long-term treatment of underlying conditions.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the label or as directed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Ibuprofen related:** Stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, headache, drowsiness.  More serious, though rare, side effects include allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), kidney problems, and stomach ulcers.
* **Pseudoephedrine related:** Nervousness, dizziness, insomnia, headache, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, difficulty urinating.  More serious, though rare, side effects include stroke and heart attack (especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions).

**How it Works:**

* **Ibuprofen:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. It also reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates body temperature.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a sympathomimetic amine. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. This allows for easier breathing.
