# Icatibant
### Generic Name
Icatibant

### Usage
Icatibant is primarily used to treat acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults aged 18 years and older. HAE is a rare genetic disorder causing episodes of severe swelling, primarily affecting the face, extremities, genitals, and airway.  Icatibant's primary mechanism is to quickly alleviate these swelling episodes.  While not officially approved for this, it's also sometimes used off-label to treat severe or life-threatening angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors (medications used to treat high blood pressure).  This off-label use requires careful medical supervision.

### Dosage
**Hereditary Angioedema (HAE):** The typical adult dose is 30 mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin) in the abdomen.  This can be repeated every 6 hours if symptoms persist or return, but the total daily dose should not exceed 90 mg (three injections).

**ACE Inhibitor-Induced Angioedema (Off-label):**  For severe or life-threatening angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors, the initial dose is 30 mg subcutaneously. A second 30 mg dose may be given after 6 hours if symptoms worsen, along with intravenous prednisolone.  Early administration (within the first few hours of an attack) is crucial for optimal effectiveness.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Icatibant's safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 18.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Dizziness

**Less Common but Important Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Skin rash
* Increased serum transaminase levels (liver enzyme elevation)
* Fever
* Development of antibodies to icatibant
* Urticaria (hives) â€“ reported post-marketing


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Icatibant is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.  In HAE, a lack of C1 esterase inhibitor leads to an excessive buildup of bradykinin, a molecule that triggers inflammation and swelling. Icatibant works by blocking bradykinin from binding to its B2 receptor, thereby preventing the inflammatory cascade and reducing swelling.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Icatibant is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to icatibant acetate or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:** Icatibant should be used cautiously in breastfeeding women.  Patients should be aware of the potential for increased risk of airway obstruction or central nervous system (CNS) depression, potentially impairing physical or mental abilities.  Use caution when performing tasks requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.

**Drug Interactions:** Icatibant might reduce the blood pressure-lowering effects of ACE inhibitors.
