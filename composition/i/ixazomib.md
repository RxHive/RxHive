# Ixazomib
### Generic Name
Ixazomib

### Usage

Ixazomib is a medication primarily used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer affecting plasma cells in the bone marrow.  It's specifically indicated for patients who have already received at least one prior therapy.  Ixazomib is always used in combination with other drugs, most commonly lenalidomide and dexamethasone, to maximize its effectiveness.  While not FDA-approved for other conditions,  it's sometimes used off-label in various combinations with other agents for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, or even in newly diagnosed patients ineligible for stem cell transplant.  These off-label uses require careful consideration by a hematologist/oncologist due to varying dosing and combination regimens.

### Dosage

Ixazomib is administered orally.  The standard dosage for multiple myeloma patients (who have received at least one prior therapy and are receiving it in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone) is 4 mg once a week on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.  Lenalidomide and dexamethasone doses are given concurrently but at different schedules and doses which are outlined in the product information.  

Dosage adjustments are crucial and are based on several factors, including pre-existing or treatment-emergent hepatic and renal impairment, and the occurrence of adverse effects like hematologic toxicities (low blood cell counts), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), or other side effects. For example, reduced renal function may necessitate a lower starting dose of 3 mg. If side effects occur, dosage reduction or temporary treatment interruption might be necessary.  Always consult the complete prescribing information for precise adjustments based on specific situations and patient characteristics.  Dosage and regimens for off-label uses of Ixazomib vary considerably and need to be determined by an oncologist.  There is no established pediatric dosage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness, pain in the extremities)
*   Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
*   Constipation
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Skin rash
*   Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
*   Back pain
*   Eye problems


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Thrombotic microangiopathy (blood clots in small blood vessels)
*   Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Sweet syndrome)
*   Severe neurological issues (reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, transverse myelitis)

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ixazomib is a proteasome inhibitor.  Proteasomes are protein complexes within cells that break down other proteins.  By inhibiting the proteasome, Ixazomib prevents the degradation of certain proteins that trigger cell death (apoptosis) in myeloma cells. This ultimately leads to the death of cancerous plasma cells, helping to control the disease.

### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Ixazomib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with pre-existing or treatment-related liver or kidney problems.
*   **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Ixazomib can suppress bone marrow function, increasing the risk of infections and bleeding. Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor blood cell counts.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ixazomib is harmful to a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for 90 days after the final dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 90 days after the last dose.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Ixazomib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme system.  Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking.
*   **Older Adults:** Older adults may be at increased risk for certain side effects, requiring close monitoring.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I take Ixazomib?** A: Swallow the capsule whole with water at least one hour before or two hours after a meal. Take it on the same day of the week at approximately the same time each week.  Do not crush, chew, or open the capsule.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose only if the next scheduled dose is at least 72 hours away. Do not take a double dose.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms.

*   **Q: How is Ixazomib stored?** A: Store Ixazomib capsules at room temperature and protect them from moisture.

*   **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Ixazomib?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor, as it can potentially interact with other medications you may be taking concurrently.
