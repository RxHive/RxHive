# Insulin detemir

**Generic Name:** Insulin detemir

**Usage:**

Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analog used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's administered subcutaneously (under the skin) usually once or twice daily.  The specific dosing and administration schedule will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and blood glucose monitoring.  It's often used in combination with other insulins or oral hypoglycemic agents.  The goal is to help control blood sugar levels by mimicking the body's natural insulin production.  It is *not* for use in treating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and potentially serious side effect. Symptoms can include shaking, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:**  These can include redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:**  Insulin can cause weight gain in some individuals.
* **Lipohypertrophy:**  This is a buildup of fat at the injection site, which can affect insulin absorption.
* **Allergic reactions:** While rare, allergic reactions are possible.  These can range from mild skin reactions to severe, life-threatening anaphylaxis.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Edema (swelling):**  Fluid retention can occur.
* **Vision changes:** Blurred vision can be a side effect.
* **Hypokalemia (low potassium):** This is a less common but serious side effect.

**How it Works:**

Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analog. It works by binding to insulin receptors on cells, facilitating glucose uptake from the bloodstream into cells for energy.  Unlike regular insulin, which acts quickly, insulin detemir is designed for a prolonged duration of action, providing relatively stable blood glucose control for up to 24 hours. Its extended action is due to its unique structure, which allows it to bind to albumin in the blood, creating a depot from which it is slowly released. This provides a more gradual and predictable lowering of blood sugar levels.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I mix insulin detemir with other insulins?** A:  Generally, no.  Insulin detemir should not be mixed with other insulins in the same syringe.  It's best administered separately. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist for specific instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider for guidance.

* **Q: How should I store insulin detemir?** A:  Store unopened insulin detemir in the refrigerator.  Once opened, it can be stored at room temperature for up to 28 days or as indicated on the label.  Avoid freezing.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?** A:  Treat low blood sugar immediately by consuming a fast-acting carbohydrate source like glucose tablets, juice, or candy.  Always carry a form of fast-acting sugar with you.  Seek medical attention if hypoglycemia is severe or doesn't improve.

* **Q: Can I switch from another type of insulin to insulin detemir?** A:  No. This should only be done under the close supervision of a healthcare professional, who will adjust the dosage to prevent hypo- or hyperglycemia.
