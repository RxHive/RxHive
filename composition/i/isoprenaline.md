# Isoprenaline

**Generic Name:** Isoprenaline (also known as Isoproterenol)

**Usage:**

Isoprenaline is a bronchodilator primarily used to treat:

* **Severe bronchospasm:**  Specifically in cases of acute asthma attacks or other respiratory conditions causing severe airway narrowing where other treatments have failed. Its use is increasingly less common due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives.
* **Cardiac arrest:** Historically, it was sometimes used in the treatment of cardiac arrest, but this is now rarely done due to the risk of serious side effects.  It may be considered in specific circumstances under expert guidance.
* **Heart block (certain types):**  Again, rarely used now and only in very specific situations under close medical supervision.


**Side Effects:**

Isoprenaline has a significant number of potential side effects, many of which can be serious:

* **Cardiac effects:** Palpitations, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), angina (chest pain), arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), increased risk of heart attack, and even cardiac arrest.
* **Metabolic effects:** Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), hypokalemia (low potassium levels).
* **Nervous system effects:** Tremors, headache, nervousness, anxiety.
* **Respiratory effects:** Cough, paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of airway narrowing).
* **Gastrointestinal effects:** Nausea, vomiting.


**How it Works:**

Isoprenaline is a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist.  This means it stimulates both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the body.

* **Beta-1 receptors:** Primarily located in the heart. Stimulation increases heart rate and force of contraction.
* **Beta-2 receptors:** Primarily located in the lungs and bronchi. Stimulation causes relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscles, leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways).

This dual action explains both its bronchodilating and cardiac stimulating effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Is isoprenaline still widely used?** No.  Due to its significant side effect profile and the availability of safer and more effective alternatives (such as selective beta-2 agonists like salbutamol/albuterol), isoprenaline's use is greatly restricted and largely reserved for emergency situations under strict medical supervision.
* **Is isoprenaline safe for long-term use?** No.  Long-term use is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of serious side effects, especially cardiac complications.
* **What are the alternatives to isoprenaline?**  Several safer and more effective bronchodilators are available, including selective beta-2 agonists (salbutamol/albuterol, terbutaline), anticholinergics (ipratropium bromide), and methylxanthines (theophylline).
* **Can I take isoprenaline without a prescription?**  No. Isoprenaline is a prescription-only medication.  It should only be administered under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.
