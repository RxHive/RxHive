# Ivosidenib
### Generic Name
Ivosidenib

### Usage

Ivosidenib is a targeted therapy used to treat specific types of cancers driven by a mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene.  Its primary use is in adult patients with:

* **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML):** This is a type of blood cancer. Ivosidenib is used in two scenarios:
    * **Newly diagnosed AML:**  In patients aged 75 or older, or those with health problems preventing them from undergoing intensive chemotherapy, ivosidenib is used either alone or in combination with azacitidine.
    * **Relapsed or refractory AML:**  This refers to AML that has returned after treatment or that hasn't responded to previous treatments. Ivosidenib is used as a monotherapy (alone) in these cases.  In both instances, the presence of an IDH1 mutation must be confirmed by an FDA-approved test.
* **Locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma:** This is a cancer of the bile ducts, and treatment with ivosidenib requires prior treatment and confirmation of an IDH1 mutation via an FDA-approved test.

The effectiveness of ivosidenib depends on the presence of a specific IDH1 mutation; therefore, genetic testing is crucial before starting treatment.


### Dosage

The standard adult dose of ivosidenib is 500 mg once daily (OD) by mouth. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  For newly diagnosed AML, a minimum of six months of treatment is recommended to allow for a clinical response, whether given as monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m² subcutaneously or intravenously once daily on days 1-7 or days 1-5 and 8-9 of each 28-day cycle).  The same six-month minimum applies to relapsed or refractory AML. There is no established pediatric dosage.


Dosage adjustments are needed in certain situations:


* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh A or B), no dose adjustment is necessary.  For severe impairment (Child-Pugh C), careful consideration of risks versus benefits is needed; no specific dosage adjustment is provided.
* **Renal Impairment:** For an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m², no adjustment is necessary. For eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m² or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, careful consideration of risks versus benefits is required; no specific dosage adjustments are provided.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose adjustments or interruptions may be necessary based on specific toxicities.  These include differentiation syndrome (requiring corticosteroids and potential interruption of ivosidenib), Guillain-Barré syndrome (requiring permanent discontinuation), leukocytosis (requiring cytoreduction therapy), and QTc prolongation (requiring dose reduction or discontinuation). Consult prescribing information for precise management guidelines.
* **Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** When co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the ivosidenib dose should be reduced to 250 mg OD.  The dose can be increased back to 500 mg OD after the inhibitor is discontinued, allowing sufficient time for elimination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* **AML:**  Nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, dizziness, headache, constipation, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath,  differentiation syndrome (a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention), and low blood cell counts.
* **Cholangiocarcinoma:** Nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, headache, peripheral neuropathy, rash, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.


Less common but serious side effects include QTc interval prolongation (a risk of abnormal heart rhythm), Guillain-Barré syndrome (a neurological disorder), and tumor lysis syndrome (a rapid release of substances from dying cancer cells).  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Ivosidenib is a targeted therapy that works by inhibiting the mutated IDH1 enzyme.  Cancer cells with this specific mutation produce an abnormal amount of a substance called 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which contributes to the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. Ivosidenib blocks the activity of the mutated enzyme, reducing 2-HG levels and promoting the maturation and death of cancer cells.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Ivosidenib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for one month after the last dose.
* **Breastfeeding:** Women should not breastfeed while taking ivosidenib or for one month after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ivosidenib can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the CYP3A4 enzyme or prolong the QTc interval.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting treatment.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Careful consideration is required in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* **QTc Prolongation:** Monitor for QTc prolongation;  dose reduction or discontinuation may be necessary.
* **Differentiation Syndrome:** Be vigilant for signs and symptoms and start immediate treatment with corticosteroids if suspected.
* **Genetic Testing:**  Confirm IDH1 mutation status before starting ivosidenib treatment.


### FAQs

* **Can I take ivosidenib with food?** Ivosidenib can be taken with or without food, but avoid taking it with a high-fat meal.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but not within 12 hours of the next scheduled dose. Do not double the dose.

* **How should I store ivosidenib?** Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Can ivosidenib cause heart problems?** Yes, there's a risk of QTc prolongation. Regular monitoring is important.

* **What are the long-term effects of ivosidenib?** Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring helps to detect any potential issues.

* **Should I tell my doctor about all the other medications I'm taking?**  Yes, always inform your healthcare provider of all your medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, to avoid potential interactions.
