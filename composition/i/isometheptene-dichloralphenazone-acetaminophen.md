# Isometheptene + Dichloralphenazone + Acetaminophen
### Generic Name
Isometheptene + Dichloralphenazone + Acetaminophen

### Usage
This combination medication was used to treat migraine headaches and severe tension headaches.  It's important to note that as of January 1, 2018, all manufacturers of isometheptene-containing drugs ceased distribution, making this combination largely unavailable.  Therefore, the information below is for historical and informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for current use.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for current treatment options for headaches.

### Dosage
**Important:**  This medication is no longer available. The dosage information below is provided for historical context only.

**Migraine Headache (Oral):** The recommended dosage was typically 2 capsules (containing Isometheptene 65 mg/Dichloralphenazone 100 mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg) at the onset of the headache, followed by 1 capsule every hour until pain relief was achieved. The maximum recommended dose was 5 capsules within a 12-hour period.

**Tension Headache (Oral):**  The usual dosage was 1-2 capsules (Isometheptene 65 mg/Dichloralphenazone 100 mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg) every 4 hours, with a maximum of 8 capsules in a 24-hour period.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Safety and efficacy in children were not established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling did not provide dosage adjustments for mild or moderate renal impairment.  Use was contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment or hepatic disease.

### Side Effects
* Rash
* Transient dizziness

More serious, though less common, side effects are possible.  Any concerning side effects warrant immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
This combination drug worked through a multifaceted approach:

* **Isometheptene:**  A sympathomimetic agent, it caused constriction of dilated cerebral (brain) and cranial arterioles (small blood vessels), helping to reduce headache pain.

* **Dichloralphenazone:** This component possessed a mild sedative effect, potentially reducing the emotional response to pain.

* **Acetaminophen:**  This analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system (CNS), potentially blocking pain impulses and reducing fever by acting on the hypothalamus (part of the brain regulating temperature).


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  This combination was contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to any of the components.
* Glaucoma.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Severe hepatic impairment (liver disease).
* Hypertension (high blood pressure).
* Organic heart disease.
* Peripheral vascular disease.
* Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular insufficiency (recent heart attack or stroke).
* History of taking MAO inhibitors within the preceding 14 days.

**Warnings:** There was an increased risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage), skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis), hypersensitivity reactions, and CNS depression.

**Use with Caution:**  This medication should be used cautiously in patients with G6PD deficiency and those performing tasks requiring alertness (e.g., driving or operating machinery).  Patients should avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.  The product contained Acetaminophen and carries a boxed warning about the risk of severe liver damage if exceeding the maximum daily dose or combining with other Acetaminophen-containing products.
