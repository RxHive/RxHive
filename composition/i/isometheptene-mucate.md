### How it Works
Isometheptene mucate is a sympathomimetic amine. This means it works by activating the sympathetic nervous system.  This activation leads to the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which cause constriction of dilated blood vessels in the head (cranial and cerebral arterioles).  By reducing the dilation of these blood vessels, it was thought to alleviate the pain associated with vascular headaches.
