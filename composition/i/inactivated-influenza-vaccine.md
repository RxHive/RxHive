# Inactivated influenza vaccine

**Generic Name:** Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV)  *(Note: There isn't one single generic name as different manufacturers produce it.  This refers to the class of vaccine)*

**Usage:**  IIV is used to prevent influenza (flu).  It's recommended annually for most people 6 months of age and older. Specific recommendations may vary based on age, health status, and risk factors, as determined by a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**  Most side effects are mild and temporary.  They can include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Fever
* Fatigue
* Nausea


More serious side effects are rare but possible.  These include:

* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially severe) –  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing, hives, or swelling of the face and throat.
* Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) – A rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness. The risk is extremely low.

**How it Works:**  The IIV contains inactivated (killed) influenza viruses.  These viruses are not able to cause the flu.  When injected, the vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the influenza viruses included in the vaccine.  These antibodies then protect against infection if you are later exposed to those specific flu viruses.  The vaccine's effectiveness varies from year to year depending on the match between the viruses in the vaccine and the circulating viruses.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How effective is the flu vaccine?**  A:  The effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies from year to year, depending on the match between the vaccine and circulating strains.  Even when not perfectly matched, it can still offer some protection, reducing the severity of illness.

* **Q: Can I get the flu from the flu vaccine?** A: No. The IIV contains inactivated (killed) viruses and cannot cause influenza.  Some mild flu-like symptoms may occur as a side effect, but these are caused by the body's immune response, not the virus itself.

* **Q: Who should not get the flu vaccine?** A:  People with a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including eggs (in some formulations), should not receive it.  Individuals with certain medical conditions may also need to consult their doctor before receiving the vaccine.

* **Q: When should I get the flu vaccine?** A: The ideal time to get vaccinated is in the fall, before flu season begins.  It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to become fully effective.

* **Q: Does the flu vaccine cause autism?** A: No.  Extensive research has shown no link between the flu vaccine and autism.
