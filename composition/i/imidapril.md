# Imidapril
### Generic Name
Imidapril

### Usage

Imidapril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily, thus lowering blood pressure.  A secondary, but significant, use is in managing diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage) in patients with type 1 diabetes.  This is because Imidapril helps to slow the progression of kidney disease in these patients.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hypertension:** The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily, taken before food.  This dose may be increased to 10 mg daily after at least three weeks, depending on individual response.  The maximum dose is 20 mg daily.  For patients with angina, cerebrovascular disease, or a high risk of low blood pressure upon initial dosing, the starting dose should be 2.5 mg daily under close medical supervision. Older adults usually start with 2.5 mg daily and may increase to a maximum of 10 mg daily if needed.

* **Diabetic nephropathy:**  The typical dose is 5 mg once daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of Imidapril in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function. Patients with hepatic impairment usually begin with a reduced dose of 2.5 mg once daily.  For patients with kidney problems, dosage adjustments depend on the severity of kidney function.  Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance in these situations.  The medication is contraindicated in patients with severely reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min).

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Cough
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**  These require immediate medical attention:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Acute kidney failure
* Changes in blood counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Jaundice

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Imidapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  ACE is an enzyme involved in the body's regulation of blood pressure. Imidapril blocks ACE, preventing the formation of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By reducing angiotensin II levels, Imidapril causes blood vessels to relax and widen, lowering blood pressure.  It also reduces aldosterone secretion, contributing further to blood pressure control.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Imidapril is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors, hereditary or idiopathic angioedema, severe kidney problems, pregnancy, and those undergoing certain types of dialysis.  It should not be used with certain other medications, especially those containing aliskiren in patients with diabetes or kidney issues.

* **Interactions:** Imidapril can interact with many other medications, including other blood pressure medications, diuretics, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and others.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Imidapril is categorized as a Pregnancy Category D medication, meaning it poses a risk to a developing fetus. It should not be used during pregnancy or by women who are breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, heart conditions (such as aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), or those with electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring is necessary in patients at risk for hypotension (e.g., those who are dehydrated).


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Imidapril?** A:  It's advisable to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking Imidapril, as it can increase the risk of low blood pressure.

* **Q: How should I store Imidapril?** A: Store Imidapril at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Imidapril suddenly?** A:  No.  Suddenly stopping Imidapril can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure. Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue the medication.

* **Q:  Are there any dietary restrictions while taking Imidapril?** A: While there aren't strict dietary restrictions, maintaining a balanced diet low in sodium is beneficial in managing hypertension.  High-fat meals can reduce the absorption of Imidapril.

* **Q:  How long does it take for Imidapril to start working?** A:  It can take several weeks to see the full effects of Imidapril.
