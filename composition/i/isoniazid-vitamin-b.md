# Isoniazid + Vitamin B

**Generic Name:** Isoniazid/Pyridoxine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to prevent and treat tuberculosis (TB). Isoniazid is the primary anti-TB drug, while pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is added to prevent or reduce the risk of certain side effects caused by isoniazid, particularly peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage).  It's crucial to note that this combination is preventative and/or used as part of a broader TB treatment regimen, not a standalone cure. The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual factors.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Tingling, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet (vitamin B6 helps mitigate this).
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common, especially at the beginning of treatment.
* **Dizziness:** Some patients experience dizziness.
* **Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes):** This is a rare but serious side effect indicating liver damage.
* **Liver damage (hepatitis):**  A serious potential side effect, often indicated by jaundice, fatigue, or dark urine. Regular liver function tests are essential during treatment.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Skin rash, itching, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak.


**How it Works:**

* **Isoniazid:** This drug interferes with the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the cell wall of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria that cause TB.  By disrupting cell wall formation, isoniazid prevents the bacteria from multiplying and growing.

* **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6):** Isoniazid can interfere with the body's use of pyridoxine. Supplementing with vitamin B6 helps prevent or lessen the severity of peripheral neuropathy, a common side effect of isoniazid.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long do I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment depends on individual circumstances and the type of TB infection (latent or active). Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length, which can range from several months to a year or more.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Immediately contact your doctor if you experience any concerning side effects, especially severe or unusual ones, such as jaundice, severe skin reactions, or significant neurological symptoms.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage, so it's generally advised to avoid alcohol consumption while taking isoniazid/pyridoxine.

* **Q:  Can I take other medications with this combination?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications may interact with isoniazid or pyridoxine.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Are there any food restrictions while taking this medication?** A: There aren't specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet is always recommended.  Consult your doctor if you have any specific dietary concerns.
