# Indinavir

**Generic Name:** Indinavir sulfate

**Usage:**

Indinavir is an antiviral medication used to treat HIV infection. It's typically used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to suppress the virus and improve the immune system's ability to fight off infection. It's not a cure for HIV, but it can significantly slow the progression of the disease and improve quality of life.  It is important to note that Indinavir is less commonly used now than it was in the past due to the development of newer, better-tolerated medications.

**Side Effects:**

Indinavir has a notable profile of side effects, some of which can be quite significant. These can include:

* **Kidney stones:** This is a serious and relatively common side effect.  Increased fluid intake is crucial to help mitigate this risk.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These gastrointestinal side effects can be debilitating for some patients.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can lead to dehydration.
* **Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):** Can exacerbate diabetes or cause new onset diabetes.
* **Fat redistribution:**  This can cause changes in body shape and fat accumulation in unusual places.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  Indicating potential liver damage.  Liver function tests are regularly monitored during Indinavir treatment.
* **Kidney problems:**  Indinavir can impair kidney function.
* **Headache:** A common side effect.
* **Rash:**  Allergic reactions are possible.
* **Insomnia**
* **Fatigue**
* **Dizziness**
* **Peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in extremities)**


This list is not exhaustive, and the severity of side effects varies greatly between individuals.

**How it Works:**

Indinavir is a protease inhibitor.  Proteases are enzymes HIV needs to replicate.  By inhibiting these proteases, Indinavir prevents HIV from producing infectious viral particles, thereby slowing the progression of the infection.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Indinavir still used?** While once a mainstay of HIV treatment, Indinavir's use has significantly decreased due to the emergence of newer protease inhibitors with better tolerability and fewer side effects. It might still be used in certain situations, particularly in resource-limited settings where newer drugs are less accessible or in patients who cannot tolerate other medications.

* **What are the drug interactions?** Indinavir interacts with many other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **How is Indinavir administered?** It's typically taken orally, usually in multiple doses per day. The specific dosage and frequency are determined by a physician based on individual needs.

* **What are the long-term effects?**  Long-term use of Indinavir can increase the risk of kidney stones, kidney damage, liver problems, and metabolic complications like hyperglycemia and fat redistribution. Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function is essential.

* **Can Indinavir be used during pregnancy?**  The use of Indinavir during pregnancy should be carefully considered and managed by a healthcare professional due to potential risks to the developing fetus.
