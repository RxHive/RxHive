# Indinavir
### Generic Name
Indinavir

### Usage
Indinavir is an antiretroviral medication, specifically a protease inhibitor.  Its primary use is in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It's crucial to understand that indinavir is *not* a cure for HIV, but rather a part of a combination therapy known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  HAART aims to suppress the virus, slowing its progression and improving the patient's quality of life. Indinavir works by blocking the HIV protease enzyme, which is essential for the virus to replicate.  Without this enzyme, the virus cannot produce infectious copies of itself.  While primarily used for HIV-1, there might be off-label uses explored by healthcare professionals in specific circumstances, but these should always be under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, overall health, and whether it's used in a boosted or unboosted regimen.  It's vital to follow a physician's precise instructions.

**Adults (HIV-1 infection):**

* **Unboosted:**  The typical dose is 800 mg orally every 8 hours.
* **Ritonavir-boosted (off-label):**  A common boosted regimen involves 800 mg of indinavir twice daily (BID) along with 100-200 mg of ritonavir BID.  The specific ritonavir dose will be determined by the prescribing physician.  If a dose is missed by less than two hours, it can be taken immediately; otherwise, the missed dose should be skipped, and the regular schedule resumed.

**Children (HIV-1 infection):**

Dosage for children is determined by their weight and age and should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional. Adolescents may receive the adult dosage of 800 mg every 8 hours (unboosted) or a ritonavir-boosted regimen similar to adults.  Always adhere to the pediatrician's exact instructions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney impairment.  However, specific guidelines for these adjustments may not be explicitly available for all levels of impairment and should always be determined by the physician.

**Administration:**

Indinavir capsules are usually taken orally.  Specific instructions regarding food intake will be provided by the physician;  some regimens might necessitate taking the medication with or without food, while others may require it to be taken on an empty stomach.  Drinking sufficient water is essential, usually around 48 ounces daily, to help prevent kidney stones.

### Side Effects
Indinavir, like other medications, can cause side effects. These can vary in severity and frequency.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Skin rash
* Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver problems (hepatitis, jaundice)
* Pancreatitis
* Hemolytic anemia
*  Metabolic changes (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia)
*  Fat redistribution

If any concerning side effect develops, it is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Indinavir is a protease inhibitor.  HIV needs protease to produce new copies of itself.  Indinavir works by binding to the HIV protease enzyme, preventing it from functioning correctly.  This blockage stops the virus from making new infectious viral particles, thus controlling the viral load in the body.

### Precautions
Several precautions are vital when using indinavir:

* **Allergies:** Indinavir should not be used by individuals with known allergies to it or its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Indinavir interacts with many other drugs.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions can significantly affect the effectiveness of indinavir and increase the risk of side effects.  For instance, co-administration with certain medications can lead to increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, myopathy, or increased sedation and respiratory depression.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:** Indinavir can affect liver and kidney function; therefore, regular monitoring of these functions is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Indinavir is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The potential risks and benefits should be carefully weighed by a healthcare professional.  Indinavir is excreted in breast milk, posing potential risks to the infant.
* **Diabetes:** Indinavir can cause hyperglycemia, so patients with diabetes should be closely monitored.
* **Hemophilia:**  There's an increased risk of bleeding in individuals with hemophilia A or B.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Indinavir with food?** A:  Whether or not Indinavir should be taken with food depends on the specific regimen prescribed by your doctor. Some regimens require it to be taken on an empty stomach, while boosted regimens may allow it to be taken with food.

* **Q: How should I store Indinavir?** A: Store Indinavir at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions regarding missed doses. Generally, if the missed dose is within a certain timeframe (usually less than 2 hours), you can take it immediately; otherwise, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular schedule.

* **Q:  Is Indinavir a cure for HIV?** A: No, Indinavir is not a cure for HIV. It's part of a combination therapy that helps to manage the infection and improve the patient's quality of life.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of taking Indinavir?** A:  Long-term effects can vary, but regular monitoring of liver and kidney function, blood glucose, lipid levels, and other parameters is necessary to detect potential problems early.
