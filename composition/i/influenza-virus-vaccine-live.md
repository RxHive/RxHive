# Influenza Virus Vaccine, Live
### Generic Name
Influenza Virus Vaccine, Live

### Usage
Influenza virus vaccine, live, is a nasal spray vaccine used for the active immunization of individuals aged 2 to 49 years against influenza (flu) caused by influenza A and B viruses.  It's designed to prevent illness caused by these viruses, reducing the severity of symptoms and the risk of complications.  This vaccine is specifically formulated for use as a nasal spray; it is not an injectable vaccine.

### Dosage
**Adults (2-49 years old):** A single 0.2 mL dose (0.1 mL in each nostril) per season is recommended.

**Children (2 years and older):** The dosage depends on previous vaccination history.

*   **One dose:**  If the child has received two or more doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1st of the current flu season.
*   **Two doses:** If the child has received one or fewer doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine before July 1st of the current flu season, or if their vaccination status is unknown.  The two doses should be administered at least 4 weeks apart.  A child turning 9 years old between doses should still receive both.


**Administration:** The vaccine is administered intranasally (into the nostrils).  The nasal spray is carefully administered, with 0.1 mL placed in each nostril.  Patients should be upright during administration and should not need to inhale forcefully.  If sneezing or coughing occurs after administration, the dose does not need to be repeated.

### How it Works
The live attenuated influenza virus vaccine works by introducing a weakened form of the influenza virus into the body.  This triggers an immune response, causing the body to produce antibodies against the virus.  These antibodies provide protection against future infections with similar influenza viruses.  The nasal spray delivery allows for a localized immune response in the respiratory tract, offering protection where the virus typically enters the body.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

*   Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any vaccine component, including egg protein, or a previous influenza vaccination.
*   Children aged 2–4 years with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months.
*   Immunocompromising conditions (including immunosuppressive therapy, HIV, and asplenia).
*   Children and adolescents (2–17 years) receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy due to the association of Reye syndrome with aspirin and wild-type influenza infection.
*   Close contacts of severely immunosuppressed individuals requiring a protected environment.
*   Pregnancy.
*   Persons with active cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage.
*   Persons with cochlear implants.
*   Recent use of oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, or baloxavir (within specified timeframes before vaccination).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

*   Use with caution in patients with asthma (aged ≥5 years), underlying medical conditions increasing influenza complication risk (chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders), or a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
*   Immunosuppressants, antineoplastics, or high-dose corticosteroids may reduce vaccine effectiveness; avoid concurrent use.
*   Aldesleukin and aspirin may increase antibody response; avoid concurrent use.
*   The vaccine may increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin; avoid concurrent use.
