# Isopropyl Alcohol
### Generic Name
Isopropyl Alcohol

### Usage
Isopropyl alcohol, commonly known as rubbing alcohol, is primarily used as an antiseptic for the prevention of topical infections.  This means it helps to kill germs on the surface of the skin, reducing the risk of infection in minor wounds like cuts, scrapes, and burns. It's also used to clean the skin before injections or minor surgical procedures.  Beyond its antiseptic properties, isopropyl alcohol is sometimes used as a rubbing agent to provide a cooling sensation and stimulate blood flow to the skin.  Note that its use as a hand sanitizer is also common, although other options are often preferred.


### Dosage
Dosage for isopropyl alcohol depends largely on the intended use, as it's applied topically rather than taken internally.  For antiseptic use in treating minor wounds or preparing skin for injections, the amount needed varies depending on the size of the affected area.  A small amount is sufficient to cover the wound or injection site.  There are no specific dosage guidelines in terms of volume for adults or children. For hand sanitization, consult product-specific instructions as concentrations vary.


### Side Effects
* Burning sensation
* Stinging
* Cold feeling at the application site

These are generally mild and temporary.  Serious side effects are rare with topical application, but ingestion of isopropyl alcohol is dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Isopropyl alcohol works by denaturing proteins and disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and other microorganisms. This effectively kills them and reduces the risk of infection in minor wounds.  Its ability to dissolve lipids (fats) in cell membranes also contributes to its effectiveness as an antiseptic.

### Precautions
* **External use only:** Isopropyl alcohol is for external application only. Ingestion can be fatal.
* **Flammable:** Keep away from open flames and sources of ignition.
* **Avoid contact with eyes:**  If accidental eye contact occurs, flush immediately with plenty of water and seek medical attention.
* **Avoid large areas of application:**  While isopropyl alcohol is generally safe for topical use on minor wounds, applying it to large areas of the skin can lead to absorption and potential systemic effects.  
* **Pregnancy and lactation:** While studies on its effects on pregnancy and breastfeeding are limited, caution is advised.  Consult your doctor before using isopropyl alcohol if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** Use with caution in children and always supervise their use.  Avoid contact with eyes and mouth.
* **Drug interactions:** No significant drug interactions are known when used topically as directed. However, combining it with other topical medications should be done only under medical supervision to avoid potential complications.


### FAQs
