# Isopropyl Alcohol

**Generic Name:** Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)

**Usage:**

* **Disinfectant:**  Isopropyl alcohol is widely used as a disinfectant to kill bacteria and viruses on surfaces and skin.  It's effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, though not all.  Concentrations of 60-90% are generally most effective.  Higher concentrations are less effective because the water component aids in penetration and disruption of microbial cell walls.
* **Solvent:** IPA is a common solvent used in various industrial and household applications, including cleaning electronics, dissolving resins, and removing adhesives.
* **Medical Use:**  Used topically for cleansing the skin before injections or other medical procedures (although newer guidelines are moving away from routine use due to potential skin irritation).
* **Other Uses:** As a component in some cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and fuel additives.

**Side Effects:**

* **Skin Irritation:**  Prolonged or frequent exposure can cause skin dryness, irritation, redness, and cracking.
* **Eye Irritation:**  Contact with eyes can cause burning, stinging, and redness.
* **Inhalation:**  Inhaling significant amounts of IPA vapors can cause respiratory irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea.  Severe cases can lead to central nervous system depression.
* **Ingestion:**  Ingestion of isopropyl alcohol is toxic and can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, central nervous system depression, coma, and even death.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions (skin rashes, itching) are possible in sensitive individuals.

**How it Works:**

Isopropyl alcohol works as a disinfectant by denaturing proteins and disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and viruses, leading to their inactivation and death.  The mechanism involves disrupting lipid bilayers (the outer layers of cells) and altering protein structures, preventing them from functioning properly.

**FAQs:**

* **Is isopropyl alcohol the same as rubbing alcohol?**  In many cases, yes.  Rubbing alcohol is commonly isopropyl alcohol diluted with water.
* **What concentration of isopropyl alcohol is best for disinfection?**  Generally, a 60-90% solution is most effective.  Higher concentrations are less effective because water is needed for proper penetration.
* **Is isopropyl alcohol flammable?** Yes, it is highly flammable. Keep away from open flames and sparks.
* **Can I use isopropyl alcohol on all surfaces?** No, it can damage some materials, including plastics, certain finishes, and electronics. Always test on an inconspicuous area first.
* **What should I do if I accidentally ingest isopropyl alcohol?** Immediately contact poison control or seek medical attention.
* **Can I use isopropyl alcohol to sterilize medical equipment?**  While it can kill many microorganisms, it may not be sufficient for sterilization, which requires complete elimination of all microorganisms, including spores.  A higher level disinfectant or sterilization method would be necessary for medical equipment.
* **What should I do if isopropyl alcohol gets in my eyes?** Immediately flush your eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention.
