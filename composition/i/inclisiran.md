# Inclisiran
### Generic Name
Inclisiran

### Usage
Inclisiran is a medication used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often referred to as "bad" cholesterol.  It's specifically indicated as an add-on therapy to diet and maximally tolerated statin treatment for adults with either heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).  These are individuals who need an additional reduction in LDL-C levels beyond what statins alone can achieve.  It's important to note that the impact of Inclisiran on cardiovascular events (like heart attacks or strokes) hasn't yet been definitively established.

### Dosage
Inclisiran is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as a single 284 mg injection. The initial injection is followed by another injection at 3 months, and then subsequent injections every 6 months.  It is always used in conjunction with the maximum tolerated dose of statin medication.  The dosage is the same for adults regardless of age, weight, or disease severity within the approved indications.  There is no established dosage for children; its use in pediatric patients is not yet approved.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are generally not needed for mild to moderate cases; however, use in individuals with severe hepatic or end-stage renal disease hasn't been studied.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

*   Diarrhea
*   Bronchitis
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*   Arthralgia (joint pain)
*   Pain in extremities
*   Urinary tract infection
*   Injection site reactions

While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  Any concerning or persistent side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Inclisiran is a type of medication called a small interfering RNA (siRNA). It works by targeting a specific protein in the liver called PCSK9. PCSK9 normally inhibits the body's ability to remove LDL-C from the bloodstream. By silencing the PCSK9 gene, Inclisiran increases the liver's capacity to clear LDL-C, ultimately leading to lower levels of LDL-C in the blood.

### Precautions
*   **Pregnancy:** Inclisiran may harm a developing fetus.  It should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs, and women of childbearing age should be advised of this risk.
*   **Breastfeeding:** The presence of Inclisiran in breast milk, its effects on the infant, and its impact on milk production are unknown.  The benefits and risks of breastfeeding should be carefully considered in consultation with a healthcare provider.
*   **Injection Site Reactions:** Injection site reactions are a known risk, and proper injection technique is important.
*   **Other Medications:**  While specific drug interactions aren't extensively detailed, it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, to avoid potential interactions.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A: LDL-C lowering effects can be seen as early as 30 days after the initial dose.
*   **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose by less than 3 months, administer Inclisiran and continue with your original schedule. If the missed dose is more than 3 months late, restart the treatment with a new schedule (initial dose, then at 3 months, and then every 6 months).
*   **Q: How should Inclisiran be stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.
*   **Q: Is Inclisiran a cure for high cholesterol?** A: No, Inclisiran is a treatment to help manage high cholesterol. It's essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including diet and exercise, in conjunction with medication.
*   **Q:  Can I take Inclisiran with other cholesterol-lowering medications?** A:  Inclisiran is typically used in combination with statins. Always discuss your medication regimen with your doctor.
