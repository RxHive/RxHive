# Itraconazole

**Generic Name:** Itraconazole

**Usage:** Itraconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat a variety of fungal infections, including:

* **Systemic fungal infections:**  These are infections that spread throughout the body, such as histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis.
* **Specific fungal infections:**  Such as onychomycosis (fungal nail infections), candidiasis (yeast infections) affecting the mouth, throat, esophagus, or vagina, and dermatophytoses (ringworm, athlete's foot, jock itch).


**Side Effects:**  Itraconazole can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent or severe.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting.
* **Less common but potentially serious side effects:** Liver problems (hepatotoxicity –  monitor liver function tests regularly), heart problems (especially QT prolongation –  a risk factor for dangerous heart rhythms), hearing loss, visual disturbances, skin rash, allergic reactions.


**How it Works:** Itraconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol production, itraconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and inhibiting fungal growth.
