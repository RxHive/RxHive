# Idursulfase
### Generic Name
Idursulfase

### Usage
Idursulfase is a prescription enzyme replacement therapy specifically indicated for treating Hunter syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II).  Hunter syndrome is a rare, inherited genetic disorder that prevents the body from properly breaking down certain complex sugars (glycosaminoglycans or GAGs).  This buildup of GAGs leads to progressive damage in multiple organs, impacting physical development, cognitive function, and various bodily systems. Idursulfase works by replacing the missing or deficient enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase, which is crucial for the breakdown of these harmful sugars.  Treatment aims to slow disease progression and improve symptoms.


### Dosage
Idursulfase is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage is individualized based on the patient's weight.

**Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter Syndrome):**

* **Adults and children aged 5 years and older:** The usual dose is 0.5 mg/kg administered once weekly.  The infusion should be given over 1-3 hours;  however, if hypersensitivity reactions occur, the infusion time may need to be extended, but should not exceed 8 hours.
* **Children aged 16 months to less than 5 years:** The usual dose is 0.5 mg/kg once weekly.  Infusion time recommendations are the same as above.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage adjustments based on individual patient factors.


### Side Effects
The following side effects have been reported with idursulfase.  The frequency of some effects is not precisely defined.  Serious reactions are rare but require immediate medical attention.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Flushing
* Skin rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria)
* Vomiting
* Development of antibodies against the drug
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Pyrexia (fever)
* In children:  Otitis (ear infection), pneumonia

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Chills
* Dizziness
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Cough
* Erythema (redness of the skin)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Loss of consciousness
* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
* Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin)
* Cardiorespiratory arrest (sudden cessation of breathing and heartbeat)
* Respiratory failure
* Respiratory distress
* Cardiac failure


**Important Note:**  This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any adverse effect, particularly severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Idursulfase is a recombinant (laboratory-made) form of the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase. In individuals with Hunter syndrome, this enzyme is either missing or doesn't function properly.  As a result, harmful glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) – dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate – accumulate in the body's cells and tissues. Idursulfase works by replacing this missing enzyme.  By supplying the body with the functional enzyme, it helps break down the accumulated GAGs, thus slowing the progression of the disease and potentially improving symptoms.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Idursulfase is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.  Serious and even fatal allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported. Close monitoring is essential during and after each infusion.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Patients should be carefully monitored for infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity during and after treatment. Medical support should be readily available.
* **Respiratory Illness:**  Use caution in patients with acute respiratory infections or compromised respiratory function, as hypersensitivity reactions can worsen respiratory symptoms.
* **Fluid Overload:** Use caution in patients at risk of fluid overload or those requiring fluid restriction.
* **Severe Genetic Mutations:** Idursulfase may be less effective in patients with severe genetic mutations.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Idursulfase is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor to weigh the risks and benefits.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known. However, always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need treatment with idursulfase?** A: Treatment with idursulfase is typically long-term, often lifelong.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to determine the best course of action.  Do not double the next dose.

* **Q: How is idursulfase stored?** A:  Storage instructions should be followed as per the manufacturer's guidelines.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of idursulfase?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known, and ongoing monitoring is important.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery after receiving idursulfase?** A:  This depends on how you react to the medication.  If you experience side effects like dizziness or drowsiness, avoid driving or operating machinery until the effects subside.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a hypersensitivity reaction?** A:  Stop the infusion immediately and seek immediate medical attention. This is a medical emergency.
