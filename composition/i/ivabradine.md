# Ivabradine
### Generic Name
Ivabradine

### Usage
Ivabradine's primary use is to reduce the risk of hospitalization due to worsening heart failure in adults.  This is specifically for those with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less, sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of 70 bpm or more, and who are either on the maximum tolerated dose of beta-blockers or have contraindications to their use.  Ivabradine is also used to treat stable symptomatic heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy in children aged 6 months and older.  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used off-label for stable angina and inappropriate sinus tachycardia.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Heart Failure:** The initial oral dose is typically 5 mg twice daily (BID), or 2.5 mg BID for patients with a history of conduction defects or those at risk of hemodynamic compromise from bradycardia.  The dose is adjusted over two weeks to achieve a resting heart rate of 50-60 bpm.  Maximum dose is 7.5 mg BID. Dosage adjustments are made based on the resting heart rate; if above 60 bpm, increase; if below 50 bpm or bradycardia symptoms appear, decrease or discontinue.

* **Stable Angina (off-label):** For adults under 75, the initial oral dose is 2.5-5 mg BID.  The dose may be increased in increments of 2.5 mg after 3-4 weeks if symptoms persist and the heart rate is above 60 bpm, up to a maximum of 7.5 mg BID. Treatment should be discontinued if angina doesn't improve within three months or if there's limited improvement and no significant heart rate reduction.  Reduce or stop the medication if the resting heart rate falls below 50 bpm or if bradycardia symptoms occur.


* **Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (off-label):** The initial oral dose is 5 mg BID, with a maintenance dose of 7.5 mg BID.  Combination with a beta-blocker might be considered for those who don't respond to monotherapy.

**Children (Heart Failure, Dilated Cardiomyopathy):**

Dosage depends on weight and age (6 months and older).  For children weighing less than 40 kg, the starting oral dose is 0.05 mg/kg/dose BID, increased every two weeks by 0.05 mg/kg/dose as tolerated to achieve a 20% heart rate reduction without causing bradycardia.  Maximum doses vary with age (see product information for details).  For children weighing 40 kg or more, dosage starts at 2.5 mg BID and is adjusted similarly.  Adolescents 18 years and older follow the adult heart failure dosing guidelines.

**Dosage Adjustments:** For mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary.  Ivabradine is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.  For renal impairment, no adjustment is needed if creatinine clearance (CrCl) is 15 mL/min or more;  manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide guidance for CrCl below 15 mL/min.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Phosphene (seeing flashes of light)
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure), atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)

**Less Common but Serious:**

* Cardiovascular: Heart block, sinoatrial arrest

**Rare (less than 1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Angioedema (swelling), diplopia (double vision), erythema (redness), hypotension (low blood pressure), pruritus (itching), skin rash, syncope (fainting), torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat), urticaria (hives), ventricular fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), ventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), vertigo (dizziness), visual impairment.

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Ivabradine selectively and specifically blocks hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (also known as "funny" channels or If channels) in the sinoatrial (SA) node of the heart. This action disrupts the inward If current, prolonging the diastolic depolarization phase and slowing the rate of firing in the SA node, resulting in a decrease in heart rate.  It effectively reduces the heart's workload.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Ivabradine is contraindicated in hypersensitivity to the drug, acute decompensated heart failure, resting heart rate below 70 bpm before treatment, cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction, sick sinus syndrome or sinoatrial block, third-degree atrioventricular block (unless a pacemaker is present), pacemaker dependence, concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (like verapamil or diltiazem), prolonged QT interval, pregnancy, breastfeeding, women of childbearing potential not using contraception, hereditary galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or Lapp lactase deficiency, clinically significant hypotension/bradycardia, and severe hepatic impairment.

**Interactions:** Ivabradine can interact with many drugs, including calcium channel blockers (nondihydropyridine), CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, and other drugs affecting heart rate or rhythm.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions.

**Warnings:**  Ivabradine may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation, fetal toxicity, and phosphene. Closely monitor heart rate and rhythm, especially when starting or adjusting the dose, or if the patient is on other medications affecting heart rate.  Avoid grapefruit juice.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ivabradine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you're taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Ivabradine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Don't take a double dose. Just take the next dose at the usual time.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe bradycardia (very slow heart rate), chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, or any allergic reaction.

* **Q: Can I take Ivabradine if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Ivabradine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Effective contraception is recommended for women of reproductive age.
