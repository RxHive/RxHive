# Iloprost
### Generic Name
Iloprost

### Usage

Iloprost is primarily used to improve exercise tolerance, reduce symptoms, and prevent disease worsening in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), specifically WHO Group 1 PAH.  It achieves this by widening blood vessels in the lungs, reducing pressure within the pulmonary arteries.

Beyond PAH, Iloprost also treats severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD), severe disabling Raynaud's phenomenon, and advanced thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) with critical limb ischemia.  In these conditions, Iloprost improves blood flow to the extremities, relieving symptoms like pain, numbness, and coldness.  It's important to note that its use in these conditions often involves intravenous (IV) administration, unlike its inhalation use in PAH.  There is also off-label use for acute vasodilator testing in patients with PAH who are potential candidates for calcium channel blocker therapy.

### Dosage

Iloprost dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration (inhalation or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The information below is for general knowledge and should not be substituted for professional medical advice.

**Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH):**

* **Inhalation:**  The typical starting dose is 2.5 mcg per dose, potentially increasing to 5 mcg per dose if tolerated.  Administration is typically 6-9 times daily at intervals of at least 2 hours while awake. The maximum daily dose is 45 mcg.
* **Intravenous (IV):** The starting dose is usually 0.5 ng/kg/min, titrated upwards in increments of 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes until the optimal dose (typically 1-8 ng/kg/min) is reached or dose-limiting side effects appear.  Infusion is usually for 6 hours daily, up to 4 weeks.  The concentration of the IV solution (0.2 mcg/mL or 2 mcg/mL) will influence the method of infusion.

**Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD), Raynaud's Phenomenon, Thromboangiitis Obliterans:**

* **Intravenous (IV):**  Similar to PAH IV administration, the starting dose is 0.5 ng/kg/min, titrated upwards in increments of 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 2 ng/kg/min or until side effects limit further increases. The usual maintenance dose is 0.5-2 ng/kg/min.  Infusion is typically for 6 hours daily, up to 4 weeks. Shorter durations (3-5 days) might suffice for Raynaud's phenomenon.  The concentration of the IV solution will again influence the method of infusion.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of Iloprost have not been established in children. Off-label use in children with PAH typically involves lower starting inhaled doses.  Always consult a pediatrician specializing in pediatric cardiology for guidance on appropriate pediatric dosing.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Consult your doctor for guidance on appropriate modifications.

### How it Works

Iloprost is a synthetic prostacyclin analog.  Prostacyclin is a natural substance that helps relax and widen blood vessels. Iloprost mimics this action, dilating both systemic and pulmonary arteries.  This reduces vascular resistance, meaning blood can flow more easily.  With long-term use, Iloprost also helps prevent the abnormal growth of cells in the blood vessel walls, a key process in conditions like PAH.  In addition, when inhaled, it has a mild platelet-aggregation inhibiting effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Intravenous Iloprost is contraindicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding, patients at high risk of bleeding, severe coronary heart disease, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, severe heart failure, severe arrhythmias, suspected pulmonary congestion, recent cerebrovascular events, pulmonary hypertension due to venous occlusive disease, and congenital/acquired valvular defects with myocardial dysfunction (unrelated to pulmonary hypertension). Inhalation Iloprost has no reported contraindications in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Interactions:** Iloprost can enhance the blood pressure-lowering effects of other vasodilators and antihypertensive medications. It may also increase the risk of bleeding when taken with anticoagulants, aspirin, or other antiplatelet agents.  Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:** Use caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those prone to syncope.  Intravenous formulations are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Iloprost to work?** A: The onset of effect varies depending on the route of administration and the condition being treated.  Effects may be noticeable within minutes with IV administration, but full therapeutic benefits might take longer to develop.

* **Q: How should I store Iloprost?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the formulation.  Always refer to the packaging for specific instructions.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Iloprost suddenly?** A: No. Abrupt cessation, especially of IV Iloprost, can lead to a rebound increase in pulmonary hypertension.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose.

* **Q: Is Iloprost safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use is common for PAH treatment.  However, regular monitoring by your doctor is essential to assess effectiveness and monitor for side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose of inhaled Iloprost, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.  For IV Iloprost, contact your doctor immediately for guidance.
