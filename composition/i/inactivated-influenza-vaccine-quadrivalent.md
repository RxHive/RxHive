# Inactivated influenza vaccine Quadrivalent

**Generic Name:** Inactivated Influenza Virus Vaccine, Quadrivalent

**Usage:**  Prevention of influenza (flu) caused by four influenza viruses: two influenza A viruses (one H1N1 and one H3N2 subtype) and two influenza B viruses.  It's recommended annually for individuals 6 months of age and older. Specific recommendations may vary based on age, health status, and risk factors (e.g., pregnant women, individuals with chronic conditions). Consult your doctor for personalized advice.


**Side Effects:**  Most side effects are mild and temporary.  These can include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Fever
* Fatigue
* Chills
* Nausea
* Vomiting (more common in children)
* Allergic reactions (rare but serious, including anaphylaxis; seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing, hives, or swelling).

Serious side effects are rare.  Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), a rare neurological disorder, has been reported following influenza vaccination, but the risk is extremely low.


**How it Works:** The vaccine contains inactivated (killed) influenza viruses.  These viruses are unable to cause the flu, but they stimulate the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the four included strains.  These antibodies provide protection against infection with those specific strains.  Note that the vaccine strains are selected annually based on predictions of circulating strains.  Therefore, there is a chance of mismatch between the vaccine strains and circulating strains, resulting in reduced effectiveness.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is the quadrivalent vaccine better than the trivalent vaccine?** A:  The quadrivalent vaccine offers broader protection by including two influenza B virus strains, compared to the trivalent vaccine, which typically includes only one. This may offer slightly better protection against influenza B viruses, but both vaccines provide important protection.

* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A:  Protection typically lasts for the flu season (approximately 6 months).  Annual vaccination is recommended because influenza viruses constantly change.

* **Q: Can I get the flu from the vaccine?** A:  No. The vaccine contains inactivated (killed) viruses and cannot cause the flu. Some people may experience mild flu-like symptoms after vaccination, which are due to the immune response, not the virus itself.

* **Q: What if I'm allergic to eggs?** A:  Some influenza vaccines are produced using eggs. Discuss your egg allergy with your doctor to determine if this vaccine is suitable for you.  There are egg-free options available in some cases, though these may not always be quadrivalent.

* **Q: When should I get the vaccine?** A:  Ideally, get vaccinated in the fall (September to October) before the flu season begins. However, vaccination is beneficial anytime during flu season.

* **Q:  How effective is the flu vaccine?** A:  Effectiveness varies from year to year depending on the match between vaccine strains and circulating strains, as well as individual factors.  Even if the vaccine doesn't completely prevent the flu, it can lessen the severity of illness.
