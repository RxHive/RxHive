# Inactivated influenza vaccine Quadrivalent
### Generic Name
Inactivated Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent

### Usage
The inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent formulation, is used to prevent influenza (flu).  It protects against four strains of the influenza virus: two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B strains.  The specific strains included in the vaccine are updated annually based on predictions of which strains will be most prevalent during the upcoming flu season. This is a preventative measure; it does not treat the flu once you have contracted it.

### Dosage
The dosage is typically a single intramuscular injection.  The specific volume administered will vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  For adults and children over 6 months of age, a single dose is given annually, usually in the fall.  Infants and children under 6 months of age cannot receive this vaccine.  For individuals aged 65 and older, or those with compromised immune systems, the effectiveness might be slightly reduced, and consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial to determine the suitability and potential need for additional doses or a different approach.  There is no oral or intravenous form of this vaccine; it is only administered via intramuscular injection.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and temporary. They may include:

*   Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
*   Headache
*   Muscle aches
*   Fever
*   Fatigue
*   Nausea


Less common, but more serious side effects are rare but possible and include allergic reactions (ranging from mild hives to serious anaphylaxis). Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction.

### How it Works
The inactivated influenza vaccine contains killed (inactivated) influenza viruses.  When injected, these viruses trigger an immune response in the body.  The immune system recognizes the viral proteins as foreign and produces antibodies against them.  These antibodies provide protection against future infection by the influenza viruses included in the vaccine. The vaccine does not contain live virus, making it safe for most individuals.

### Precautions
*   **Allergies:**  Individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including eggs (as some vaccines are produced using egg-based cell cultures), should not receive this vaccine.  Those with a history of milder allergic reactions should consult their doctor before vaccination.
*   **Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS):**  While a very rare association has been reported, individuals with a history of GBS should discuss the risks and benefits with their physician before getting the vaccine.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The vaccine is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  However, pregnant women should discuss this with their doctor.
*   **Other Medications:**  There are generally no significant interactions with other medications, but it is always prudent to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
*   **Immune System Compromise:** The vaccine might be less effective for people with severely weakened immune systems, and they may benefit from additional consideration regarding their vaccination strategy.


### FAQs
*   **Q: How long does the vaccine last?**  A: Protection generally lasts for one flu season, so an annual vaccination is recommended.
*   **Q: Can I get the flu from this vaccine?**  A: No.  This vaccine contains inactivated (killed) viruses and cannot cause the flu.  However, it takes a few weeks for full immunity to develop.
*   **Q: What should I do if I develop side effects?**  A: Most side effects are mild.  Over-the-counter pain relievers may help.  If you have any serious or concerning side effects, contact your doctor.
*   **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A: The vaccine must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated at a specific temperature range.  Do not freeze.
*   **Q: Is the quadrivalent vaccine better than the trivalent vaccine?** A: The quadrivalent vaccine provides broader protection as it covers an additional influenza B strain.  However, both are effective in preventing flu.  The best choice depends on individual circumstances and availability.
