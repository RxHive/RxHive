# Ibritumomab Tiuxetan
### Generic Name
Ibritumomab Tiuxetan

### Usage

Ibritumomab tiuxetan is a radioimmunotherapy drug used to treat specific types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a cancer of the lymphatic system.  It's primarily used in two scenarios:

* **Relapsed or Refractory Low-Grade or Follicular B-cell NHL:** This means it's used when the lymphoma has returned after treatment (relapsed) or hasn't responded to previous treatments (refractory).

* **Previously Untreated Follicular NHL:** In some cases, it may be used as part of the initial treatment (first-line therapy) for follicular NHL, but only in patients who have shown a partial or complete response to their first-line chemotherapy.  It's administered in combination with rituximab.


It's crucial to understand that Ibritumomab tiuxetan is not a standalone treatment. It's always used in combination with rituximab, another monoclonal antibody.  The combination targets cancerous B-cells more effectively.


### Dosage

Ibritumomab tiuxetan dosage is complex and highly individualized, determined by a healthcare professional based on several factors including the patient's body weight, platelet count, and response to prior therapies.  The regimen involves the administration of both rituximab and then yttrium-90 ibritumomab.

**Adult Dosage (in combination with rituximab):**

* **Rituximab:** A dose of 250 mg/mÂ² is given intravenously (IV) on Day 1. The infusion rate is carefully controlled to minimize side effects.  A second dose of rituximab is given intravenously on Day 7, 8, or 9, again with a controlled infusion rate, prior to administering yttrium-90 ibritumomab.
* **Yttrium-90 Ibritumomab:** This radioactive component is administered intravenously within 4 hours of completing the rituximab infusion on Day 7, 8, or 9. The dose is calculated based on the patient's body weight and platelet count, aiming for a range of 0.3 to 0.4 mCi/kg, with a maximum dose of 32 mCi. Lower doses are given to patients with lower platelet counts to reduce the risk of bleeding.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Ibritumomab tiuxetan in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's label does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A physician will carefully assess the patient's condition to determine appropriate adjustments if needed.

### Side Effects

Ibritumomab tiuxetan, like other cancer treatments, can cause various side effects. These can range from mild to severe.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Infections

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**

* Severe cytopenias (very low blood cell counts)
* Infusion reactions (ranging from mild to life-threatening)
* Severe skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Secondary malignancies (leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome)
* Radiation injury (delayed effects)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Ibritumomab tiuxetan is a type of radioimmunotherapy.  It works by combining a monoclonal antibody (ibritumomab) that targets a protein called CD20 found on the surface of cancerous B-cells, with a radioactive isotope (yttrium-90).

The ibritumomab antibody acts like a "guided missile," binding to the CD20 protein on the lymphoma cells.  The attached yttrium-90 then delivers radiation directly to the cancer cells, damaging their DNA and leading to their death.  While the radiation primarily targets the cancerous cells, some radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues is possible.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Ibritumomab tiuxetan is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to its components, including rituximab.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  This drug can severely suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts.  Close monitoring of blood counts is essential.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Serious infusion reactions, including life-threatening events, can occur. Careful monitoring during infusion and premedication are necessary.
* **Other Medications:** Interactions with other medications are possible.  It's crucial to inform the doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:** While no specific dosage adjustments are given, pre-existing liver or kidney problems should be assessed before treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment is determined by the physician based on the individual patient's response.
* **Q: How is the drug stored?** A:  Storage instructions will be provided by the pharmacy.  It is typically stored under specific temperature conditions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your physician immediately.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects?** A: Long-term effects can include secondary cancers and other late-onset side effects. Regular follow-up appointments are important for monitoring.
* **Q: Is this treatment curative?** A:  Ibritumomab tiuxetan is not a cure for lymphoma, but it can lead to remission or improve survival.  Treatment goals are individualized.
