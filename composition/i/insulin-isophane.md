# Insulin Isophane

**Generic Name:** Insulin Isophane (NPH Insulin)

**Usage:**  Insulin Isophane (NPH insulin) is a type of intermediate-acting insulin used to control high blood sugar in people with diabetes mellitus.  It's typically used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It's usually injected subcutaneously (under the skin), once or twice a day, often in combination with a short-acting insulin or a long-acting insulin to better control blood sugar levels throughout the day and night. The timing of the injection needs to be carefully coordinated with meals and activities to avoid hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  The specific dosage and timing will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and blood glucose monitoring.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Insulin Isophane can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect. Symptoms can include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, rapid heartbeat, hunger, and blurred vision. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness or seizures.
* **Injection site reactions:** These can include redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:** Insulin can cause weight gain in some people.
* **Lipohypertrophy:**  This is a thickening of the fatty tissue at the injection site.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible. Symptoms can include rash, hives, itching, or swelling.


**How it Works:** Insulin Isophane is a suspension of insulin that is absorbed more slowly than regular insulin.  This provides a longer-lasting effect, typically lasting 12-18 hours. It works by lowering blood glucose levels by:

* **Facilitating glucose uptake:** Insulin helps glucose (sugar) move from the bloodstream into cells, where it can be used for energy.
* **Glycogen synthesis:** It promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles.
* **Inhibition of gluconeogenesis:** It reduces the production of glucose by the liver.
* **Inhibition of lipolysis:** It decreases the breakdown of fats.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I mix Insulin Isophane with other insulins?** A: Yes, it can often be mixed with regular (short-acting) insulin in the same syringe for administration.  However, it's crucial to follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully regarding mixing techniques and order of drawing up the insulin.  Never mix with long-acting insulins.
* **Q: How do I store Insulin Isophane?** A:  Store unopened vials in the refrigerator. Once opened, store at room temperature (below 86°F/30°C) and discard after the expiration date. Do not freeze.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience low blood sugar?** A:  Treat low blood sugar immediately with fast-acting carbohydrates such as glucose tablets, fruit juice, or candy.  Follow your doctor's instructions for managing hypoglycemia.
* **Q: Is Insulin Isophane right for me?** A:  Only a doctor can determine if Insulin Isophane is the appropriate treatment for your specific diabetes management needs.  They will consider your blood sugar levels, lifestyle, and other health factors.
