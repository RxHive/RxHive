# Iron Sucrose
### Generic Name
Iron Sucrose

### Usage
Iron sucrose is primarily used to treat iron deficiency anemia in adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), regardless of whether they are on hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or not undergoing dialysis.  It's crucial to understand that this medication addresses iron deficiency, not the underlying kidney disease itself.  While not its primary indication, iron sucrose has also been used off-label to treat chemotherapy-associated anemia.  This off-label use is often considered in patients who have experienced anemia as a side effect of chemotherapy, particularly platinum-based regimens.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** All dosages below are expressed in milligrams of elemental iron.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient response and clinical factors. Always follow your healthcare provider's specific instructions.

**Adults with CKD (Iron Deficiency Anemia):**

* **Hemodialysis-dependent:** 100 mg intravenously (IV) during consecutive dialysis sessions, typically totaling 1000 mg (10 doses).  Treatment may be repeated as needed.
* **Peritoneal dialysis-dependent:** Two 300 mg IV infusions 14 days apart, followed by a single 400 mg infusion 14 days later (total 1000 mg). Treatment may be repeated if necessary.
* **Non-dialysis-dependent:** 200 mg IV on 5 different occasions within a 14-day period (total 1000 mg). Alternative regimens may exist; consult your healthcare provider.

**Adults with Chemotherapy-Associated Anemia (Off-Label Use):**  Various regimens exist, including 200 mg every 3 weeks for 5 doses, or 100 mg weekly for 6 weeks followed by every-other-week dosing, or 200 mg after each chemotherapy cycle up to 6 doses.  Consult your oncologist for appropriate dosing.

**Pediatric Dosage (Iron Deficiency Anemia in CKD):**

Dosage is weight-based and varies depending on whether it's for repletion or maintenance therapy and the type of dialysis (if applicable). Always consult a pediatrician or nephrologist for appropriate pediatric dosing.  The calculations for iron deficit in non-renal causes in infants, children, and adolescents also involve detailed assessment of hemoglobin and weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for hepatic impairment.  In renal impairment (CKD), dosage adjustments are generally not necessary, as iron sucrose is used specifically in this population and is not dialyzable.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Nausea
* Muscle cramps
* Upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., common cold symptoms)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition)
* Injection site reactions

**Important:**  If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed above, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Iron sucrose provides iron, a vital component of hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells).  The sucrose acts as a carrier, facilitating the safe delivery of iron to the body's cells.  Once in the cells, the iron is incorporated into hemoglobin, improving oxygen-carrying capacity and addressing iron-deficiency anemia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Iron sucrose is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to it, iron overload (too much iron in the body), or anemia not caused by iron deficiency.
* **Interactions:** Iron sucrose can interact with several medications;  consult your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you're taking to prevent potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Iron sucrose is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only when clearly needed.  Excretion in breast milk isn't fully known, so caution is warranted.
* **Renal Impairment:** While iron sucrose is used for CKD, close monitoring is crucial due to the underlying renal condition.

**Administration Precautions:** Iron sucrose should be administered intravenously as a slow injection or infusion, never rapidly.  The rate of administration depends on the dose.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: Improvement in hemoglobin levels typically takes several weeks.
* **Q: How is iron sucrose stored?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, typically at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I take iron sucrose with other medications?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance; donâ€™t try to make up for a missed dose on your own.
* **Q: Is iron sucrose safe for children?** A: Yes, it's used in children with CKD under careful medical supervision. However, dosing is different and requires close monitoring by a pediatrician or nephrologist.
