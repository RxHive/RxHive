# Ingenol Mebutate
### Generic Name
Ingenol Mebutate

### Usage
Ingenol mebutate is a topical medication primarily used to treat actinic keratosis (AK), a common precancerous skin condition.  It's derived from the plant *Euphorbia peplus* and works by inducing cell death in the affected skin areas.  While primarily used for AK, it's important to note that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has suspended its license due to concerns about the risk of skin malignancy.  Therefore, its availability and use may be restricted in certain regions.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using this medication.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the location of the actinic keratosis lesions and the concentration of the gel.  The information below reflects past prescribing guidelines and may not reflect current availability or recommendations.  **Always consult a healthcare provider for current and accurate dosage information.**

* **Actinic keratosis (AK) on the face or scalp:**  0.015% gel is applied once daily (OD) to the affected area for three consecutive days.
* **Actinic keratosis (AK) on the trunk and extremities:** 0.05% gel is applied once daily (OD) to the affected area for two consecutive days.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of ingenol mebutate in children have not been established.

**Dosage adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment due to the low systemic absorption of the drug.  However, this should be discussed with a physician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Erythema (redness) of the skin
* Desquamation (peeling) and exfoliation (shedding) of skin
* Crusting of the skin
* Swelling of the skin
* Localized vesiculation (blistering) and pustules (pus-filled bumps)
* Dermal ulceration (sores)
* Skin erosion
* Application-site pain


Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Application-site pruritus (itching) and irritation
* Skin infection
* Headache
* Periorbital edema (swelling around the eyes)
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)


Rare or post-marketing reported side effects include:

* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Cicatrix (scarring) of the skin
* Chemical-induced conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye lining)
* Corneal injury (burn)
* Herpes zoster infection (shingles)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Injury to the eye region
* Pigmentation alteration
* Severe dermatological reactions
* Skin carcinoma (skin cancer)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)

**If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
The exact mechanism of action of ingenol mebutate in treating actinic keratosis is not fully understood.  However, it is believed to induce primary necrosis (cell death) of the AK lesions. This is followed by a neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response (involving white blood cells) and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, further eliminating remaining diseased cells and potentially preventing relapse.  In simpler terms, it triggers a process that leads to the destruction of abnormal skin cells.


### Precautions
* **Contraindicated:**  Ingenol mebutate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to ingenol mebutate or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased risk:** Patients using ingenol mebutate have an increased risk of developing skin malignancies, dermatological reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, and ocular toxicity.
* **Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of skin cancer.
* **Other precautions:** Avoid application near the mouth and lips, and avoid transfer to the periocular area (around the eyes). If accidental exposure occurs, flush with water and consult a healthcare professional.  Do not cover the treated area with bandages or occlusive dressings.


### FAQs
* **Q: How should I store ingenol mebutate?**  A:  Storage instructions should be found on the product label.  Generally, topical medications should be stored at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can I use ingenol mebutate during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?** A:  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally discouraged due to a lack of sufficient safety data.  Consult a healthcare professional before use.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Follow the prescribed dosing schedule.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.  If you have questions or concerns, consult a healthcare provider.
* **Q:  Can I use other topical treatments on the same skin area while using ingenol mebutate?** A:  No, avoid using other topical medications on the treated area unless directed by your healthcare provider.  This can interfere with the medication's effectiveness and potentially lead to adverse reactions.
* **Q: Is ingenol mebutate available everywhere?** A:  Due to safety concerns and the EMA suspension, its availability may vary significantly across different regions. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about its availability in your area.
