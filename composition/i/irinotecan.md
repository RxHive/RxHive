# Irinotecan

**Generic Name:** Irinotecan hydrochloride

**Usage:** Irinotecan is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including:

* **Colorectal cancer:**  Often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, either as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer or in later-line settings.
* **Small cell lung cancer:** Sometimes used in combination with other treatments.
* **Ovarian cancer:** May be part of a combination regimen.
* **Other cancers:**  It has also been investigated in clinical trials for other cancers, though its widespread use is primarily in colorectal and lung cancers.  The specific use and regimen will depend entirely on the type and stage of cancer, and the physician's assessment of the patient's condition.

**Side Effects:**  Irinotecan can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity from person to person.  Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea (often severe and potentially life-threatening), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation.
* **Hematologic:** Low white blood cell count (neutropenia), low red blood cell count (anemia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).  This increases the risk of infection, bleeding, and fatigue.
* **Fatigue:**  A very common side effect.
* **Hair loss (alopecia):**  Can be temporary or permanent.
* **Myelosuppression:** Bone marrow suppression leading to decreased blood cell production.
* **Early and delayed cholinergic effects:** These can include sweating, salivation, tearing, abdominal cramps, blurred vision, and slowed heart rate.  These often occur early in treatment but can also be delayed.
* **Infections:** Due to the immunosuppressive effects.
* **Severe allergic reactions:** Although rare.

**How it Works:** Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.  Topoisomerase I is an enzyme essential for DNA replication and repair.  By inhibiting this enzyme, irinotecan prevents cancer cells from dividing and multiplying, ultimately leading to cell death.  The active metabolite, SN-38, is responsible for most of irinotecan's anti-cancer activity.
