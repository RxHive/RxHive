# Indomethacin

**Generic Name:** Indomethacin

**Usage:** Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation.  Its uses include:

* **Treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis:**  It helps reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.
* **Acute gouty arthritis:** It helps reduce the pain and inflammation associated with gout attacks.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:**  It can alleviate pain and inflammation in this type of arthritis affecting the spine.
* **Tendinitis and bursitis:** It can reduce pain and inflammation in these conditions.
* **Closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in newborns:**  This is a more specialized use requiring close medical supervision.  It's administered intravenously for this purpose.
* **Other inflammatory conditions:**  It may be used to treat other inflammatory conditions, although this is less common and usually under close medical supervision.


**Side Effects:**  Like other NSAIDs, indomethacin can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal (GI) problems:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, ulcers, bleeding, and perforation (rare but serious).
* **Headache:** A frequent side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Can affect coordination and balance.
* **Fluid retention:**  Can lead to swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs.
* **High blood pressure:**  Can exacerbate existing hypertension.
* **Increased risk of cardiovascular events:** Heart attack, stroke, and blood clots.
* **Kidney problems:**  Can impair kidney function, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare but possible.
* **Blood disorders:**  Rare but potentially serious.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction).


**How it Works:** Indomethacin works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation. By reducing prostaglandin production, indomethacin helps to alleviate these symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **Is indomethacin addictive?** No, indomethacin is not addictive.
* **Can I take indomethacin with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.  Some medications, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners), can increase the risk of bleeding when taken with indomethacin.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **How long does it take to work?** The onset of pain relief can vary, but it often takes several days to see significant improvement.
* **Should I avoid alcohol while taking indomethacin?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol while taking indomethacin.
* **Can I take indomethacin during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Indomethacin should generally be avoided during pregnancy, especially in the later stages, due to potential risks to the fetus.  Its use during breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor.
* **What are the signs of a serious side effect?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe stomach pain, black or bloody stools, signs of allergic reaction (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), chest pain, or other concerning symptoms.
