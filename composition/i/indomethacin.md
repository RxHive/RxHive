# Indomethacin
### Generic Name
Indomethacin

### Usage
Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat moderate to severe pain and inflammation associated with various conditions.  Its primary uses include:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  Managing the pain and inflammation of this chronic autoimmune disease, including acute flares.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:**  Treating the pain and inflammation characteristic of this inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine.
* **Osteoarthritis:**  Alleviating pain and inflammation in this degenerative joint disease.
* **Acute gouty arthritis:**  Providing relief from the sudden, severe joint pain and inflammation associated with gout attacks.
* **Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis):** Reducing pain and inflammation in shoulder conditions like bursitis and tendinitis.

In neonates (premature infants), indomethacin has a specific, albeit limited, use:  closing a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) – an abnormal connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery – when standard medical management fails. This is an off-label use.  Other off-label uses exist, such as tocolysis (delaying preterm labor), and prevention of pancreatitis following specific procedures, but these should only be considered under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and the medication's formulation (oral, rectal, or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  The information below is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:** Doses range from 25 mg to 200 mg daily, divided into several doses or as a single dose depending on the formulation and the condition.  Extended-release formulations allow for less frequent dosing. Specific dosing regimens for different conditions are complex and should be determined by a physician.

**Children:** Use in children is generally limited to those aged 2 years and older, with dosages carefully calculated based on weight (typically 1-2 mg/kg/day in divided doses) and under strict medical supervision.

**Special Populations:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function, and the use of indomethacin is often contraindicated in cases of severe impairment.  Pregnant women should avoid indomethacin, especially in the third trimester due to the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.  Breastfeeding mothers should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using this medication.


### Side Effects

Indomethacin, like other NSAIDs, can cause a range of side effects.  These vary in frequency and severity:

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Indigestion
* Heartburn
* Constipation or diarrhea
* Abdominal pain

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems
* Cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke)
* Blood disorders (anemia, reduced platelet function)

If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking indomethacin and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Indomethacin works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, molecules that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, indomethacin decreases pain and inflammation.  It's important to note that the exact mechanisms contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects are still being researched and may involve other pathways beyond COX inhibition.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Indomethacin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, active peptic ulcers, severe liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled heart failure, and during the third trimester of pregnancy.  It should also be avoided in patients with a history of asthma triggered by aspirin or other NSAIDs and in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:** Indomethacin can interact with many other medications, including other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and certain diuretics.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Indomethacin carries a risk of serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications. Individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or gastrointestinal problems should use caution. Regular monitoring may be necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take indomethacin with alcohol?** A: It is generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking indomethacin, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* **Q: How should I store indomethacin?** A: Store indomethacin at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I stop taking indomethacin suddenly?** A: No, it's important to follow your doctor's instructions for stopping indomethacin. Abrupt cessation could potentially worsen symptoms or lead to other complications.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose to catch up.
* **Q: Is indomethacin addictive?** A: Indomethacin is not considered an addictive drug. However, long-term use should be under medical supervision.
