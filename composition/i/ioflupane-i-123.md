# Ioflupane I 123
### Generic Name
Ioflupane I 123

### Usage
Ioflupane I 123 is a radiopharmaceutical used in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging.  Its primary use is to visualize the dopamine transporter (DaT) in the striatum, a brain region crucial for movement control. This imaging helps in the evaluation of adult patients suspected of having Parkinsonian syndromes (PS).  Parkinsonian syndromes encompass a group of neurological disorders characterized by similar motor symptoms to Parkinson's disease, including  idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.  The scan helps differentiate between these conditions and essential tremor, which presents with similar shaking but has a different underlying cause.

### Dosage
**Dopamine transporter visualization (Adults):** The recommended intravenous (IV) dose is 111-185 MBq (3-5 mCi).  Administration should be slow, over at least 15-20 seconds.  Importantly, thyroid-protective agents like potassium iodide (SSKI) or Lugol's solution (equivalent to 100 mg iodide or 400 mg potassium perchlorate) must be given at least one hour before Ioflupane I 123 administration. SPECT imaging typically begins 3-6 hours post-injection.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Ioflupane I 123 is not approved for use in children.  Safety and efficacy haven't been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However, because Ioflupane I 123 is excreted by the kidneys, patients with severe renal impairment may experience increased radiation exposure and altered SPECT image results.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (frequency not specified in available data) may include dizziness, headache, nausea, itching (pruritus), skin rash, vertigo, and dry mouth (xerostomia).  While rare, serious adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions are possible. If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Ioflupane I 123 is a radiotracer that binds specifically to the dopamine transporter (DaT) in the brain.  Areas with high DaT density (like the striatum in healthy individuals) will show increased uptake of the radiotracer, which is then detected by the SPECT scan.  In Parkinson's disease and related conditions, dopamine neurons degenerate, leading to reduced DaT density in the striatum.  The SPECT image thus reflects the level of DaT activity, aiding in the diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ioflupane I 123 is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Ioflupane I 123, any component of its formulation, or iodine.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of iodine or iodine contrast agent hypersensitivity and in patients with severe renal impairment.  It's crucial to evaluate pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential before administration.  Radioactive iodine crosses the placenta and may harm the developing fetus; the use of a thyroid-blocking agent is recommended to protect both mother and fetus if Ioflupane I 123 is necessary during pregnancy.  Breastfeeding may need to be interrupted or the medication discontinued due to unknown excretion in breast milk; consult a healthcare provider.

**Drug Interactions:** Several medications, including antidepressants (e.g., amoxapine, bupropion, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, serotonin/norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors), stimulants (e.g., amphetamines, methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate),  antiparkinsonian drugs (e.g., benztropine, selegiline), and others (e.g., buspirone, fentanyl, cocaine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine) may diminish the diagnostic effect of Ioflupane I 123. Careful monitoring is needed when these medications are used concurrently.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Ioflupane I 123 administered?**  A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as a slow injection.

* **Q: How long does it take to get the results of the scan?** A: SPECT imaging typically begins 3-6 hours after the injection.
