# Iobenguane
### Generic Name
Iobenguane I 123

### Usage
Iobenguane I 123 is a radiopharmaceutical used as an adjunctive diagnostic agent in locating primary or metastatic pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas.  It's primarily used in nuclear medicine imaging (scintigraphy) to visualize these tumors.  These tumors are neuroendocrine tumors that can secrete hormones leading to serious health problems. Iobenguane I 123 helps pinpoint their location before other treatment strategies.  In addition, it may be used to assess myocardial sympathetic innervation in patients with specific types of heart failure.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The recommended dose is typically 0.5 mCi. However, for obese patients with a body surface area over 1.7 m² (approximately 65 kg), the dose should be adjusted to 0.3 mCi/m² up to a maximum of 1.0 mCi.  The dosage is administered intravenously.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children varies significantly based on weight and is usually determined by a physician specializing in nuclear medicine. The information provided in the original source lists a range of doses from 1 mCi to 10 mCi depending on the child's weight.  It's crucial to follow the specific dosage instructions provided by a healthcare professional.  Use in neonates (less than one month old) is not established as safe or effective.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Caution is advised when using iobenguane I 123 in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment.  The drug is cleared by glomerular filtration and is not dialyzable.


### Side Effects

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Sleepiness
*   Fever
*   Chills


While less common, more serious side effects are possible.  It's crucial to report any adverse effects to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Iobenguane I 123 is taken up by adrenergic neurons and chromaffin cells through a process called active transport, similar to how the body handles catecholamines.  Because pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas concentrate these cells, the iobenguane I 123 accumulates in these tumors.  This accumulation can then be detected using a special camera in a process called scintigraphy, allowing for visualization of the tumor location.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Iobenguane I 123 is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to iobenguane sulfate and in patients without kidney function (anephric).

**Interactions:**  Several medications may interact with Iobenguane I 123, potentially diminishing its effectiveness. These include alpha2-agonists, various antidepressants (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants), cocaine, methyldopa, reserpine, and sympathomimetics.  Consult with a healthcare professional about any medications you are currently taking before receiving iobenguane I 123.

**Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Patients should be well-hydrated before administration.  Only qualified nuclear physicians and radiopharmacists should handle and administer this medication.  The precise dose must be measured immediately before administration using calibrated equipment.  Pregnancy Category C – use with caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Iobenguane I 123 administered?** A: It is administered intravenously.
*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: Imaging typically occurs 24 hours (±6 hours) after administration for pheochromocytoma or neuroblastoma.  For heart failure assessment, imaging may be done at 4 hours (±10 minutes).
*   **Q: How should Iobenguane I 123 be stored?** A: It should be stored frozen at -20°C to -10°C. Allow it to reach room temperature for 30 minutes before administration.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, to your doctor immediately.
*   **Q: Is Iobenguane I 123 safe?** A: Like all medications, there are potential risks. A healthcare professional will assess your individual situation to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks.
