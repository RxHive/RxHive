# Iopromide
### Generic Name
Iopromide

### Usage

Iopromide is a non-ionic, water-soluble contrast medium used in various medical imaging procedures.  Its primary use is as a radiographic contrast agent to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and other structures during X-ray examinations. This makes it invaluable for a range of diagnostic procedures.

Specifically, iopromide is used in:

* **Angiography:**  Including cerebral arteriography (brain blood vessels), peripheral arteriography (limb blood vessels), coronary arteriography (heart blood vessels), and visceral angiography (abdominal organ blood vessels).  It allows doctors to visualize the blood vessels for the detection of blockages, aneurysms, or other abnormalities.
* **Excretory Urography:**  An X-ray examination of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder to assess their structure and function.
* **Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT):**  CT scans use X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the body. Iopromide improves the contrast in these images, making it easier to visualize organs, blood vessels, and other structures, particularly in the head and body.


### Dosage

Iopromide dosage is highly variable and depends significantly on the specific imaging procedure, the patient's age, weight, renal function, and the area being examined.  The following information is for illustrative purposes only and should **not** be interpreted as a prescription.  **Always follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.**

**Adult Dosage (Examples):**  Dosage is typically expressed as the amount of iodine (in mg) per milliliter (mL) of the solution and the total volume administered.  The concentration of iodine in iopromide solutions varies (e.g., 300 mg iodine/mL, 370 mg iodine/mL).

* **Digital Subtraction Angiography:**  Doses range from a few milliliters to 50 mL, depending on the specific vessels being examined.  Cumulative doses are typically limited.
* **Cerebral Arteriography:**  Doses typically range from 3-12 mL per injection, with cumulative dose limits.
* **Excretory Urography (IV):**  Dosage is often based on body weight (e.g., ~300 mg iodine/kg) but is adjusted for renal function.
* **Contrast CT:** Doses range significantly depending on the area being scanned (head vs. body) and the method of administration (bolus injection vs. rapid infusion).  Cumulative dose limits apply.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of iopromide in children under 2 years of age have not been established. Dosing for older children is generally lower than adult doses and is carefully adjusted based on weight and the specific procedure.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.  Healthcare professionals carefully assess the patient's condition and reduce the dose accordingly to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or more):**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Feeling warm
* Injection site reactions

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild hives to life-threatening anaphylaxis)
* Acute kidney injury
* Cardiovascular events (e.g., abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack)
* Seizures
* Severe skin reactions


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Iopromide is a radiopaque contrast agent.  This means it absorbs X-rays more efficiently than the surrounding tissues. When injected into the bloodstream or administered intravenously, iopromide temporarily increases the density of blood vessels and other structures, making them distinctly visible on X-ray images. This allows for clear visualization of the target area during the imaging procedure. The mechanism of action is based purely on its physical property of X-ray absorption.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Iopromide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to iopromide or other iodinated contrast media.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with impaired kidney function as iopromide can increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
* **Cardiac Disease:** Use with caution in patients with significant cardiovascular disease.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Iopromide is categorized as pregnancy category B. While the risk to the fetus is considered relatively low, the decision to use iopromide during pregnancy should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits against potential risks. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Medications:** Iopromide can interact with other medications, potentially increasing the risk of certain side effects. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Thyroid Disease:** Patients with thyroid disease may require special precautions.
* **Hydration:** Adequate hydration before and after administration is recommended to help prevent kidney problems.

**Boxed Warning:** Iopromide is strictly contraindicated for intrathecal (spinal) administration.  Accidental intrathecal injection can have severe, life-threatening consequences.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for iopromide to be eliminated from the body?** A: Most of the iopromide is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours.  The rate of elimination can vary based on renal function.
* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions before or after an iopromide-enhanced imaging procedure?** A: Usually, no specific dietary restrictions are necessary, unless advised otherwise by your healthcare professional.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.
* **Q: How is iopromide stored?** A:  Store iopromide as directed by the manufacturer, typically at room temperature and away from direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can iopromide be used in all types of imaging procedures?** A: No, iopromide is specifically used in procedures where improved visualization of blood vessels or other structures is needed.  It's not suitable for all imaging techniques.
