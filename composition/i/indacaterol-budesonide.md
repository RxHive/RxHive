# Indacaterol + Budesonide

**Generic Name:** Indacaterol/Budesonide

**Usage:**

Indacaterol/Budesonide is a combination inhaler used to prevent and treat airflow obstruction in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's not used for the treatment of acute bronchospasm (sudden shortness of breath).  It is typically prescribed for patients who require both a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) to manage their COPD symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Sore throat
* Muscle pain
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Tremors (shaking)
* Yeast infection in the mouth (thrush)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Irregular heartbeat
* Increased blood pressure
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing) - this is a reason to immediately stop use and seek medical attention.
* Pneumonia
* Osteoporosis (with long-term use)
* Cataracts or glaucoma (although evidence is not conclusive)


**How it Works:**

This combination medication contains two active ingredients that work in different ways to improve lung function:

* **Indacaterol (LABA):**  Relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  This effect lasts for 24 hours.
* **Budesonide (ICS):** Reduces inflammation in the airways, preventing swelling and mucus production. This helps to prevent exacerbations (worsening of COPD symptoms).


**FAQs:**

* **How often should I use it?**  Typically, one inhalation once daily, at the same time each day.  Never use more than prescribed.
* **Can I use it if I have other health conditions?**  Inform your doctor of all your medical conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, glaucoma, or osteoporosis before starting this medication.  It may not be suitable for everyone.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I use this medication with other inhalers?**  Your doctor will advise you on using this medication alongside other medications.  Do not start or stop any medication without their advice.
* **What are the symptoms of an allergic reaction?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.
* **How should I store it?**  Store the inhaler as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **How long will it take to work?**  You may notice some improvement in your breathing within a few days, but the full benefit may take several weeks.  Regular use is crucial.
