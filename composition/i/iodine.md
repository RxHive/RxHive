# Iodine
### Generic Name
Iodine

### Usage

Iodine is primarily used as a topical antiseptic to prevent infection in minor wounds such as cuts, scrapes, and burns.  It's also employed for preoperative skin disinfection before surgical procedures to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.  Additionally, iodine solutions are used to clean and treat infected wounds like ulcers (including those caused by pressure sores or venous stasis) by reducing infection and promoting healing.  The specific formulation (e.g., tincture, ointment, gel, pad) influences the application method and the type of wound it's best suited for.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the iodine formulation and the intended use.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.  General guidelines include:

* **Minor cuts, scrapes, and burns (topical antiseptic):**  A small amount of 2% or 2.5% tincture or ointment is applied directly to the affected area 1-3 times daily.

* **Preoperative antisepsis (topical):** The solution is applied to the surgical site before the procedure.  Once dry, it's removed with 70% alcohol.

* **Wound cleansing (topical):**  For gels and pads containing cadexomer iodine (0.9%), application varies depending on the wound's size and exudate. A maximum of 50g per application and 150g per week is generally recommended. Dressings should be changed about three times a week, reducing the frequency as the wound heals.  Treatment should not exceed three months or continue once the wound is free of exudate.

* **Pediatric Dosage:** For minor wounds, the topical application is generally the same as for adults, but always consult a pediatrician before using iodine on children.

Specific instructions for dosage and frequency are always found on the product packaging.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and localized:

* Local irritation
* Local pain
* Localized edema (swelling)
* Erythema (redness)
* Eczema

Less common, but more serious, side effects include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (affecting thyroid function)

If any adverse effects occur, especially if they are severe or persistent, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Iodine's antiseptic properties stem from its ability to disrupt the function of proteins and nucleic acids in microorganisms, effectively killing bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. In wound care, preparations like cadexomer iodine release iodine slowly, allowing for prolonged antimicrobial action and the absorption of wound exudate (fluid).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Iodine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to iodine, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a history of Graves' disease or nontoxic nodular goiter, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. It should not be used on dry wounds.
* **Interactions:**  Iodine can interact with certain medications, such as lithium salts, antithyroid agents, potassium-containing drugs, and potassium-sparing diuretics.  Concurrent use should be avoided or carefully managed under a doctor's supervision. It can also interfere with the effectiveness of radioactive iodine (I-131) used in some medical treatments.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.  Avoid contact with eyes. Always wash hands thoroughly before and after use.  Overuse or application to large areas of the body can lead to absorption of iodine, potentially affecting thyroid function. Avoid use with airtight bandages.  For OTC use, it's not suitable for deep wounds, puncture wounds, animal bites, or serious burns without consulting a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I use iodine topically?** A:  The duration of topical iodine use depends on the wound type and healing progress. For minor wounds, it may be used for a few days to a week. For wound cleansing, it shouldn't exceed three months, or continue beyond when the wound is free of exudate.  Always follow product instructions.

* **Q: Can I use iodine on a deep wound?** A: No, deep wounds, puncture wounds, or serious burns require professional medical attention. Do not use iodine on these without consulting a doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get iodine in my eyes?** A: Immediately flush your eyes with plenty of clean water and seek medical advice if irritation persists.

* **Q: How should I store iodine?** A: Store iodine as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is iodine safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A: No, iodine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor for safe alternatives.
