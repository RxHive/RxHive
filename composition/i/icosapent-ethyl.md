# Icosapent ethyl

**Generic Name:** Icosapent Ethyl

**Usage:** Icosapent ethyl is used to lower triglyceride levels in the blood.  It's prescribed to adults with very high triglyceride levels (â‰¥500 mg/dL) to reduce the risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). It may also be used to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults with elevated triglycerides and established cardiovascular disease.  **It is important to note that icosapent ethyl is not a first-line treatment for high triglycerides. Lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise should always be attempted first.**

**Side Effects:** Common side effects of icosapent ethyl include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  These are the most frequently reported side effects and can include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and belching.
* **Bleeding:** Increased risk of bleeding, especially in individuals already taking anticoagulants (blood thinners).
* **Muscle pain (myalgia):**  While not extremely common, muscle pain can occur.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.
* **Increased risk of atrial fibrillation:** Some studies suggest a possible increased risk of atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), although this is a subject of ongoing research and debate.


**How it Works:** Icosapent ethyl is a type of omega-3 fatty acid. It works by increasing the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ("good" cholesterol) and decreasing the levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides.  The exact mechanism by which it reduces cardiovascular risk is not fully understood but is believed to be related to its anti-inflammatory and anti-arrhythmic properties, in addition to its effects on lipid levels.
