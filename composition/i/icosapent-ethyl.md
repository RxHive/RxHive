# Icosapent Ethyl
### Generic Name
Icosapent Ethyl

### Usage

Icosapent ethyl is an omega-3 fatty acid used primarily to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults.  It's used as an add-on to a statin medication (when a patient is already taking the maximum tolerated dose of a statin) for individuals with high triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes with at least two additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  The goal is to lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and hospitalization for unstable angina.

Secondly, icosapent ethyl is also used to lower triglyceride levels in adults with very high triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL), often referred to as severe hypertriglyceridemia. In this case, it's used in conjunction with dietary changes.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Icosapent ethyl should always be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise.  Underlying causes of high lipid levels should be investigated before starting treatment.

* **Cardiovascular risk reduction (with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia, used in addition to statins):** The typical dose is 2 grams twice daily (4 grams total), taken with meals.  This is usually in capsule form (available as 0.5g or 1g capsules).
* **Severe Hypertriglyceridemia:**  The dosage is the same as above (2 grams twice daily) but used to specifically reduce triglyceride levels.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of icosapent ethyl in children haven't been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for people with liver or kidney problems, according to current prescribing information.  However,  individual responses to medication can vary, so it is important to consult with a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Bleeding (Hemorrhage)


**Less Common but Important Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
* Atrial flutter (rapid heartbeat)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Constipation
* Gout
* Musculoskeletal pain


**Other Side Effects (frequency not clearly defined):**

* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
* Abdominal distress
* Diarrhea
* Increased serum triglycerides (paradoxically, in some individuals)
* Limb pain


**Serious Side Effects:** While less common, serious side effects are possible.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual symptoms, especially those related to bleeding or heart rhythm disturbances.



### How it Works

Icosapent ethyl is a type of omega-3 fatty acid.  It works by reducing the liver's production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, a type of fat that contributes to high triglycerides.  The exact mechanisms aren't fully understood, but it involves influencing enzymes involved in triglyceride production and increasing the breakdown of triglycerides in the liver.  While its direct effect on triglyceride levels is clear, its contribution to reducing cardiovascular events is likely multifactorial, involving various changes in blood vessels and platelets.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Icosapent ethyl is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (such as an allergic reaction) to icosapent ethyl or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of bleeding and atrial fibrillation or flutter, particularly in those with a history of these conditions.
* **Cautious Use:** Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders, known allergies to fish or shellfish, and older adults.
* **Drug Interactions:** Icosapent ethyl can increase the effects of other blood thinners or antiplatelet drugs.  Careful monitoring is necessary if taking these medications concurrently.  It may also interact with Ibrutinib.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Icosapent ethyl is classified as Category C in pregnancy.  While adequate omega-3 fatty acid intake is generally recommended during pregnancy, use of icosapent ethyl should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor.  Omega-3 fatty acids are present in breast milk, so potential infant exposure should be considered.
