# Iohexol
### Generic Name
Iohexol

### Usage

Iohexol is a radiographic contrast agent.  This means it's used to enhance the visibility of internal structures during medical imaging procedures, primarily X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans. Its uses are diverse, spanning various anatomical areas and imaging techniques:


* **Intrathecal Use (Spinal Canal):** Primarily used in myelography to visualize the spinal cord and surrounding structures.  This helps diagnose conditions affecting the spinal cord, nerves, or cerebrospinal fluid.

* **Intravascular Use (Blood Vessels):**  Widely employed in angiography (imaging of blood vessels) to examine arteries and veins in various parts of the body, including the brain (cerebral angiography), heart (coronary angiography), and peripheral vessels. It's also used in CT scans to enhance the visualization of blood vessels in the head and body.

* **Oral and Rectal Use:** Used in CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis to opacify (make visible) the bowel loops. This aids in distinguishing between normal bowel and adjacent organs or areas of suspected pathology.  It can be used alone or in conjunction with intravenous Iohexol.

* **Intra-articular Use (Joints):**  Iohexol can be injected directly into joints (arthrography) to visualize joint structures and diagnose conditions like arthritis or injuries.

* **Body Cavity Use:**  Used to visualize various body cavities, such as in hysterosalpingography (imaging of the uterus and fallopian tubes).


### Dosage

Iohexol dosages are highly variable and depend heavily on the specific imaging procedure, the patient's age, weight, and overall health, and the concentration of the Iohexol solution used.  The information below is a summary and should **not** be used for actual dosing.  **Always refer to the specific product labeling and consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosage.**  The dosage information provided in the original source is extensive and complex; a thorough review of the original document is recommended.


**Adult Dosage:**  The original source provides detailed dosing instructions for numerous applications (myelography, ventriculography, coronary arteriography, aortography, CT scans of the head and body, etc.), each with specific concentration, volume, and administration rate recommendations.  Units are often given in grams of iodine (gI) or milligrams of iodine (mgI), which reflects the iodine content in the Iohexol solution.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Similar to adult dosage, pediatric dosing for Iohexol is also procedure-specific and depends on the child's age and weight. The original source offers detailed instructions for various applications, with dosage ranges given for different age groups.  Again, the provided information is extensive, and a careful review of the original is essential.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided information does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use in patients with these conditions requires caution, and the lowest effective dose should be used.


### Side Effects

Iohexol, like other contrast agents, can cause several side effects, ranging from mild to severe.


**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Localized warmth at the injection site
* Pain at the injection site
* Cardiac arrhythmia
* Vision disturbances
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Lower limb cramps


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in <10% of patients):**

*  Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin rash to severe anaphylaxis)
*  Kidney problems (acute kidney injury)
*  Nervous system effects (seizures, confusion)
*  Cardiovascular problems (heart attack, stroke)


**Post-Marketing Side Effects:**  A wide range of additional side effects have been reported after the drug's initial release.  These include serious conditions affecting various organ systems (nervous system, cardiovascular, respiratory, etc.).


**Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Iohexol is an iodinated contrast medium. The iodine atoms in its molecule absorb X-rays effectively.  When Iohexol is injected or ingested, it increases the radiodensity of the tissues or organs it enters, making them appear brighter on X-ray images or CT scans. This improved contrast helps clinicians visualize internal structures more clearly and accurately diagnose various medical conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Iohexol is contraindicated (should not be used) in certain situations, including specific pregnancy-related circumstances for hysterosalpingography, and for intrathecal use with certain Iohexol formulations.

* **Interactions:** Interactions may occur with certain medications, such as MAO inhibitors, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and others.  A healthcare professional should be consulted about potential drug interactions.

* **Warnings/Precautions:**  Iohexol should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, kidney impairment, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, pheochromocytoma, epilepsy, sickle-cell disease, and the elderly.  There are specific precautions for different routes of administration (e.g., intravenous, intrathecal).  The original source highlights numerous safety considerations.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The use of Iohexol is contraindicated in certain pregnancy-related circumstances.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, but it's excreted in very low amounts. Healthcare providers should assess the risks and benefits of using Iohexol in pregnant or lactating women.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Iohexol stored?**
A:  Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.  Generally, contrast media should be stored at room temperature, protected from light.


**Q:  Is Iohexol safe?**
A: Iohexol is generally considered safe when used correctly, but like all medications, it can have side effects.  A healthcare professional will assess your health status and determine if it's appropriate for you.


**Q: What should I do if I have a reaction to Iohexol?**
A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any adverse reaction, particularly severe ones such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or a severe rash.


**Q: Can I take Iohexol with other medications?**
A:  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and supplements) you are taking before undergoing any procedure using Iohexol.
