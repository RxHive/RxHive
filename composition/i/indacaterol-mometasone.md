# Indacaterol + Mometasone
### Generic Name
Indacaterol + Mometasone

### Usage
Indacaterol/mometasone is a combination inhaled medication primarily used for the long-term maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's also used to prevent symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness associated with COPD.  This combination therapy is particularly beneficial because it addresses two key aspects of COPD:  Indacaterol, a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), helps relax the airways, making it easier to breathe. Mometasone, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), reduces inflammation in the lungs, thus minimizing airway irritation and mucus production. While not a primary use, some formulations may be used for the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients inadequately controlled on an ICS alone; however, this is generally not its first-line treatment.

### Dosage
Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific formulation and the patient's needs.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose.  Generally:

* **Adults (COPD):**  The usual dose is one inhalation of a single dose once daily. The specific strength of the inhaler will be prescribed by a doctor.

* **Children:**  Indacaterol/mometasone is not typically prescribed for children.  Asthma and COPD in children are usually managed with different medications.

* **Oral/IV administration:** Indacaterol/mometasone is administered via inhalation only, not orally or intravenously.  Proper inhaler technique is crucial for effectiveness.  A healthcare provider should demonstrate the correct technique to ensure the medication reaches the lungs efficiently.

* **Dosage adjustments:**  The dosage should not be changed without consulting a doctor.  Factors such as the severity of the condition and the patient's response to treatment might influence dose adjustments.  Older adults or patients with underlying conditions may require careful monitoring and adjusted dosages as needed.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Throat irritation
* Cough
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
*  Muscle aches


Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Increased risk of pneumonia (especially in patients with COPD)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)
* Worsening of existing heart conditions
* Osteoporosis (long-term use)
* Glaucoma
* Cataracts
* Oral thrush (fungal infection of the mouth)

**Important:**  If any significant or unexpected side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Indacaterol/mometasone works by combining two different mechanisms of action:

* **Indacaterol (LABA):** This long-acting beta2-agonist binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs. This stimulation leads to relaxation of the airway muscles, resulting in bronchodilation (widening of the airways), and thus easier breathing.  The effect lasts for a prolonged period.

* **Mometasone (ICS):** This inhaled corticosteroid is a potent anti-inflammatory.  It works by suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators in the lungs, reducing swelling and irritation of the airways. This, in turn, helps control the inflammation that contributes to COPD symptoms.

The combination provides both bronchodilation and inflammation control, offering a more comprehensive approach to managing COPD symptoms.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by people with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to indacaterol, mometasone, or any other component of the inhaler.
* **Drug interactions:**  Inform your healthcare provider about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as some interactions might occur.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Consult your healthcare provider before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Older adults:**  Older adults may be at a higher risk for side effects, requiring careful monitoring.
* **Children:**  Not recommended for use in children.
* **Heart conditions:** Patients with heart conditions should be carefully monitored.
* **Diabetes:**  Monitor blood sugar levels more closely if you have diabetes.
* **Glaucoma and Cataracts:**  Regular eye exams are advised for long-term users.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: You should start feeling the effects of the medication within a short period after inhalation, but the full benefits might take a few days or weeks to become apparent.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: No, always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.  Sudden discontinuation can worsen your condition.  

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store the inhaler as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from heat, moisture, and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.


* **Q: Is it addictive?** A:  Indacaterol/mometasone is not addictive in the same way as opioids or other substances of abuse, but it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions for proper use.
