# Indacaterol + Mometasone

**Generic Name:** Indacaterol/Mometasone furoate

**Usage:**

Indacaterol/Mometasone furoate is a combination medication used to prevent and treat airflow obstruction in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It is *not* used for the treatment of asthma.  It's a maintenance medication, meaning it's taken regularly to help control symptoms, not for quick relief during an acute attack.  The combination therapy provides both bronchodilation (opens airways) and anti-inflammatory effects.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Throat irritation
* Back pain
* Sinusitis
* Muscle pain
* Flu-like symptoms

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* **Increased risk of pneumonia:**  Patients should be aware of symptoms such as increased cough or sputum production.
* **Paradoxical bronchospasm:**  A worsening of breathing symptoms after taking the medication.  This is rare but requires immediate medical attention.
* **Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):** This is more likely in patients with pre-existing diabetes.
* **Candidiasis (thrush):**  A fungal infection of the mouth and throat.
* **Osteoporosis (increased risk with long-term use):** Especially relevant for patients already at risk for osteoporosis.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions):** Including rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

Indacaterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  Mometasone furoate is a corticosteroid.  It reduces inflammation in the airways, preventing the swelling and narrowing that contribute to COPD symptoms.  The combination of these two medications provides both bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory effects, offering better symptom control than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **How is it administered?**  Indacaterol/Mometasone furoate is typically administered via inhalation using a dry powder inhaler (DPI).  Patients should carefully follow the instructions provided with their inhaler.
* **How often should I take it?**  This medication is usually taken once daily, at the same time each day.  **Never adjust the dose without consulting your doctor.**
* **Can I use this for quick relief?** No, this is a maintenance medication and not for the treatment of acute COPD exacerbations (sudden worsening of symptoms).  You will need a separate "rescue inhaler" for that.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects or if your symptoms worsen.
* **Can I take this with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.
* **Is this medication safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may worsen your symptoms.
