# Indapamide
### Generic Name
Indapamide

### Usage

Indapamide is primarily used to treat mild to moderate high blood pressure (hypertension). It can be used alone or in combination with other blood pressure-lowering medications.  A secondary use is to treat edema (swelling) associated with congestive heart failure.  While not a typical use, it's sometimes used off-label to manage calcium kidney stones (nephrolithiasis).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies based on the condition being treated and the formulation (immediate-release or sustained-release).  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Hypertension (Immediate-Release):**  The usual starting dose is 1.25 mg once daily.  This can be increased to a maximum of 5 mg daily, but only after consulting with your doctor and adjusting the dosage gradually over several weeks.
* **Hypertension (Sustained-Release):** A typical dose is 1.5 mg once daily.
* **Edema in Congestive Heart Failure (Immediate-Release):**  Treatment usually begins with 2.5 mg daily.  Your doctor may increase this to 5 mg daily if needed after a week, depending on your response to treatment.
* **Dosage Adjustments for Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are needed for people with reduced kidney function.  For immediate-release, the dose may remain 1.25-2.5 mg daily, even with severely impaired kidney function. However, sustained-release formulations are contraindicated in those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 30 mL/min.  Always consult a doctor for guidance.
* **Dosage Adjustments for Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver problems.  Use with caution is advised. Sustained-release indapamide is contraindicated in those with severe liver impairment or hepatic encephalopathy.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of indapamide in children haven't been established.  It should not be given to children.

* Respiratory: Runny nose (rhinitis).

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in <5% of patients):**

* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea.
* Dermatologic: Itching, rash.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, immediately contact your doctor.

### How it Works

Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic.  It works in the kidneys by increasing the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water.  This reduces the amount of fluid in the bloodstream, lowering blood pressure.  This mechanism also contributes to reducing swelling in patients with congestive heart failure.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Indapamide is contraindicated in individuals with an allergy to indapamide, sulfonamides, severe renal failure (especially with sustained-release formulations), hepatic encephalopathy, severe hepatic impairment (especially with sustained-release formulations), anuria (no urine production), and hypokalemia (low potassium levels).
* **Drug Interactions:** Indapamide can interact with many other medications, including other antihypertensive drugs, NSAIDs, potassium-depleting drugs, lithium, and some antiarrhythmic drugs. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Indapamide can cause electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium, magnesium, high calcium), photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), and may worsen gout.  It should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, high cholesterol, impaired renal or hepatic function, and those prone to gout.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Indapamide is categorized as pregnancy category B.  However, use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's not known if it's excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding should generally be avoided.
* **Elderly:** Elderly patients are more susceptible to side effects and may require lower doses.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take indapamide with alcohol?** A:  No, alcohol can worsen the blood pressure-lowering effect of indapamide, increasing the risk of dizziness and falls. Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **Q: How should I store indapamide?** A: Store indapamide at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking indapamide suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping indapamide abruptly can cause a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication.  Your doctor will gradually reduce your dose to minimize any potential risks.
* **Q:  Is it safe to drive while taking Indapamide?** A: While indapamide may cause dizziness or fatigue, this varies from person to person.  If you experience any such side effects, avoid driving or operating machinery.
