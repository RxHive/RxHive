# Insulin Degludec

**Generic Name:** Degludec

**Usage:** Degludec is a long-acting insulin analog used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes and adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's typically administered once daily, at the same time each day, subcutaneously (under the skin). The specific dosage is determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and blood glucose monitoring.

**Side Effects:**  Like all insulins, degludec can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Injection site reactions:**  Redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is a serious side effect and can cause symptoms like shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness.
* **Weight gain:**  Insulin can cause fluid retention and weight gain.
* **Lipohypertrophy (fat buildup):** This can occur at the injection site with repeated injections in the same area.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but can range from mild skin reactions to severe allergic responses.
* **Edema (swelling):**  Fluid retention can lead to swelling in the extremities.
* **Nausea:** Although less common with degludec compared to some other insulins.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list of side effects. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:** Degludec is a long-acting insulin analog.  This means it's a modified form of human insulin designed to provide a slow and prolonged release of insulin into the bloodstream.  Unlike rapid-acting insulins that work quickly to lower blood sugar after meals, degludec works to provide a constant background level of insulin throughout the day and night.  This helps to prevent high blood sugar levels between meals and overnight. It achieves this prolonged action through its unique self-associating properties which form multi-hexamers, leading to a slow absorption rate from the injection site.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does Degludec last?** Degludec provides a long-acting effect lasting up to 42 hours, allowing for once-daily administration.

* **Can I mix Degludec with other insulins?**  It is generally not recommended to mix degludec with other insulins in the same syringe.  Consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on appropriate insulin regimens.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.  Consult your healthcare provider for guidance.

* **What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?**  Treat low blood sugar immediately with a fast-acting carbohydrate source like glucose tablets or juice.  Monitor your blood sugar levels closely.

* **How should I store Degludec?** Degludec should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.  Once opened, it may be kept at room temperature for a specific period (check product labeling).
