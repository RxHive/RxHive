# Insulin Degludec
### Generic Name
Insulin Degludec

### Usage
Insulin degludec is an ultra-long-acting insulin analog used to manage blood sugar levels in adults and children (1 year and older) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.  Its primary function is to control blood glucose levels by mimicking the action of natural insulin.  It's crucial to understand that insulin degludec is *not* recommended for treating diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes).

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following information is for general knowledge and should not replace the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on many factors including the patient's age, weight, overall health, and response to treatment.  A doctor will determine the appropriate starting dose and subsequent adjustments.


**Adults (Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes):**

* **Insulin-naive patients (never received insulin before):**  The initial total daily dose is generally calculated based on body weight (0.2-0.4 units/kg). This dose is then split; a portion is given as insulin degludec once daily, while the remaining is administered as a short-acting insulin, divided among meals. Dosage adjustments are made gradually over several days based on blood sugar monitoring.

* **Patients already on insulin:** Insulin degludec is typically started at the same daily dose as the patient's current long- or intermediate-acting insulin.  This dose may need adjustments depending on the individual's response.

* **Administration:** Insulin degludec is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the thigh, upper arm, or abdomen. Injection sites should be rotated to prevent lipodystrophy (changes in fat tissue).

**Children (1 year and older, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes):**

* **Insulin-naive patients:** Dosage is similar to adults, with the total daily dose calculated based on body weight and adjusted gradually.

* **Patients already on insulin:**  Insulin degludec is often initiated at 80% of the previous long- or intermediate-acting insulin dose to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.

* **Administration:**  Subcutaneous injection, with rotation of injection sites.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary based on blood glucose monitoring and may be influenced by factors like illness, increased physical activity, changes in diet, or renal/hepatic function.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) - this is a serious side effect and requires immediate attention.
* Antibody development (immune response to the medication).

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Peripheral edema (swelling in extremities)
* Injection site reactions (redness, pain, swelling)
* Lipodystrophy (changes in fat tissue at the injection site)
* Severe allergic reactions (rare but potentially life-threatening)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood).

If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works

Insulin degludec is an insulin analog designed for prolonged action.  After subcutaneous injection, it forms a depot under the skin, releasing insulin slowly into the bloodstream over a 42-hour period. This prolonged action helps maintain consistent blood glucose control.  The insulin then works by binding to insulin receptors on cells, allowing glucose to enter the cells and be used for energy.  This lowers blood glucose levels.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Insulin degludec is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to insulin degludec or any of its components.  It should also not be used during episodes of acute hypoglycemia.

* **Drug Interactions:** Insulin degludec can interact with many medications, including some antibiotics, beta-blockers, corticosteroids, and others.  These interactions can either increase or decrease the effectiveness of insulin degludec, so it's vital to inform your doctor of all medications you're taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, elderly individuals, and those with kidney or liver disease require careful monitoring while using insulin degludec.  The dosage may need adjustment.

* **Hypoglycemia Risk:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is a significant risk with insulin therapy, including insulin degludec.  Patients should be aware of the symptoms (e.g., dizziness, sweating, confusion) and have a plan to manage these episodes.

* **Injection Site Reactions:**  Rotating injection sites and using proper injection technique can reduce the risk of injection site reactions.

* **Alcohol:** Alcohol intake can interfere with blood sugar control. Patients should discuss alcohol consumption with their doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take insulin degludec with food?** A: Yes, insulin degludec can be taken with or without food, but maintaining a consistent eating pattern is important for optimal blood sugar control.

* **Q: How should I store insulin degludec?** A: Store unopened vials in the refrigerator (36-46°F or 2-8°C).  Once opened, it can be stored at room temperature (below 86°F or 30°C) for up to 42 days. Protect from light and do not freeze.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor for guidance.  The advice will vary depending on the type of diabetes and the patient’s health status.

* **Q: Can I mix insulin degludec with other insulins?** A: No, do not mix insulin degludec with other insulin products.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention. This is a serious and potentially life-threatening event.
