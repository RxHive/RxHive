# Isoniazid + Ethambutol

**Generic Name:** Isoniazid/Ethambutol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat tuberculosis (TB) infection.  It's typically used in conjunction with other anti-TB drugs as part of a multi-drug regimen, rather than as a standalone treatment. The specific duration of treatment will depend on the individual's condition and response to therapy, often lasting several months.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed regimen carefully and complete the entire course of treatment, even if symptoms improve, to prevent the development of drug-resistant TB.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Some common side effects include:

* **Isoniazid:**  Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dizziness, tingling or numbness in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy), liver damage (hepatitis), allergic reactions (rash, fever).  In rare cases, more serious side effects can occur.

* **Ethambutol:**  Visual disturbances (blurred vision, changes in color perception), skin rashes, joint pain, and rarely, optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve).


**How it Works:**

* **Isoniazid:**  This is a bactericidal drug, meaning it kills actively growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. It interferes with the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the bacterial cell wall.

* **Ethambutol:** This is a bacteriostatic drug, meaning it inhibits the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. It interferes with the synthesis of arabinogalactan, another crucial component of the bacterial cell wall.

By combining these two drugs with different mechanisms of action, the treatment is more effective at preventing the development of drug-resistant TB strains.
