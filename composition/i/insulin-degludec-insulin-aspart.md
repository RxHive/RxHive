# Insulin Degludec + Insulin Aspart
### Generic Name
Insulin Degludec + Insulin Aspart (This is often sold under brand names like Ryzodeg)


### Usage

Insulin Degludec + Insulin Aspart is a combination medication used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.  It's a "dual-basal-bolus" regimen, meaning it combines two types of insulin to manage blood sugar levels throughout the day.  

* **Insulin Degludec:** This is a long-acting insulin analog.  It provides a steady, basal level of insulin to cover your body's needs between meals and overnight, helping prevent high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Its extended duration of action minimizes the risk of overnight hypoglycemia.

* **Insulin Aspart:** This is a rapid-acting insulin analog.  It's designed to quickly lower blood sugar levels after meals, preventing blood sugar spikes after eating. It works quickly and effectively.


This combination therapy aims to mimic the body's natural insulin production, providing both basal (background) and bolus (mealtime) insulin coverage.  It is not suitable for treating diabetic ketoacidosis or other acute situations that need immediate, intensive insulin therapy.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on your blood sugar levels, dietary habits, physical activity, and overall health.  There's no universally applicable dosage.  It is crucial to follow your doctor's specific instructions.


**Administration:**  Insulin Degludec + Insulin Aspart is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection using a pre-filled pen.  

* **Initial Dose:** Your doctor will likely start you on a low dose and gradually adjust it based on your response.

* **Typical Dosage:** The dose is usually split, with the amount of insulin degludec determined by your basal insulin needs (the insulin required to maintain blood sugar levels between meals), and the amount of insulin aspart adjusted based on your carbohydrate intake at meals.

* **Children and Adolescents:** The use of this medication in children and adolescents requires careful monitoring and dose adjustment by a specialist, as individual needs can vary significantly.  

* **Oral Dosage:** This medication is not available in oral form. It must be injected.


**Important Note:**  Never adjust your dosage without first consulting your doctor or other healthcare professional.  Improper dosage can lead to serious health complications, including hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar): Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and hunger.  Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
* Injection site reactions:  These may include redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* Weight gain:  Insulin therapy can lead to weight gain in some individuals.
* Allergic reactions:  These are rare but can range from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis.


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):  Symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, increased hunger, and fatigue.
* Lipohypertrophy (thickening of the fat tissue under the skin):  This can occur at the injection site.
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Edema (fluid retention)


**If you experience any side effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, consult your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Insulin Degludec + Insulin Aspart works by mimicking the action of natural insulin in the body. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) move from the bloodstream into cells, where it's used for energy.

* **Insulin Degludec:** This long-acting insulin provides a continuous supply of insulin, preventing high blood sugar between meals and overnight. It forms multihexamers, which are slowly absorbed and provide a prolonged duration of action.

* **Insulin Aspart:** This rapid-acting insulin is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, lowering blood sugar levels after meals. It's structurally similar to human insulin but acts faster.


By combining the actions of these two types of insulin, the medication helps maintain blood sugar levels within a healthy range.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not use this medication if you are allergic to insulin or any of its components.
* **Other Medications:** This medication can interact with other drugs, including some oral medications and other types of insulin.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully managed under the guidance of a healthcare professional, adjusting dosage as needed.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Hypoglycemia can impair judgment and coordination, so exercise caution when driving or operating machinery.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Alcohol can affect blood sugar levels and may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.  Moderate your alcohol consumption.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Dosage may need adjustment for those with kidney or liver impairment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How do I store Insulin Degludec + Insulin Aspart?**  A: Store it in the refrigerator, but do not freeze.  Once opened, the pre-filled pen can be stored at room temperature for up to 28 days.

* **Q: Can I mix this insulin with other insulins?** A: No, do not mix this combination insulin with other insulins or medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or diabetes educator for guidance on managing missed doses.  Never try to "catch up" by taking a double dose.

* **Q: What are the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?** A: Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, hunger, and rapid heartbeat.  Treat low blood sugar by consuming fast-acting carbohydrates, such as glucose tablets or juice.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Allergic reactions to insulin can be serious.

* **Q: How often should I check my blood sugar?** A: Your doctor will advise you on the frequency of blood sugar monitoring.  This may vary depending on your individual needs and treatment plan.  This is vital for managing your diabetes effectively.
