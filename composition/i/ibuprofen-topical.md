# Ibuprofen (Topical)
### Generic Name
Ibuprofen (Topical)

### Usage
Ibuprofen topical is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation. Its primary use is for the temporary relief of pain and inflammation associated with:

*   Backache
*   Rheumatic pain
*   Muscular pain
*   Soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains, sports injuries)


### Dosage
**Adults and Children over 12 years:**

*   Apply 50-125 mg (4-10 cm of 5% gel or 2-5 cm of 10% gel) to the affected area up to four times daily.
*   Ensure at least four hours between applications.
*   The maximum daily dose is 500 mg.

**Children under 12 years:**  Use in children under 12 years is not typically recommended without explicit guidance from a healthcare provider.  The safety and efficacy in this age group haven't been established for topical ibuprofen.

**Dosage Forms:**  Ibuprofen topical is available as a gel.

**Administration:** Apply the gel to the affected area and rub it in gently until fully absorbed.  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Wash your hands after each application.  Do not use occlusive dressings.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these side effects isn't specifically defined but is generally considered low with topical application.  

*   Application site reactions (irritation, redness, itching)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** These are rare but require immediate medical attention.

*   Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
*   Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin shedding)
*   Anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe blistering and skin peeling)

**Note:** If you experience any adverse reactions, especially severe ones, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Ibuprofen topical works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemical messengers in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation. By reducing prostaglandin levels at the application site, it helps alleviate pain and reduce swelling.
