# Ibalizumab
### Generic Name
Ibalizumab

### Usage
Ibalizumab is a prescription medication used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infection in adults.  Specifically, it's indicated for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection. This means it's used when other HIV medications have stopped working due to the virus developing resistance.  Ibalizumab is *not* recommended for patients who have never received antiretroviral therapy (ART).  It works by a different mechanism than many other HIV drugs, making it a valuable option in situations where resistance has developed.

### Dosage
Ibalizumab is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage is as follows:

* **Loading Dose:** 2 grams (g) given as a single dose.
* **Maintenance Dose:** 800 mg every 14 days.

If a maintenance dose is missed by more than 3 days, a repeat loading dose (2 g) should be administered before resuming the regular maintenance schedule.  The medication is given as an infusion, not a rapid injection.  The loading dose should be administered over at least 30 minutes, while maintenance doses can be given over at least 15 minutes after the initial loading dose. The manufacturer's instructions should be followed meticulously regarding preparation and administration.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not established.  Pediatric use has not been established and is not recommended.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Increased blood glucose levels
* Increased uric acid levels
* Diarrhea
* Increased serum lipase levels
* Decreased hemoglobin levels
* Decreased neutrophil count (a type of white blood cell)
* Decreased platelet count
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased direct and total serum bilirubin levels
* Increased serum creatinine levels


Less common side effects (less than 1%):

* Antibody development
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)


Post-marketing surveillance has identified:

* Pruritus (itching)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Infusion-related reactions

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ibalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts as a post-attachment inhibitor of HIV-1. This means it doesn't prevent the virus from attaching to cells, but instead blocks the virus from entering CD4+ T-cells (a type of white blood cell that HIV infects). It achieves this by binding to a specific part of the CD4 receptor on these cells, causing a conformational change that prevents the virus from fusing with and infecting the cell.  This unique mechanism of action makes it effective even against HIV strains resistant to other drugs.

### Precautions
Ibalizumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a known hypersensitivity to ibalizumab or any component of the formulation. There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare providers as the safety of ibalizumab in these populations is not established. Breastfeeding is generally not recommended for women with HIV due to the risk of transmission.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ibalizumab with other medications?** A: Ibalizumab is used *in combination* with other antiretroviral medications.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate combination based on your individual circumstances.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.

* **Q: How is Ibalizumab stored?** A:  Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for storage instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a maintenance dose by more than 3 days, contact your doctor immediately for guidance. A loading dose will likely be required.

* **Q: Is Ibalizumab right for everyone with HIV?** A: No, Ibalizumab is specifically for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection. It's not suitable for everyone with HIV and is not used as a first-line treatment.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Ibalizumab?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential.
