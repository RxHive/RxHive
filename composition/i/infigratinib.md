# Infigratinib
### Generic Name
Infigratinib

### Usage
Infigratinib is a targeted cancer medication specifically designed for adults diagnosed with previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.  This is a type of liver cancer.  Crucially, its use is restricted to patients whose cancer has a specific genetic characteristic: a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement.  This rearrangement must be confirmed by an FDA-approved test before treatment with Infigratinib can begin.  Infigratinib works by targeting and inhibiting the FGFR2 protein, thereby hindering the cancer's growth and spread. There are currently no approved uses for Infigratinib outside of this specific type of cholangiocarcinoma.


### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for cholangiocarcinoma is 125 mg orally once daily (OD) for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day break. This 28-day cycle is repeated until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  The 125mg dose is usually administered as one 100mg capsule and one 25mg capsule.

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Patients with mild hepatic impairment receive 100mg OD; those with moderate impairment receive 75mg OD.  Dosage adjustments for severe hepatic impairment or renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling and should be determined under close medical supervision.  Dose reductions may also be necessary based on the severity of side effects. For example, Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) may require dose interruption or reduction depending on severity and response to treatment.  Similarly, hyperphosphatemia management may necessitate dose adjustments or temporary cessation of treatment.


The safety and effectiveness of Infigratinib in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Edema (swelling)
*   Epistaxis (nosebleeds)
*   Abnormal eyelash growth
*   Blurred vision
*   Cataracts
*   Dry eye syndrome
*   Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) â€“ a serious side effect requiring ophthalmologic monitoring
*   Abdominal pain
*   Constipation
*   Decreased appetite
*   Diarrhea
*   Altered taste (dysgeusia)
*   Indigestion (dyspepsia)
*   Increased serum lipase levels
*   Nausea
*   Mouth sores (stomatitis)
*   Vomiting
*   Dry mouth (xerostomia)
*   Decreased neutrophil count
*   Decreased platelet count
*   Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)

*   Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)
*   Increased cholesterol and triglycerides
*   Weight loss
*   Joint pain (arthralgia)
*   Limb pain
*   Increased serum creatinine levels
*   Fever

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:  Anemia, decreased serum calcium, hypercalcemia, bone fractures, infections (including sepsis), vascular calcification, cutaneous calcification, retinopathy.


If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Infigratinib is a kinase inhibitor that selectively targets fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), particularly FGFR2.  Cancer cells often rely on abnormal FGFR signaling for growth and survival.  By blocking this signaling pathway, Infigratinib inhibits the proliferation and survival of cancer cells that have FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, thus slowing or stopping tumor growth.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer. However, careful consideration is needed for certain patient populations.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Infigratinib's metabolism can be affected by other medications.  Avoid concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. The coadministration of gastric acid-reducing agents (PPIs, H2-antagonists, and locally acting antacids) may decrease Infigratinib plasma concentrations.  If coadministration cannot be avoided, it should be done with a time separation to minimize interactions.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Infigratinib may cause fetal harm and should not be used during pregnancy.  Effective contraception is essential for both men and women during treatment and for one month after the final dose.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for one month afterward.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and mild renal impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for severe impairment.
*   **Ocular Toxicity:**  Regular ophthalmological examinations are crucial due to the risk of retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) and other ocular toxicities.
*   **Hyperphosphatemia and Soft Tissue Mineralization:** Close monitoring of serum phosphate levels is critical to manage hyperphosphatemia and potential soft tissue mineralization.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Infigratinib with food?** A: No, take Infigratinib on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose by more than 4 hours, or if you vomit after taking it, resume your regular schedule the next day.

*   **Q: How should I store Infigratinib?** A: Store Infigratinib as directed on the product label.

*   **Q: Is Infigratinib safe for everyone?** A: No, Infigratinib is only indicated for specific types of cholangiocarcinoma and requires careful monitoring due to potential side effects. It is not approved for use in children.

*   **Q: What are the long-term effects of Infigratinib?** A: The long-term effects are still being studied, but close medical supervision is necessary to manage potential side effects and monitor treatment response.
