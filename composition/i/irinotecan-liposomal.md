# Irinotecan (Liposomal)
### Generic Name
Irinotecan (Liposomal)

### Usage
Irinotecan (liposomal) is primarily used in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin to treat metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  This treatment is specifically indicated for patients whose pancreatic cancer has progressed after initial treatment with gemcitabine-based therapy.  It's crucial to understand that irinotecan liposomal and conventional irinotecan are *not* interchangeable; their dosages differ significantly.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** Irinotecan (liposomal) and conventional irinotecan are not interchangeable.  Always verify the intended product and dosage before preparation and administration.

**Adults (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma):**  The usual intravenous (IV) dose is 70 mg/m² administered once every two weeks in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin.  However, for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (a genetic variation affecting drug metabolism), the starting dose should be reduced to 50 mg/m².  The dose may be increased to 70 mg/m² in subsequent cycles depending on the patient's tolerance.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of liposomal irinotecan have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are not specifically detailed in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment. However, extreme caution should be exercised when using this medication in patients with elevated serum bilirubin levels or creatinine clearance less than 89 ml/min.  Detailed adjustments based on toxicity are described below under "Dosage Adjustments."

**Toxicity Management (Dosage Reduction/Treatment Interruption):**
Dosage adjustments are crucial based on the severity of side effects. The following adjustments should be considered:

* **Hematologic Toxicity (low white blood cell count):** If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) drops below 1500/mm³ or if neutropenic fever develops, treatment should be withheld. Treatment can resume when the ANC is ≥1500/mm³. For grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever, the dose should be reduced in subsequent cycles. Specific dose reductions are detailed in the original data.

* **Anaphylactic Reaction:**  Irinotecan (liposomal) should be permanently discontinued.

* **Diarrhea:** Withhold treatment for grade 2-4 diarrhea.  Administer intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (0.25–1 mg, unless contraindicated) for early-onset diarrhea of any severity. Loperamide should be used for late-onset diarrhea of any severity. Once diarrhea improves to grade ≤1, treatment may resume at a reduced dose. Specific dose reductions are detailed in the original data.

* **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD):** Irinotecan (liposomal) should be permanently discontinued.

* **Other Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Reactions:** Withhold treatment. Once the adverse reaction recovers to grade ≤1, treatment may resume at a reduced dose. Specific dose reductions are detailed in the original data.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include: fatigue, alopecia (hair loss), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, mouth sores, anemia, low white blood cell count (neutropenia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), increased liver enzyme levels, and various electrolyte imbalances.  

Serious, but less common side effects include: septic shock, severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), severe infections (sepsis, neutropenic sepsis), pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, acute renal failure, and dehydration.

**It is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.**


### How it Works
Irinotecan (liposomal) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.  The irinotecan is encapsulated within a liposome (a small fat-based vesicle).  Irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, work by binding to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex, preventing the re-ligation of cleaved DNA strands. This leads to an accumulation of DNA breaks, ultimately causing cell death, primarily affecting cells actively replicating their DNA (S-phase cells).


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Irinotecan (liposomal) is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, and in breastfeeding women (per Canadian labeling).

**Warnings:** Irinotecan (liposomal) carries a significant risk of bone marrow suppression (potentially fatal neutropenic sepsis), severe gastrointestinal toxicity (severe diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis), and pulmonary toxicity (potentially fatal interstitial lung disease). Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are also possible.

**Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using this medication in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with other chemotherapeutic agents or live vaccines may increase the risk of infection.  Concomitant use with ketoconazole, itraconazole, or atazanavir may increase irinotecan levels.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Irinotecan (liposomal) can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for one month afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for one month after the last dose.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Irinotecan (liposomal) administered?**  A: It is administered intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes. Premedication with a corticosteroid and an antiemetic is typically recommended.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe diarrhea?** A: Contact your doctor immediately. Severe diarrhea is a serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.  Do not self-treat.

* **Q: How should I store Irinotecan (liposomal)?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

* **Q: Is Irinotecan (liposomal) the same as conventional irinotecan?** A: No, they are not interchangeable and have different dosing regimens.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of Irinotecan (liposomal)?** A: Long-term effects can vary significantly based on individual response and overall health. Regular follow-up appointments with your oncologist are essential to monitor for any long-term side effects.
