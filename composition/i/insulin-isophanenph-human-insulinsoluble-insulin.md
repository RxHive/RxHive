# Insulin Isophane/NPH + Human Insulin/Soluble Insulin
### Generic Name
Insulin Isophane/NPH + Human Insulin/Soluble Insulin (also known as  NPH/Regular Insulin Mix)


### Usage
This combination medication contains two types of insulin: NPH (Isophane insulin) and regular (soluble) human insulin.  It's used to control high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes mellitus.  

* **Primary Use:**  Management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This combination is particularly useful because it provides both a rapid-acting (regular insulin) and an intermediate-acting (NPH insulin) effect. This helps mimic the body's natural insulin release, controlling blood sugar levels throughout the day and night.

* **Secondary Uses:**  While primarily for diabetes management, the precise ratio of regular to NPH insulin within a specific product can influence its use in certain situations, as determined by a physician. For example, some formulations might be preferred for specific blood sugar patterns.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's blood sugar levels, diet, activity level, and overall health.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose.  This information is for general understanding and should not be used to self-prescribe. **Never adjust your insulin dosage without consulting your doctor or diabetes educator.**

* **Adults:**  The starting dose and subsequent adjustments are determined through blood glucose monitoring and medical assessment.  Doses are usually administered via subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  The specific dose and frequency will vary depending on the formulation (e.g., 70/30 mix, meaning 70% NPH and 30% regular insulin).

* **Children:**  Dosage in children is also individualized based on age, weight, and blood glucose levels.  Pediatric endocrinologists will carefully manage the dosage.  Subcutaneous injection is the typical method.

* **Oral Administration:** This medication is not available in oral form. It must be injected.

* **Intravenous Administration (IV):**  While regular human insulin can be given intravenously, the NPH/regular insulin mix is not suitable for IV administration.  It's specifically formulated for subcutaneous injection.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching), weight gain.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe hypoglycemia, lipohypertrophy (thickening of the subcutaneous fat at the injection site), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing).  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

This combination insulin works by mimicking the body's natural insulin production.

* **Regular Insulin:**  This rapid-acting insulin quickly lowers blood glucose by facilitating the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into cells.

* **NPH Insulin:** This intermediate-acting insulin provides a longer-lasting effect, controlling blood sugar levels for several hours after injection.

Together, these two types of insulin provide a more consistent and controlled blood glucose level throughout the day, preventing both high (hyperglycemia) and low (hypoglycemia) blood sugar episodes.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hypersensitivity to insulin.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Several medications can interact with insulin, impacting its effectiveness or increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.  These include some oral medications, such as corticosteroids and beta-blockers.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings for Specific Groups:**

    * **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** Insulin needs often change during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Careful monitoring and dose adjustments are essential.

    * **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to hypoglycemia.  Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary.

    * **Children:**  Dosage requires careful calculation and adjustment based on the child's weight and metabolic needs.


### FAQs

* **Q: How do I store my insulin?**  A:  Store unopened insulin in the refrigerator.  Once opened, store it at room temperature, away from direct heat and light.  Discard insulin after the expiration date.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double your dose to make up for a missed dose. Contact your doctor or diabetes educator for guidance.

* **Q: What are the symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?**  A: Symptoms can include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  If you suspect hypoglycemia, consume a fast-acting carbohydrate source like glucose tablets or juice.

* **Q: Can I switch insulin types on my own?** A: Absolutely not.  Changing insulin types or dosages must be done under the supervision of your doctor or diabetes healthcare team.  Never self-adjust your insulin regimen.

* **Q:  How often do I need to check my blood sugar?** A: Your doctor or diabetes educator will advise you on the frequency of blood glucose monitoring, but it's typically several times a day.
