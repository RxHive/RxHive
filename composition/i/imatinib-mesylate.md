# Imatinib mesylate
### Generic Name
Imatinib mesylate

### Usage
Imatinib mesylate is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat certain types of cancer.  Its main application is in the management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a cancer of the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.  It's highly effective at targeting the abnormal BCR-ABL protein responsible for the uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells.  Beyond CML, imatinib also plays a role in treating other cancers, including certain types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that carry the Philadelphia chromosome (a genetic abnormality involving the BCR-ABL fusion gene),  gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and some rarer cancers.  The specific dosage and treatment approach will depend greatly on the type and stage of cancer.


### Dosage
Dosage of imatinib mesylate varies significantly based on the specific cancer being treated, the patient's weight and overall health, and the response to therapy.  It's crucial to follow the physician's prescribed dosage meticulously.  

* **Oral:** Imatinib is typically administered orally as a tablet. Common adult dosages range from 400mg to 800mg daily, but this is heavily dependent on the type of cancer. Children’s dosages are determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician based on body surface area (BSA) and other factors.

* **IV (Intravenous):**  Imatinib is not typically administered intravenously. The oral form is the standard route of administration.

Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on side effects or the patient’s response to treatment. It's crucial to note that this information is for general understanding and does not substitute for personalized guidance from a healthcare professional.  A physician will carefully determine the optimal dosage for each patient.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of imatinib mesylate can include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps or aches
* Swelling (edema)
* Fatigue
* Rash
* Headache
* Fluid retention

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity) – indicated by abnormal liver function tests.
* Heart problems (cardiotoxicity) – such as fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) or heart failure.
* Lung problems (interstitial lung disease) - shortness of breath and coughing are possible symptoms
* Severe allergic reactions


If any significant or concerning side effects occur, immediate medical attention should be sought.


### How it Works
Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that play a critical role in cell signaling and growth. The BCR-ABL protein, found in CML and certain other cancers, is a particularly active tyrosine kinase. Imatinib works by selectively binding to and inhibiting the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, thus blocking the signals that promote the uncontrolled growth and survival of cancer cells. By interrupting this process, imatinib helps to slow or stop the progression of the cancer.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Imatinib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to imatinib or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** Imatinib can interact with other medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken before starting imatinib therapy.  Some interactions are known to be particularly significant.  

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Imatinib is categorized as a pregnancy category D drug. This means it poses a risk to a developing fetus and should generally be avoided during pregnancy. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception while taking imatinib.  It is not recommended to breastfeed while using imatinib due to the potential for the drug to pass into breast milk.

* **Older Adults and Children:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed for older adults and children, based on their overall health and the specific cancer being treated.  Close monitoring is usually recommended in these populations.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long do I need to take imatinib?** A: The duration of imatinib therapy varies greatly depending on the type of cancer, response to treatment, and individual circumstances.  Treatment can range from several months to many years.  Your oncologist will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: Can I stop taking imatinib if I feel better?** A: No.  Stopping imatinib prematurely can lead to the cancer returning.  Even if you feel well, it's crucial to continue taking the medication as prescribed by your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store imatinib?** A: Store imatinib at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Are there any long-term side effects?** A: While many side effects are manageable, long-term use of imatinib can potentially lead to various side effects, some of which are serious. Regular check-ups and monitoring are essential to detect and manage potential issues.  Your physician will closely monitor for any signs of long-term issues.
