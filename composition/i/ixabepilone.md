# Ixabepilone
### Generic Name
Ixabepilone

### Usage
Ixabepilone is a chemotherapy medication used to treat certain types of breast cancer.  Its primary use is in combination with capecitabine for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer that has not responded well to anthracyclines (a type of chemotherapy) and taxanes (another type of chemotherapy), or in cases where further anthracycline therapy is not advisable.  It's also used as a single agent (on its own) to treat metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer that is resistant or unresponsive to anthracyclines, taxanes, and capecitabine.  In essence, it's a treatment option for breast cancers that haven't responded to other common chemotherapy regimens.


### Dosage
Ixabepilone is administered intravenously (IV).  The standard adult dose is 40 mg/m² given once every three weeks. This dosage applies whether it is used alone or in combination with capecitabine.  The maximum dose is 88 mg.  Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or until side effects become intolerable.  Body surface area (BSA) is capped at 2.2 m² for dose calculations.

**Important Premedication:** Before each infusion, patients are typically premedicated with an antihistamine (like diphenhydramine) and an H2-blocker (like ranitidine) about an hour beforehand to help reduce allergic reactions.  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions may also receive corticosteroids (like dexamethasone) for further precaution.

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are made based on liver function tests (AST, ALT, and bilirubin). If liver function is significantly impaired, the dose may be reduced or the medication may be contraindicated, particularly when used in combination with capecitabine.
* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dose adjustments for kidney problems, but close monitoring is crucial.
* **Hematologic Toxicity (low blood cell counts):**  If there are significant drops in neutrophil or platelet counts, the dose will be reduced.
* **Non-Hematologic Toxicity:**  Dose reduction or discontinuation depends on the severity and duration of other side effects, such as neuropathy.  Refer to the dosage adjustments section of the complete prescribing information.
* **Obesity:**  Current guidelines suggest using actual body weight for dose calculations, especially when aiming for a curative effect. Toxicity management is similar to non-obese patients.


Pediatric dosages have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include fatigue, weakness, nerve damage (neuropathy), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), hair loss, nausea, mouth sores (stomatitis), vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia), inflammation of mucous membranes, loss of appetite (anorexia), constipation, abdominal pain, altered taste (dysgeusia), and mucositis.

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include nail changes, hand-foot syndrome, low red blood cell count (anemia), dizziness, shortness of breath (dyspnea), swelling (edema), gastroesophageal reflux disease, and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).  Cardiac issues (left ventricular dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and arrhythmias) and hypersensitivity reactions are also possible.

**If you experience any side effects, particularly severe ones, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
Ixabepilone is an epothilone B analog.  It works by binding to beta-tubulin, a protein that's a key component of microtubules. Microtubules are essential parts of cells, involved in cell division and other cellular processes. By binding to beta-tubulin, ixabepilone promotes the assembly of microtubules and stabilizes their structure. This prevents the microtubules from functioning normally, ultimately disrupting cell division and leading to cell death (apoptosis), particularly in rapidly dividing cancer cells.


### Precautions
Ixabepilone is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to polyoxyethylated castor oil or its derivatives,  a low white blood cell count (neutrophil count <1500/mm³), a low platelet count (platelet count <100000/mm³), or when used with capecitabine in patients with impaired liver function (AST or ALT >2.5 times ULN or bilirubin >1 times ULN).

Use caution in elderly patients, patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, impaired liver function (AST or ALT >5 times ULN), pre-existing peripheral neuropathy or diabetes, and patients performing tasks requiring mental alertness.

There is an increased risk of bone marrow suppression, cognitive impairment, hypersensitivity reactions, and peripheral neuropathy.  Because it is a Category D drug during pregnancy, it can harm the developing fetus and should only be considered with careful risk-benefit assessment. It is not recommended during breastfeeding.  It's also important to be aware of potential drug interactions,  including those with certain antifungals, antivirals, antibiotics, and other medications that can impact metabolism or clearance of ixabepilone.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are taking.



### FAQs

* **Q: How is ixabepilone stored?** A:  Refer to the medication packaging for specific storage instructions. It usually requires refrigeration.
* **Q: Can I drive after taking ixabepilone?** A:  Because of potential side effects like dizziness and fatigue, caution is advised while driving or operating machinery.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately for guidance.  Do not attempt to make up a missed dose on your own.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking ixabepilone?** A:  Alcohol may exacerbate some side effects.  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **Q:  Are there long-term effects of ixabepilone?** A:  Long-term effects vary and depend on individual factors.  Your healthcare provider can provide more information and monitor you closely.  Some long-term issues might include lingering neuropathy.
