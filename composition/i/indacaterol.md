# Indacaterol

**Generic Name:** Indacaterol

**Usage:**

Indacaterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) used to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's also sometimes used for bronchospasm associated with other lung diseases.  It is *not* used for treating acute symptoms; it's for long-term maintenance.  It's usually inhaled using a dry powder inhaler.  It's often prescribed in combination with other COPD medications like corticosteroids or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs).

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infection (e.g., sore throat, common cold)
* Dizziness
* Tremor (shaking)
* Nausea
* Muscle cramps
* Throat irritation (from inhalation)
* Sinusitis


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
* Increased blood pressure
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties) â€“ this is rare but serious.
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


**How it Works:**

Indacaterol works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs. This makes it easier to breathe by widening the airways.  It does this by selectively binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, triggering a cascade of events that ultimately lead to smooth muscle relaxation.  Its long-acting nature means that a single dose provides sustained relief for up to 24 hours.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Indacaterol a steroid?** No, Indacaterol is not a steroid. It's a LABA, a different class of medication.
* **Can I use Indacaterol for asthma?** While sometimes used off-label, it's not typically the first-line treatment for asthma.  It's primarily for COPD.
* **Can I suddenly stop taking Indacaterol?**  No, you should not suddenly stop taking Indacaterol without talking to your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can worsen your condition.  Your doctor will need to help you gradually reduce your dosage.
* **How long does it take to work?**  While the effect isn't immediate like a rescue inhaler (e.g., albuterol), the bronchodilation from Indacaterol typically becomes noticeable within a few hours of the first dose and provides sustained relief throughout the day.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Indacaterol may interact with other medications, particularly those affecting the heart.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Is Indacaterol safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The safety of Indacaterol during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established.  You should consult your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits.
