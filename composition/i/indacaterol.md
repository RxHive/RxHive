# Indacaterol
### Generic Name
Indacaterol

### Usage
Indacaterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) primarily used for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This includes conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's crucial to understand that indacaterol is *not* indicated for the treatment of asthma.  Using it as monotherapy (without a corticosteroid) in asthma is contraindicated and may increase the risk of asthma-related death.

### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):**  The dosage depends on the formulation and strength of the indacaterol capsule.  It's typically administered once daily via oral inhalation using a specific inhalation device provided by the manufacturer.

* **75 mcg capsule:** The contents of one 75 mcg capsule are inhaled once daily.
* **150 mcg capsule:** Initially, the contents of one 150 mcg capsule are inhaled once daily.  In some patients, increasing the dose to a 300 mcg capsule once daily may provide additional benefit.
* **300 mcg capsule:**  This is the maximum recommended daily dose.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of indacaterol in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  For those with severe hepatic impairment or renal impairment, the manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments; safety and efficacy haven't been established in these groups.

**Administration:**  Indacaterol comes in capsule form; the contents of the capsule are inhaled, not swallowed.  Always follow the instructions provided with the specific inhalation device.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (â‰¥10%):**

* Cough

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the throat)


**Less Frequent but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Dizziness
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Palpitations
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Indacaterol is a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist (LABA). It works by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the lungs. This leads to increased production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), resulting in the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle.  The bronchodilation (widening of the airways) improves airflow and makes breathing easier for individuals with COPD.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to indacaterol or any component of the formulation.
* Use as monotherapy for asthma (without concomitant inhaled corticosteroid).

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of asthma-related death when used as monotherapy in asthma.
* Potential for paradoxical bronchospasm.
* Risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
* Potential for hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

**Use with caution in:**

* Patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetes).
* Patients with hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
* Patients with hypokalemia (low potassium).
* Patients with seizure disorders (epilepsy).


**Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use of indacaterol with umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol or vilanterol/fluticasone furoate should be avoided due to increased toxicity related to increased blood pressure and heart rate.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I use Indacaterol for asthma?**

A: No. Indacaterol is not approved for the treatment of asthma and should not be used as monotherapy for asthma as this can increase the risk of serious complications.  Consult a healthcare provider for appropriate asthma treatment.


**Q: How should I store Indacaterol?**

A: Store indacaterol capsules in a cool, dry place, protected from light and moisture, as directed on the product label.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.


**Q:  Can I use Indacaterol during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?**

A:  Indacaterol is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. The excretion of indacaterol in breast milk is unknown, so use with caution during breastfeeding.  Consult with your healthcare provider.


**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A: If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.
