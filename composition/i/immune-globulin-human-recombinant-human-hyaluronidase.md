# Immune Globulin Human/ Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase
### Generic Name
Immune Globulin Human/Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase

### Usage
Immune Globulin Human/Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase is primarily used to treat Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) in adults.  PI encompasses a range of conditions where the body's immune system is unable to adequately defend against infection. This includes, but is not limited to, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia, congenital agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiencies.  The medication helps to supplement the body's deficient antibody levels, providing passive immunity against various bacterial and viral infections.

### Dosage
Dosage is individualized based on the patient's response and serum IgG trough levels.  It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dosage instructions.

**Adult Dosage (Primary Immunodeficiency):**

* **Initial Dosing:**  The first dose is typically given one week after the patient's last dose of another immunoglobulin product (IVIG).  For patients new to IgG treatment, a titration schedule is followed:
    * Week 1: 25% of the targeted dose (weekly)
    * Week 2: 50% of the targeted dose (every two weeks)
    * Week 4: 75% of the targeted dose (every three weeks)
    * Week 7: 100% of the targeted dose (every four weeks - if required)
* **Maintenance Dosing:** After the titration phase, the goal is to achieve a dosing interval of every 3-4 weeks. The target dose is generally 300-600 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously (SC).  Dosage adjustments are made based on clinical response and serum IgG trough levels.
* **Switching from IVIG:** If switching from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), the initial dose is usually the same as the previous IVIG dose, followed by the titration schedule described above.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment.  However, a healthcare provider might consider using a lower dose more frequently.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** There are no specific dosage adjustments recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with liver impairment.

**Important Note:**  Baseline serum IgG trough levels should be obtained to guide dosage adjustments.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), headache, gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting), fever, sore throat, rash, cough, fatigue, allergic reactions, abdominal pain, and general pain.

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) may include arthralgia (joint pain), migraine, epistaxis (nosebleed), and nausea.

Serious but less common side effects include hypersensitivity reactions, thrombosis (blood clots), aseptic meningitis syndrome, hemolysis (red blood cell breakdown), renal dysfunction or failure, spread of localized infection, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and transmission of infectious agents.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

### How it Works
Immune Globulin Human provides a broad range of antibodies that help neutralize bacteria and viruses.  Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase acts as a spreading agent, enabling more efficient subcutaneous absorption of the immune globulin.  The hyaluronidase temporarily increases the permeability of subcutaneous tissue by breaking down hyaluronan, a component of connective tissue.  This improves the distribution and uptake of the immune globulin into the bloodstream.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or severe systemic reactions to IgG, IgA-deficient patients with IgA antibodies and a history of hypersensitivity to the drug, and those with known hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase.
* **Interactions:** Passive transfer of antibodies may temporarily reduce the effectiveness of live attenuated virus vaccines (such as mumps, rubella, varicella, and measles).
* **Warnings:**  There is a risk of hypersensitivity reactions, thrombosis, aseptic meningitis syndrome, hemolysis, renal dysfunction or failure, spread of localized infection, TRALI, and transmission of infectious agents.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  This medication is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is this medication administered?** A: This medication is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects of this treatment are variable, depending on the individual's condition and response to therapy.  Regular monitoring of IgG levels is essential.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Generally, it is essential to maintain the appropriate temperature range.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider immediately to determine the best course of action.  Do not double the dose.
