# Itolizumab

**Generic Name:** Itolizumab

**Usage:** Itolizumab is a monoclonal antibody used primarily in the treatment of moderate to severe recalcitrant chronic plaque psoriasis in adults who have not responded adequately to other systemic therapies, including ciclosporin, methotrexate, and retinoids.  It has also shown some promise in treating cytokine release syndrome (CRS) associated with CAR T-cell therapy and COVID-19, though its use in these indications is not as widely established or approved in all regions.  It's crucial to note that its use outside of its approved indications is considered off-label and requires careful medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Itolizumab can cause side effects.  Common side effects include:

* **Infections:** Increased susceptibility to infections (upper respiratory tract infections, etc.) is a common concern.
* **Injection site reactions:**  Pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Allergic reactions, ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis, are possible.
* **Infusion-related reactions:** Fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
* **Neurological effects:**  Headache, dizziness, paresthesia (tingling or numbness).
* **Increased risk of opportunistic infections:** In immunocompromised individuals.

Serious side effects are less common but can occur.  Immediate medical attention should be sought if any serious side effects develop.  These can include severe allergic reactions, serious infections, and other significant adverse events.


**How it Works:** Itolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the CD6 receptor, which is expressed on various immune cells, including T lymphocytes. By binding to CD6, Itolizumab inhibits the activation and proliferation of T cells, reducing the inflammatory response that contributes to psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune conditions.  It specifically modulates the activity of T helper cells, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
