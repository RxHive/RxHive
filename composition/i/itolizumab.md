# Itolizumab
### Generic Name
Itolizumab

### Usage
Itolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD6, a protein found on the surface of T-cells.  Its primary use is in the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.  This means it's used when other treatments haven't been effective.  Importantly, it also has a secondary, albeit crucial, application in managing cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients suffering from COVID-19.  This use targets the severe inflammatory response characteristic of severe COVID-19.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Before each Itolizumab infusion, pre-medication with hydrocortisone 100 mg IV (or an equivalent short-acting glucocorticoid) and pheniramine 30 mg IV is typically given approximately 30 ± 10 minutes beforehand.

**Plaque Psoriasis:**

*   **Administration:** Intravenous (IV) infusion.
*   **Dosage:** The recommended regimen is 6 mg/kg once every two weeks for twelve weeks, followed by a reduced dose of 1.6 mg/kg every four weeks for up to twenty-four weeks.  Approximately 50 mL of the diluted Itolizumab solution should be administered during the first hour, followed by the remaining solution in the next hour.

**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in COVID-19 ARDS:**

*   **Administration:** Intravenous (IV) infusion.
*   **Dosage:** An initial dose of 1.6 mg/kg is given over 5-6 hours. The infusion should begin at 25 mL/hour for the first hour; if tolerated well, the rate may be increased to 50 mL/hour to finish the infusion.  If the infusion needs to be interrupted due to a reaction, it must be restarted very slowly under close monitoring.  A second dose of 0.8 mg/kg might be given 3-4 hours later after 7 days, depending on the patient's clinical state and inflammatory marker levels.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Itolizumab in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Itolizumab is not recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

*   Diarrhea
*   Upper respiratory tract infections
*   Pruritus (itching)
*   Infusion-site reactions
*   Pyrexia (fever)


Less common but serious side effects, including hypersensitivity reactions and transient lymphopenia (low lymphocyte count, particularly relevant in COVID-19 patients), can occur.  Any concerning side effects warrant immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Itolizumab works by binding to CD6, a protein on the surface of T-cells. By binding to CD6, it downregulates T-cell activation, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  This dampens the inflammatory response, which is crucial in both psoriasis and CRS associated with COVID-19. The reduction in inflammation helps alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis and controls the potentially life-threatening hyperinflammation in COVID-19.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Itolizumab is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of Itolizumab or murine proteins.
*   **Hypersensitivity:**  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Close monitoring is crucial during and after infusion.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Itolizumab is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to the potential for harm to the fetus or infant. While it's unknown whether it is excreted in breast milk, the potential for adverse reactions in the nursing infant necessitates careful consideration.
*   **Other Medications:**  While specific drug interactions are not extensively documented, always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Itolizumab administered?** A: Itolizumab is administered intravenously (IV) as an infusion.

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time to see results varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response to the medication.

*   **Q: How is Itolizumab stored?** A:  Once diluted, Itolizumab is stable in a normal saline solution for up to 10 hours at room temperature, protected from light. Refrigeration (2-8°C) is also acceptable.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
