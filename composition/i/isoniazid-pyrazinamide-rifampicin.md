# Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide + Rifampicin

**Generic Name:** Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide + Rifampicin (This is often referred to as a fixed-dose combination, or FDC)

**Usage:** This combination is a first-line treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).  It's typically used in conjunction with other anti-TB drugs as part of a multi-drug regimen, usually for the initial intensive phase of treatment. The precise duration and dosage depend on the individual's condition and the guidelines followed by healthcare professionals.  This is *not* a medication to be taken without prescription and supervision from a qualified physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency between individuals and across the constituent drugs.  Common side effects can include:

* **Isoniazid (INH):** Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling in extremities), hepatotoxicity (liver damage), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, rash.  Rarely, seizures or severe allergic reactions.
* **Pyrazinamide (PZA):** Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), arthralgia (joint pain), hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels), nausea, vomiting, rash.
* **Rifampicin (RIF):**  Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), orange-red discoloration of urine, sweat, and tears, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, rash.  Rarely, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells).

**Serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:**  Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), severe abdominal pain, dark urine, unusual bleeding or bruising, severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of face/throat).

**How it Works:**  The three drugs in this combination target different aspects of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria responsible for TB.

* **Isoniazid (INH):** Inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the bacterial cell wall.
* **Pyrazinamide (PZA):**  Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to disrupt bacterial metabolism and is particularly effective against dormant bacteria.
* **Rifampicin (RIF):** Inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis, preventing the bacteria from producing essential proteins.

By using multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action, the combination is more effective in killing the bacteria and reducing the risk of drug resistance.
