# Insulin Aspart + Insulin Aspart Protamine

**Generic Name:** Insulin aspart/insulin aspart protamine (This is often referred to as a "premix" insulin)

**Usage:**  This combination insulin is used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It's a premixed insulin, meaning it contains both fast-acting (insulin aspart) and intermediate-acting (insulin aspart protamine) insulin in a single injection. The fast-acting component starts working quickly to cover the immediate needs for blood sugar control after a meal, while the intermediate-acting component provides longer-lasting blood sugar control.  The exact ratio of fast-acting to intermediate-acting insulin varies depending on the specific brand and formulation (e.g., 70/30, 75/25). This allows for better control of both post-meal and basal glucose levels. It is usually administered before meals.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect. Symptoms can include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, rapid heartbeat, and even loss of consciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:**  These can include redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:**  Insulin can cause weight gain in some people.
* **Lipohypertrophy (fat buildup):**  This can occur at the injection site with repeated injections in the same area.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible; symptoms can range from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis.

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary between individuals.  It's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist for complete information.


**How it Works:** Insulin aspart/insulin aspart protamine works by lowering blood glucose levels.  The fast-acting insulin aspart component rapidly binds to insulin receptors on cells, allowing glucose to move from the bloodstream into the cells for use as energy. The intermediate-acting insulin aspart protamine component is released more slowly, providing a more sustained lowering of blood glucose levels between meals and overnight.


**FAQs:**

* **How is it administered?**  This insulin is administered via subcutaneous injection (under the skin) using a syringe or insulin pen.
* **How often is it injected?** The frequency of injection depends on individual needs and is determined by a doctor. It's typically injected once or twice a day, often before meals.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Consult your doctor or diabetes educator on how to proceed if you miss a dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Can I mix it with other insulins?**  Generally, mixing this premixed insulin with other insulins is not recommended unless specifically advised by your doctor or diabetes educator.
* **How do I store it?** Store unopened vials in the refrigerator. Once opened, store the vial at room temperature, protected from light and heat.  Dispose of unused insulin properly.
* **What are the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?**  Be aware of the symptoms mentioned in the Side Effects section. Always carry a source of fast-acting sugar to treat low blood sugar.
* **What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** Seek immediate medical attention.
