# Irbesartan
### Generic Name
Irbesartan

### Usage

Irbesartan is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.  This lowers the pressure on the artery walls.  A secondary, crucial use is in managing diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease) in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have high blood pressure, elevated creatinine levels (a marker of kidney function), and protein in their urine (proteinuria).  This helps slow the progression of kidney damage.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** The typical starting dose is 150 mg once daily.  For patients with low blood volume (intravascular volume depletion), the initial dose may be 75 mg once daily. The maximum dose is generally 300 mg daily.
* **Diabetic Nephropathy:** The usual dose is 300 mg once daily.

**Children:**

Dosage for children depends on age and weight and should be determined by a physician.  Irbesartan's safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 6 years old.  For those aged 6-12, the starting dose may be 75 mg daily, with a maximum of 150 mg. Adolescents may start with 150 mg daily, increasing to a maximum of 300 mg if needed.  For children with chronic kidney disease, dosing is weight-based, starting at 37.5 mg daily for children weighing 10-20 kg, 75 mg for those weighing 21-40 kg, and 150 mg for those over 40 kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dose adjustment is usually needed for those with mild to moderate liver impairment.  For those with kidney problems (renal impairment), adjustment may not be necessary unless the patient is also volume depleted. Irbesartan isn't removed by hemodialysis.

**Administration:** Irbesartan is typically taken orally once daily. The capsules can be opened and mixed with a small amount of applesauce if swallowing difficulties exist.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Heartburn
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) – Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) – Seek immediate medical attention.
* Low blood pressure (hypotension), particularly upon standing.
* Changes in kidney function.
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).
* Increased liver enzymes.
*  Anemia (low red blood cell count).
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow, increasing blood pressure. Irbesartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II on its receptors in blood vessels. This prevents the vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and reduces the release of aldosterone (a hormone that regulates salt and water balance), ultimately lowering blood pressure.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Irbesartan is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, due to potential harm to the developing fetus.  It should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.  Consider alternatives if pregnancy is planned.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether Irbesartan passes into breast milk.  Carefully weigh the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* **Kidney Disease:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing kidney problems. Close monitoring of kidney function is necessary.
* **Liver Disease:**  Usually no dose adjustment is needed, but your doctor may monitor your liver function.
* **Drug Interactions:** Irbesartan can interact with other medications, particularly ACE inhibitors, other antihypertensives, potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, and NSAIDs. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking. Aliskiren is contraindicated with Irbesartan in patients with diabetes and moderate-to-severe renal impairment.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with known allergies to Irbesartan should avoid it.
* **Volume Depletion:**  Be cautious in patients with low blood volume as it can exacerbate hypotension.
* **Surgery/Anesthesia:**  Inform your anesthesiologist or surgeon about your Irbesartan use.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Irbesartan suddenly?**  A: No, always consult your doctor before stopping Irbesartan.  Sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.
* **Q: Can I take Irbesartan with food?** A: It can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store Irbesartan?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is Irbesartan safe for elderly patients?** A:  While generally safe, elderly patients may require closer monitoring for side effects, especially hypotension.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience angioedema?** A: This is a serious side effect. Seek immediate medical attention.
