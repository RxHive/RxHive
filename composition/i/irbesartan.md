# Irbesartan

**Generic Name:** Irbesartan

**Usage:**

Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It lowers blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.  It may be used alone or in combination with other medications.
* **Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease in people with diabetes):** It helps slow the progression of kidney damage in people with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Upper respiratory infection
* Back pain


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood):**  Especially in patients with kidney problems or those taking potassium supplements.  Symptoms may include muscle weakness, fatigue, and irregular heartbeat.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** A serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Cough:** Less common than with ACE inhibitors.
* **Kidney problems:**  May worsen existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare but can be serious.


**How it Works:**

Irbesartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, irbesartan allows blood vessels to relax and widen, lowering blood pressure.  This also reduces the strain on the heart and kidneys.
