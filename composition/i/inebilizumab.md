# Inebilizumab
### Generic Name
Inebilizumab

### Usage
Inebilizumab is a medication used to treat neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adults.  Specifically, it's indicated for those who test positive for anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies. NMOSD is a rare, severe autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), leading to inflammation and damage.  Inebilizumab helps manage the disease by reducing the frequency and severity of relapses (flare-ups).  It's currently not approved for other conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):**

Inebilizumab is administered intravenously (IV) by infusion.  

* **Initial Dose:** A 300 mg infusion is given, followed by a second 300 mg infusion two weeks later.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  A single 300 mg infusion is given every 6 months, starting 6 months after the initial doses.

**Important Considerations for Administration:**

* **Premedication:** Before each infusion, premedication with an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine), an antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen), and a corticosteroid (e.g., methylprednisolone) is typically given to reduce the risk and severity of infusion reactions.
* **Vaccination:**  All vaccines should be administered at least 4 weeks before starting Inebilizumab.
* **Baseline Tests:** Before treatment begins, tests for serum immunoglobulins, hepatitis B (HBsAg and anti-HBc), and active tuberculosis should be conducted.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Inebilizumab have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Urinary tract infection
* Decreased neutrophils (a type of white blood cell)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Antibody development
* Influenza (flu)
* Arthralgia (joint pain) and back pain
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold) and upper respiratory tract infection
* Infusion-related reactions


**Other Side Effects:**  Decreased serum immunoglobulins.  


**Serious Side Effects (Less Frequent but Potentially Severe):**  While less common, serious side effects can occur.  It's crucial to contact a doctor immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as signs of infection (fever, persistent cough, etc.), or neurological changes.


### How it Works

Inebilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD19, a protein found on the surface of B cells (a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response).  By binding to CD19, Inebilizumab triggers the destruction of these B cells. In NMOSD,  dysfunctional B cells contribute to the autoimmune attack on the central nervous system. By reducing the number of these cells, Inebilizumab helps to decrease inflammation and prevent further damage to the brain and spinal cord. The exact mechanism isn't fully understood but this targeted B-cell depletion is believed to be the primary way it works.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Inebilizumab should not be used in individuals with:

* A history of a life-threatening infusion reaction to Inebilizumab.
* Active hepatitis B infection.
* Active or untreated latent tuberculosis.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions are possible. Premedication helps minimize this risk.
* **Infections:** Inebilizumab can lower the body's ability to fight infections.  It's important to report any signs of infection immediately.
* **Immunoglobulin Reduction:** Inebilizumab can lower immunoglobulin levels. Regular monitoring is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Inebilizumab may harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment. The decision to breastfeed while taking this medication should be made in consultation with a doctor, weighing the benefits of breastfeeding against the potential risk to the infant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with immunosuppressants may increase the risk of infection.
