# Ibuprofen (systemic)
### Generic Name
Ibuprofen (systemic)

### Usage

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat a range of conditions characterized by pain, inflammation, and fever.  Its primary use is for the relief of mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, and toothaches.  It's also effective in reducing fever.  

Beyond its common uses, ibuprofen finds application in more specialized contexts:

* **Closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA):**  In premature infants, intravenous ibuprofen can help close a PDA, a persistent opening between the aorta and pulmonary artery.

* **Inflammatory diseases and rheumatoid disorders:**  Ibuprofen is used in managing the symptoms of inflammatory conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

* **Migraine:** While not always the first-line treatment, ibuprofen can be used for migraine pain relief.

The specific formulation (oral, intravenous) will influence the appropriate conditions it addresses.


### Dosage

Ibuprofen dosage varies significantly based on the formulation (oral, intravenous), the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of symptoms.  It is crucial to follow a healthcare provider's instructions precisely.  The following information is for general understanding and should not replace professional medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **Oral (immediate-release):** Doses typically range from 200 to 800 mg every 4 to 6 hours, as needed, but can vary widely depending on the condition. The maximum daily dose is generally 3200 mg.

* **Oral (sustained-release):**  Doses typically start lower and may be increased, but always within the guidelines set by the healthcare provider.

* **Intravenous:**  Dosage and administration rate are strictly determined by a healthcare provider and depend on the specific condition.  Patients receiving IV ibuprofen should be adequately hydrated.


**Children:**

Ibuprofen dosage for children is strictly weight-based and age-dependent. It is critical to use age and weight-appropriate dosage formulations and to strictly follow the recommendations on the product packaging or from the healthcare provider. Never exceed the recommended dosage.  Intravenous ibuprofen use in children requires careful monitoring under the supervision of a medical professional.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Over-the-counter (OTC) formulations:** OTC ibuprofen products often have lower maximum daily doses than those prescribed by doctors.

* **Duration of use:**  Long-term use of ibuprofen should only be under a healthcare provider's supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of ibuprofen include:

* Nausea
* Heartburn
* Stomach pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation or diarrhea

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* High blood pressure
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers (serious, potentially fatal)
* Cardiovascular problems (increased risk of heart attack or stroke)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ibuprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.  COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, ibuprofen alleviates these symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Ibuprofen should not be taken by individuals with a known allergy to ibuprofen, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.  Those with asthma or other allergies should exercise caution.

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Ibuprofen can increase the risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding.  Patients with a history of stomach ulcers, gastritis, or bleeding should use ibuprofen with caution, potentially under medical supervision.

* **Kidney and liver problems:** Ibuprofen can affect kidney and liver function, so patients with pre-existing conditions should use it cautiously and under close medical supervision.

* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Ibuprofen use during pregnancy, especially the third trimester, is generally discouraged due to potential risks to the fetus.  Discuss ibuprofen use with a healthcare provider if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Interactions:** Ibuprofen can interact with other medications.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting ibuprofen.

* **Alcohol:** Combining ibuprofen with alcohol can increase the risk of stomach bleeding.


### FAQs

* **Can I take ibuprofen with other medications?**   It's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  Some medications should not be taken concurrently with ibuprofen.

* **How should I store ibuprofen?** Store ibuprofen at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Follow the storage instructions on the product label.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** If you miss a dose of ibuprofen, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **How long can I take ibuprofen?**  Short-term use of ibuprofen for pain and fever is generally safe. For longer-term use, especially for chronic conditions, it's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's guidance.

* **Is ibuprofen safe for everyone?**  While generally safe for many, ibuprofen has potential risks for certain individuals, like those with allergies, gastrointestinal issues, kidney or liver disease, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Always consult a doctor before starting ibuprofen, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.

* **Can ibuprofen cause any serious side effects?** While rare, serious side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events, are possible. These are more likely with long-term use or in people with certain risk factors.
