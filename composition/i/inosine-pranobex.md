# Inosine Pranobex
### Generic Name
Inosine Pranobex

### Usage
Inosine pranobex is primarily used to treat subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare and progressive brain disease caused by a measles virus infection.  It's crucial to understand that this is a serious condition, and Inosine pranobex is not a cure but rather a treatment aimed at potentially slowing the disease's progression and managing symptoms.  There are currently no other widely approved uses for this medication.

### Dosage

**Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE):**

* **Oral Administration:** The typical dosage is 50 mg/kg/day, divided into 3-4 equal doses throughout the waking hours.  The maximum daily dose is 3 grams.  This dosage applies to both adults and children.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using Inosine pranobex in patients with kidney problems.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on appropriate dosage in such cases.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Nervousness
* Skin rash (pruritus)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Upset stomach
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Increased urination
* Elevated uric acid levels (hyperuricemia)


Less common but potentially serious side effects may occur.  It's vital to report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

The precise mechanism of how Inosine pranobex works isn't completely understood. However, it's believed to function through two main actions:  It possesses antiviral properties that may directly combat the measles virus, and it also appears to modulate the immune system, potentially boosting the body's natural defenses against the virus. This dual action may contribute to slowing the progression of SSPE.  It's thought to achieve this by influencing the activity of T-lymphocytes and macrophages (types of immune cells) and by affecting the production of cytokines (signaling molecules in the immune system).

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Inosine pranobex should not be used during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Kidney and Liver Impairment:**  Caution is advised in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary, and close monitoring is recommended.
* **Gout, Kidney Stones:** Individuals with a history of gout, kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), or bladder stones (urolithiasis) should use Inosine pranobex with caution due to the potential for increased uric acid levels.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions aren't extensively documented, it's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
