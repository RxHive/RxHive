# Isocarboxazid
### Generic Name
Isocarboxazid

### Usage
Isocarboxazid is primarily used to treat depression, specifically in individuals who haven't responded to other antidepressant treatments.  It's a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), a class of antidepressants that work differently than more commonly prescribed options like SSRIs or SNRIs.  Isocarboxazid is generally considered a second- or third-line treatment option for depression due to its potential for significant drug interactions and the need for strict dietary restrictions.  It's not typically the first medication a doctor will prescribe.


### Dosage
Dosage of isocarboxazid needs to be carefully tailored by a healthcare professional.  It is crucial to follow their guidance precisely.  Generally, for adults treating depression, the initial dose is 10 mg twice daily.  This dose may be gradually increased, typically in increments of 10 mg every 2-4 days, under close medical supervision, to a maximum of 60 mg per day, divided into several doses. This titration process usually takes several weeks, and it may take 3-6 weeks to notice any effects.  Once the optimal dose is achieved, it may be reduced to the lowest effective level.  If there is no response after 6 weeks at the maximum dose, further increases are unlikely to be beneficial.  

There is no established safe and effective dosage for children, so this medication is not recommended for pediatric use.

The dosage may need to be adjusted in individuals with kidney or liver problems. Isocarboxazid is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment and those with a history of liver disease or abnormal liver function tests.  Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment should be monitored closely.

Switching between isocarboxazid and other antidepressants, particularly other MAOIs, requires careful attention to washout periods to avoid dangerous interactions. Consult a physician for specific guidelines on transitioning between medications.

### How it Works
Isocarboxazid is a non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine in the brain. By inhibiting MAO, isocarboxazid increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, leading to improved mood and a reduction in depressive symptoms.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Isocarboxazid is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in several situations, including: hypersensitivity to the drug; cardiovascular diseases (including hypertension); cerebrovascular disease; history of severe headaches; history of liver disease; severe kidney impairment; and concurrent use of a wide range of other medications (see interactions below).  It's also contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland).

**Drug Interactions:** Isocarboxazid has numerous and potentially dangerous interactions with other drugs.  This includes other MAOIs, antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs), sympathomimetics (like decongestants, asthma medications, or amphetamines), certain pain medications, CNS depressants (like alcohol or opioids), antihypertensives, and many others. Combining isocarboxazid with these drugs can lead to serious or even life-threatening consequences. A detailed list of interacting drugs should be obtained from a medical professional.

**Dietary Restrictions:**  Individuals taking isocarboxazid must strictly avoid foods high in tyramine (aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented foods, etc.), as well as excessive caffeine. Tyramine can trigger a dangerous surge in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) when combined with MAOIs.

**Other Precautions:** Isocarboxazid should be used with caution in individuals with diabetes, a history of drug abuse, renal impairment, hyperthyroidism, a history of seizures, or those at risk of seizures.  It should be discontinued at least 10 days before elective surgery requiring general anesthesia.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a physician before initiating treatment as the safety of isocarboxazid in these situations is not fully established.  Older adults and individuals with pre-existing conditions may be particularly susceptible to the side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for isocarboxazid to work?**  A: It may take 3-6 weeks to notice a significant improvement in symptoms.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking isocarboxazid?** A: No. Alcohol interacts dangerously with MAOIs and should be strictly avoided.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Contact your doctor for advice.

* **Q: How should I store isocarboxazid?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place, away from children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking isocarboxazid suddenly?** A: No. Always gradually reduce your dose under your doctor's supervision to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: What should I do if I have a hypertensive crisis?** A: Seek immediate medical attention; this is a life-threatening emergency.
