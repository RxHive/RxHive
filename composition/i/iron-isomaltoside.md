# Iron Isomaltoside
### Generic Name
Iron Isomaltoside (also known as Ferric Derisomaltose)

### Usage
Iron isomaltoside is primarily used to treat iron-deficiency anemia in adult patients.  This is particularly relevant for individuals who cannot tolerate oral iron supplements or have not responded well to oral treatments. It's also indicated for those with non-hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD).  While not its primary use, it has been evaluated for use following postpartum hemorrhage.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Iron isomaltoside dosage is expressed in milligrams (mg) of elemental iron.

**Iron-Deficiency Anemia (IDA):**

* **Patients weighing â‰¥50 kg:** A single 1000 mg IV infusion over at least 20 minutes. Repeat the dose if anemia recurs.
* **Patients weighing <50 kg:** A single IV infusion of 20 mg/kg of actual body weight over at least 20 minutes. Repeat the dose if anemia recurs.

**Specific Product Labeling Considerations (IV):**

* **Injection 50 mg/mL:** Up to 200 mg per dose.
* **Maximum weekly dose:** 1000 mg.

**Cumulative Doses:** Before administration, the cumulative dose should be carefully determined based on the patient's weight and hemoglobin level. A single IV infusion should not exceed 20 mg of iron per kg of body weight. Doses exceeding 20 mg iron/kg must be split into two infusions administered at least one week apart. IV bolus injections should not exceed 500 mg three times per week.  Additional guidelines based on weight and hemoglobin levels may be found in product-specific labeling.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of iron isomaltoside in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment. However,  avoid use in patients with hepatic dysfunction (ALT and/or AST >3 times the upper limit of normal) and it's contraindicated in those with decompensated liver disease. For obese patients, it's recommended to use ideal body weight when calculating cumulative doses.

### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Nausea
* Skin rash
* Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels)

**Less Common (<1%):**

* Asthma
* Infusion-related reactions
* Severe hypersensitivity reactions

**Post-Marketing Reports (frequency not specified):**  A wide range of side effects have been reported after the drug's release, including abdominal pain, anaphylaxis, anxiety, arthralgia, back pain, chest pain, chills, constipation, cough, diaphoresis, diarrhea, dizziness, dysgeusia, dyspnea, erythema, fatigue, fever, flu-like symptoms, flushing, headache, hypersensitivity reactions, hypertension, hypotension, increased liver enzymes, loss of consciousness, muscle spasm, myalgia, nausea and vomiting, non-immune anaphylaxis, paresthesia, phlebitis, pruritus, seizure, shock, skin discoloration, syncope, tachycardia, and urticaria.


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Iron isomaltoside is an iron complex that releases iron into the body.  The iron binds to transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the bloodstream.  This iron is then delivered to erythroid precursor cells (cells that develop into red blood cells) in the bone marrow, where it is incorporated into hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. By increasing iron levels, iron isomaltoside helps to correct iron deficiency anemia and improve oxygen-carrying capacity.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Iron isomaltoside is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, decompensated liver disease, non-iron deficiency anemia (e.g., hemolytic anemia), and iron overload (e.g., hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis).

**Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), iron overload, and hypotension.

**Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using iron isomaltoside in elderly patients and in patients with acute or chronic infections. Avoid use in patients with ongoing bacteremia and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Oral iron is generally preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy.  Iron isomaltoside may be considered in the second and third trimesters for iron-deficiency anemia. It is excreted in breast milk, so monitor breastfed infants for gastrointestinal side effects.

**Drug Interactions:** Consult with your doctor about any potential interactions with other medications before starting iron isomaltoside therapy.


### FAQs

**Q: How is iron isomaltoside administered?**
A: It's administered intravenously (IV) either as a slow injection or infusion.  The specific administration method and rate will be determined by your doctor.

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**
A:  The response time varies depending on the individual and the severity of the anemia.  However, improvements in hemoglobin levels and other blood parameters are generally seen over time.

**Q: How should I store iron isomaltoside?**
A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the product label.

**Q: Are there any tests needed before or after treatment?**
A:  Yes.  Blood tests to assess your iron status (e.g., hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin) are typically performed before and after treatment to monitor the effectiveness and safety of the medication.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Consult your healthcare provider immediately for guidance.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage yourself.
