# Ivermectin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Ivermectin (Systemic)

### Usage

Ivermectin is a semisynthetic drug primarily used to treat parasitic infections.  Its main applications are in the treatment of onchocerciasis (river blindness), caused by the immature form of *Onchocerca volvulus*, and intestinal strongyloidiasis, caused by *Strongyloides stercoralis*.  Importantly,  **Ivermectin should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19.**  This has been explicitly stated in revised guidelines and is not supported by robust scientific evidence.

While primarily used for these two conditions, ivermectin also sees off-label use in treating several other parasitic infections, including: ascariasis (*Ascaris lumbricoides*), demodicosis (*Demodex folliculorum* and *Demodex brevis*), gnathostomiasis (*Gnathostoma spinigerum*), hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans, lice (different species), *Mansonella ozzardi* infection, *Mansonella streptocerca* infection, scabies (*Sarcoptes scabiei*), trichuriasis (*Trichuris trichiura*), and *Wuchereria bancrofti* infection.  These off-label uses often involve different dosage regimens and should only be considered under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's weight, and their age.  The following information is for guidance only and should not replace a healthcare provider's prescription. Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**  Dosage is typically calculated based on body weight (mcg/kg).  For example, treatment for onchocerciasis might involve a single 150 mcg/kg oral dose, while intestinal strongyloidiasis may require 200 mcg/kg/day for one to two days.  Dosages for off-label uses vary considerably and are often administered as single or multiple doses spread over several days or weeks.  Specific dosages for off-label conditions are detailed in the provided source material.


**Children:** Pediatric dosages are also weight-based (mcg/kg), but the use of ivermectin in children under 2 years or weighing less than 15 kg should be approached cautiously.  Dosage and suitability should be determined by a physician based on age, weight and the specific infection.

**Administration:** Ivermectin is typically administered orally, usually with water. However, for specific conditions like scabies or pediculosis pubis, taking it with food may improve absorption.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin reactions
* Lymphadenitis (swollen lymph nodes)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Synovitis (joint inflammation)
* Fever

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in less than 10% of patients, or reported post-marketing) may include:

* Dizziness
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in extremities)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils in blood)
* Liver enzyme abnormalities
*  A wider range of serious side effects, including neurological issues (seizures, coma), skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) and many others, are reported in rare cases or post-marketing surveillance.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning side effects.**


### How it Works

Ivermectin is an anthelmintic (anti-parasitic) drug. It works by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This increases the permeability of cell membranes to chloride ions, causing hyperpolarization (a change in the electrical potential of the cell) and ultimately leading to paralysis and death of the parasites.  It is important to note that ivermectin has no effect on the adult *Onchocerca volvulus* parasites.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Ivermectin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to ivermectin or any of its components.
* **Pediatric Use:**  Use in children younger than 2 years or weighing less than 15 kg should be approached cautiously, as there's a higher risk of CNS effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ivermectin is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully weighed against potential risks and benefits.  A healthcare provider should be consulted.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ivermectin can interact with several other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before starting ivermectin.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not generally recommended for hepatic or renal impairment, but this should be discussed with your physician.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ivermectin to prevent COVID-19?** A: No, Ivermectin is not an effective treatment or preventative measure for COVID-19.  This is strongly advised against based on current medical consensus.

* **Q: How should I store ivermectin?** A: Store ivermectin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to discuss the appropriate course of action. Do not double the dose without consulting your physician.

* **Q: Is ivermectin safe?** A:  Ivermectin is generally safe when used as directed by a healthcare professional. However, like all medications, it carries potential side effects.  Following prescribed dosages and reporting any adverse effects is crucial.

* **Q: Can ivermectin cure all parasitic infections?** A: No, ivermectin's effectiveness varies depending on the specific parasite.  It's not effective against all types of parasitic infections.
