# Ibuprofen Lysine (Injection)
### Generic Name
Ibuprofen Lysine (Injection)

### Usage
Ibuprofen lysine injection is specifically indicated for the closure of a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature infants.  This is a condition where a blood vessel (ductus arteriosus) that normally closes shortly after birth remains open, potentially causing serious circulatory problems.  This medication is used when standard medical management (such as fluid restriction, diuretics, and respiratory support) proves ineffective.  It's crucial to remember that ibuprofen lysine injection is *not* indicated for use in adults.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** All dosages are based on the infant's birth weight.  Ibuprofen lysine is administered intravenously (IV).

* **Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA):** The typical regimen involves an initial dose of 10 mg/kg, followed by two additional doses of 5 mg/kg each, given 24 and 48 hours after the initial dose.  
* **Renal Impairment:** If the infant shows signs of significantly reduced urine output (less than 0.6 mL/kg/h),  further doses should be withheld until kidney function returns to normal, as indicated by laboratory tests.  In fact, ibuprofen lysine is contraindicated in premature infants with significant renal impairment.
* **Second Course:** If the PDA doesn't close or reopens after the first course, a second course of ibuprofen lysine, alternative medication, or surgery may be necessary.  This decision should be made by the healthcare provider.

### Side Effects
Ibuprofen lysine, like other medications, can cause side effects.  These can vary in frequency and severity.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Gastrointestinal problems:  Non-necrotizing enterocolitis
* Skin lesions or irritation
* Respiratory infections and apnea (temporary pauses in breathing)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Anemia and bleeding
* Intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)
* Sepsis (severe bloodstream infection)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Respiratory failure and atelectasis (collapsed lung)
* Adrenal insufficiency (failure of the adrenal glands)
* Renal failure, renal impairment, decreased urine output, increased blood creatinine and urea levels
* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and edema (swelling)

**Important:**  Any side effect, whether listed here or not, should be reported to the healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism by which ibuprofen lysine closes the PDA in newborns isn't fully understood.  However, in adults, ibuprofen is known to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, substances involved in maintaining the ductus arteriosus open.  It's suspected that a similar mechanism may be at play in newborns, although further research is needed.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ibuprofen lysine is contraindicated (should not be used) in premature infants with untreated infections, certain types of congenital heart disease where PDA patency is crucial, active bleeding, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), coagulation defects, suspected or existing necrotizing enterocolitis, or significant renal impairment.
* **Increased Risk:**  This medication may alter the usual signs of infection and increase the risk of bleeding.
* **Caution:** Ibuprofen lysine should be used cautiously in infants with elevated total bilirubin levels.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with diuretics might reduce their effectiveness, and diuretics can increase the risk of kidney problems. Ibuprofen can also decrease the clearance of amikacin (an antibiotic). Close monitoring is required when using ibuprofen lysine with other drugs.

### FAQs
* **Q: How is ibuprofen lysine injection administered?** A: It is given intravenously (IV) and should be diluted and infused over 15 minutes.
