# Ivermectin + Albendazole

**Generic Name:** Ivermectin + Albendazole (Combination product; note that this is not a universally approved or available fixed-dose combination.  Many formulations are single-drug.)

**Usage:**  The combination of ivermectin and albendazole is primarily used in veterinary medicine, particularly for the treatment of internal and external parasites in livestock (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats) and sometimes companion animals.  **Human use of this specific combination is not widely approved or recommended by major health organizations.**  While both drugs are used individually in humans for specific parasitic infections, the combined efficacy and safety in a fixed-dose formulation aren't established for widespread human use.  Individual drugs are used as follows:

* **Ivermectin:** Used to treat various parasitic infections in humans including onchocerciasis (river blindness), strongyloidiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and some types of scabies and lice.
* **Albendazole:** Used in humans to treat a variety of intestinal worm infections like ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm infections, and also cysticercosis (caused by tapeworm larvae).


**Side Effects:** The side effects will vary depending on the dose and individual factors, and also depend on which drug (or both) is used.  Side effects for each drug individually are:

* **Ivermectin:** Common side effects are mild and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and fatigue.  In rare cases, more serious side effects such as allergic reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), encephalopathy (especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions), and liver damage can occur.
* **Albendazole:** Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.  More severe side effects are rare but can include bone marrow suppression, liver damage, and allergic reactions.

**When used together:** The combined side effects are potentially additive, increasing the risk of experiencing any of the above side effects.   This is precisely why the combination needs careful study before it can be safely used in humans.


**How it Works:**

* **Ivermectin:**  Paralyzes and kills parasites by binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells.  This leads to disruption of neuromuscular transmission and parasite death.
* **Albendazole:** Interferes with microtubule polymerization in parasites, affecting their metabolism and reproduction, ultimately leading to their death.  The exact mechanism is not fully elucidated but involves disruption of essential cellular functions.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination approved for human use?** No, a fixed-dose combination of ivermectin and albendazole is not widely approved for human use by major regulatory agencies like the FDA (in the US) or EMA (in Europe).  The drugs are used individually as needed.
* **Can I take ivermectin and albendazole together?**  Only under the strict guidance of a physician.  Self-medicating with this combination is highly discouraged due to potential interactions and side effects.  A doctor can assess your specific needs and determine the appropriate and safest treatment.
* **Is this combination effective against all parasites?** No.  Both drugs have specific targets, and their effectiveness varies depending on the type of parasite.
* **Where can I get this combination?**  It is primarily available in veterinary settings for animal use.  Human use requires a
