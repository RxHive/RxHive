# Ivermectin  + Albendazole
### Generic Name
Ivermectin + Albendazole


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat soil-transmitted helminth infections, particularly strongyloidiasis (roundworm infection) and ascariasis (roundworm infection), often in cases of co-infection with both parasites.  It's also sometimes used for treating other parasitic infections, but this is less common and usually only considered by specialists in infectious diseases. The combined effect of ivermectin and albendazole targets different stages and species of parasitic worms, increasing the effectiveness of treatment compared to using either drug alone.  It's crucial to remember that this combination should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional who can properly diagnose the parasitic infection and determine the appropriate dosage.  Self-medication can be dangerous and ineffective.


### Dosage

Dosage for Ivermectin + Albendazole combination therapy is highly variable and depends on several factors, including the specific parasite(s) being treated, the patient's age, weight, and overall health, and the severity of the infection.  There isn't a standardized, universally accepted dosage regimen for this combination.  The medication is typically administered orally.  A healthcare professional will determine the correct dosage and duration of treatment based on an individual patient's needs.  There are no commonly available IV formulations of this specific combination.  **It is crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.**  Do not attempt to determine the dosage on your own.  Dosage information for single-drug ivermectin and albendazole can be found in their respective drug information sheets.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of ivermectin and albendazole when taken together may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Itching

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver damage (indicated by jaundice, dark urine, or light-colored stools)
* Neurologic effects (seizures, tremors, confusion)

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Ivermectin and albendazole work through different mechanisms to eliminate parasitic worms. Ivermectin paralyzes the parasites, interfering with their neuromuscular function, which causes them to detach from the intestinal wall and be passed out of the body.  Albendazole inhibits the synthesis of microtubules within the parasites, impacting their growth and reproduction, ultimately leading to their death.  The combination is synergistic, meaning the effect of the two drugs together is greater than the sum of their individual effects.

* **Liver Function:**  Patients with pre-existing liver problems should use this medication with caution, as both ivermectin and albendazole can affect liver function.  Regular liver function monitoring may be needed.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Albendazole can interact with certain medications, such as warfarin (a blood thinner).  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Children:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for children based on their weight and age. A healthcare professional should always determine the appropriate dose.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.
