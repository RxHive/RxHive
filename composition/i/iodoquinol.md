# Iodoquinol
### Generic Name
Iodoquinol

### Usage
Iodoquinol is an antiprotozoal medication primarily used to treat intestinal amebiasis, an infection of the intestines caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  It's important to note that due to the potential for serious side effects, its use is now limited and it's not the first-line treatment for this condition. Other medications are generally preferred.

### Dosage

**Intestinal Amebiasis:**

* **Adults:** The typical adult dose is 650 mg three times daily (TID) for 20 days. The maximum daily dose is 1.95 g.
* **Children:** The usual pediatric dose is 30-40 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into three doses.  The maximum dose per dose is 650 mg, and treatment should last for 20 days.  The maximum daily dose is 1.95 g.

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in manufacturer labeling.  Always consult a doctor for appropriate dosing.  The medication is usually taken after meals.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Chills
* Fever
* Headache
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rashes
* Hives (urticaria)
* Thyroid enlargement
* Abdominal cramps
* Anal itching
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common, but serious side effects include:

* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve)
* Optic atrophy (degeneration of the optic nerve)

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as serious, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works
The precise mechanism of how iodoquinol works against *Entamoeba histolytica* isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to act within the intestinal lumen (the inside space of the intestine) to exert its amebicidal (amoeba-killing) effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Iodoquinol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to iodine or iodoquinol itself, or any of the formulation's components.
* **Increased Risk:**  Long-term use significantly increases the risk of peripheral neuropathy, optic neuritis, and optic atrophy.
* **Cautious Use:**  Use with caution in patients with thyroid abnormalities (as it can interfere with thyroid function tests), and in children and older adults.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Iodoquinol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the potential risks to a developing fetus haven't been fully established. It's not recommended during breastfeeding because its excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although specific interactions aren't extensively documented, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, before starting iodoquinol.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store iodoquinol?** A:  Store iodoquinol as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking iodoquinol if I feel better?** A: No, complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if symptoms improve. Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and potential recurrence of the infection.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q:  Are there any dietary restrictions while taking iodoquinol?** A: It's generally recommended to take iodoquinol after meals.  Consult with your doctor or pharmacist for specific dietary recommendations.
* **Q:  Is iodoquinol safe for long-term use?** A: No, long-term use of iodoquinol is not recommended due to the increased risk of serious side effects, particularly those affecting the eyes and nerves.
