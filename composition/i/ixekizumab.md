# Ixekizumab
### Generic Name
Ixekizumab

### Usage

Ixekizumab is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults and children aged 6 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  This means it's used when other treatments haven't been effective enough.  Beyond psoriasis, it's also approved for treating adults with active psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (a type of inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine).  In all these conditions, Ixekizumab helps to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated.  It's administered subcutaneously (under the skin) using a pre-filled syringe or autoinjector.

* **Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis:** Typically starts with 160 mg (two 80 mg injections) at week 0, followed by 80 mg at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then 80 mg every 4 weeks thereafter.
* **Psoriatic arthritis and Ankylosing spondylitis:** Usually begins with 160 mg (two 80 mg injections) once, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks.  It can be used alone or with other medications.
* **Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis:**  Typically 80 mg every 4 weeks.

**Children (aged â‰¥6 years):** The dose is weight-based for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis:

* Less than 25 kg: 40 mg once, then 20 mg every 4 weeks.
* 25-50 kg: 80 mg once, then 40 mg every 4 weeks.
* 50 kg or more: 160 mg (two 80 mg injections) once, then 80 mg every 4 weeks.

Adolescents aged 18 and older follow the adult dosage regimen.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Infections in general
* Antibody development (the body may develop antibodies against the drug)


Less common but serious side effects (occurring in less than 10% of patients) may include:

* Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis)
* Serious hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a protein involved in inflammation.  By binding to IL-17A, Ixekizumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing the inflammatory process that underlies psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and other specified conditions. This leads to improvements in skin lesions, joint pain, and other symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Tuberculosis (TB):**  Patients should be screened for TB before starting Ixekizumab.  Treatment for latent TB may be necessary.
* **Infections:**  Ixekizumab can increase the risk of infections.  Those with a history of recurrent infections should be monitored closely.
* **Live vaccines:** Live vaccines should not be given during treatment with Ixekizumab.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  A serious allergic reaction is possible.  Stop treatment immediately and seek medical attention if such a reaction occurs.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The safety of Ixekizumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* **Hepatitis B and C:** Screening for Hepatitis B and C may be necessary before treatment.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Ixekizumab?** A:  There's no specific restriction on alcohol consumption, but moderation is always recommended. Discuss any concerns with your doctor.
