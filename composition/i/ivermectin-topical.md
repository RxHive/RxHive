# Ivermectin (Topical)
### Generic Name
Ivermectin (Topical)

### Usage
Ivermectin topical is used to treat two distinct conditions:

* **Pediculosis capitis (Head Lice):** This is its primary use.  Ivermectin topical lotion effectively eliminates head lice infestations by killing the adult lice and their eggs (nits).  It's a crucial treatment option for this common parasitic infection.

* **Inflammatory Lesions of Rosacea:**  Ivermectin is also used topically to treat the inflammatory aspects of rosacea, a chronic skin condition causing redness, bumps, and pimples primarily on the face. While its exact mechanism in treating rosacea isn't fully understood, it's effective in reducing inflammation and improving skin appearance.


### Dosage

**Pediculosis capitis (Head Lice):**

* **Adults and Children (6 months and older):** Apply a sufficient amount of the lotion (up to one entire tube) to completely cover the dry hair and scalp. Leave the lotion on for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with water.  Wait 24 hours before shampooing.  Discard any unused portion of the tube after application.

**Rosacea:**

* **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of the cream once daily (OD) to each affected area of the face (forehead, chin, nose, cheeks, etc.).

**Important Note:**  The dosage information above is a summary. Always follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist, and refer to the medication's package insert for complete details.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Localized burning sensation on the scalp (with lotion)
* Skin irritation

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Allergic dermatitis
* Conjunctivitis (eye inflammation)
* Contact dermatitis
* Eye irritation
* Ocular hyperemia (redness of the eyes)
* Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp
* Xeroderma (dry skin)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ivermectin's mechanism of action differs slightly depending on the condition being treated:

* **Head Lice:** Ivermectin is an anthelmintic (anti-parasite) drug. It works by binding to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in the nerve and muscle cells of lice. This increases chloride permeability, leading to nerve and muscle cell hyperpolarization and ultimately the death of the parasites.

* **Rosacea:** The precise mechanism of action for Ivermectin in treating rosacea isn't fully established. However, it's believed to reduce inflammation and improve skin appearance by influencing inflammatory processes in the skin.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ivermectin topical is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to ivermectin or any components of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:** While currently no significant drug interactions are widely documented for topical ivermectin, it's always best to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid any potential issues.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ivermectin is categorized as pregnancy category C.  This means that the potential benefits of using the medication during pregnancy may outweigh the potential risks, but it's crucial to discuss the use of ivermectin with your doctor during pregnancy. Ivermectin is excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.

* **Children:** Ivermectin topical lotion is generally safe and effective for head lice treatment in children aged 6 months and older.  Always adhere strictly to the prescribed dosage.

* **Other Precautions:**  For head lice treatment, wash clothing, bedding, and personal items in hot water or dry clean them to prevent re-infestation. With rosacea treatment, avoid contact with eyes and lips.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Ivermectin to work for head lice?** A: Usually, a single application of ivermectin lotion is sufficient to eliminate head lice.  However, careful checking and combing are necessary to remove any remaining nits (eggs).

* **Q: Can I use Ivermectin topical for other types of lice or scabies?** A: No. This formulation is specifically for head lice. Other treatments are needed for body lice, pubic lice, and scabies.

* **Q: How should I store Ivermectin topical?** A: Store at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally ingest Ivermectin topical?** A: This is an emergency. Contact your local poison control center or seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: Is Ivermectin topical safe for long-term use for rosacea?** A: The duration of treatment for rosacea varies depending on the individual and the severity of the condition.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment plan.  Always follow your doctor's advice.
