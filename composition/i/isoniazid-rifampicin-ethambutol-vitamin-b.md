# Isoniazid + Rifampicin + Ethambutol + Vitamin B

**Generic Name:** Isoniazid + Rifampicin + Ethambutol + Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)

**Usage:** This combination is used as a first-line treatment for tuberculosis (TB).  It's crucial to take all medications precisely as prescribed by a doctor, for the entire duration of treatment, even if you feel better.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug-resistant TB. This combination is often used for the initial phase of treatment, followed by a continuation phase with fewer drugs.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Some common side effects include:

* **Isoniazid:**  Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in the extremities), liver damage (rare but serious).  Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is often included to help prevent peripheral neuropathy.
* **Rifampicin:**  Orange discoloration of urine, sweat, and tears, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, liver damage (rare but serious).  It can also interact with many other medications, reducing their effectiveness or increasing their side effects.
* **Ethambutol:**  Eye problems (blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, color blindness), joint pain, rash.  Regular eye exams are recommended during treatment.
* **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6):** Generally well-tolerated, but high doses can cause nausea and fatigue.

**Serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:**

* Jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes) - indicative of liver damage
* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)
* Severe peripheral neuropathy (significant pain or loss of function)
* Significant vision changes

**How it Works:**

* **Isoniazid:** Interferes with the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall.
* **Rifampicin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing bacterial protein synthesis.
* **Ethambutol:** Inhibits arabinosyl transferase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of arabinogalactan, a component of the mycobacterial cell wall.
* **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6):**  Prevents or reduces the risk of peripheral neuropathy caused by isoniazid.
