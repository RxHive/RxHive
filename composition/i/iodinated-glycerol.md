# Iodinated Glycerol
### Generic Name
Iodinated Glycerol

### Usage
Iodinated glycerol is primarily used as a mucolytic expectorant.  This means it helps to thin and loosen thick mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up. It's used as an adjunctive therapy (meaning it's used alongside other treatments) for various respiratory conditions, including:

*   **Bronchitis:**  Inflammation of the bronchial tubes.
*   **Bronchial Asthma:** A chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation and narrowing.
*   **Pulmonary Emphysema:** A lung disease causing shortness of breath due to damaged air sacs.
*   **Cystic Fibrosis:** A genetic disorder affecting multiple organs, notably causing thick mucus buildup in the lungs.
*   **Chronic Sinusitis:**  Long-term inflammation of the sinuses.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage information provided here is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice. Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's specific instructions.

**Adults:** The typical oral dose is 60 mg (equivalent to 20 drops) four times a day (QID).

**Children:** The usual oral dose is up to half the adult dose.  The precise dosage for children should always be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.

**Forms:** Iodinated glycerol is typically available as an oral solution (drops).

**Administration:**  Take iodinated glycerol with a full glass of water.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Gastrointestinal issues: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

*   Headache

*   Dermatitis (skin inflammation)
*   Acute parotitis (inflammation of the salivary glands)
*   Thyroid gland enlargement
*   Gastrointestinal irritation
*   Eyelid edema (swelling)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Iodinated glycerol works by increasing the amount of thin fluid in the respiratory tract. This helps to break down and thin the thick, sticky mucus, making it easier to expel from the lungs and sinuses. Iodine, a component of this medication, is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and tends to concentrate in respiratory tract secretions.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Allergy or hypersensitivity to inorganic iodides, iodinated glycerol, or any components of the formulation.
*   Pregnancy:  Iodinated glycerol is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it is contraindicated during pregnancy.
*   Newborns:  Should not be used in newborns.


**Use with Caution:**

*   Patients with thyroid disease:  Monitor thyroid function carefully.
*   Patients with renal (kidney) impairment: Close monitoring is advised.
*   Breastfeeding:  Excretion in breast milk is not fully understood; use with caution and consult your doctor.

**Drug Interactions:**  Using iodinated glycerol with certain medications, such as disulfiram, metronidazole, procarbazine, MAO inhibitors, central nervous system depressants, or lithium, may increase the risk of toxicity. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
