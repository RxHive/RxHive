# Ioxitalamic Acid
### Generic Name
Ioxitalamic Acid (Ioxitalamate Meglumine)

### Usage
Ioxitalamic acid is an iodinated contrast medium primarily used as a contrast agent in various diagnostic imaging procedures.  Its primary role is to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and internal organs during X-ray examinations, making it easier for radiologists to identify abnormalities.  Specific uses include:

* **Angiography:**  Visualizing blood vessels to detect blockages, aneurysms, or other vascular problems.
* **Computed Tomography (CT):** Improving the clarity of CT scans of the brain, body, and other areas.
* **Urography:** Examining the urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, and bladder) to identify stones, obstructions, or infections.
* **Body Cavity Imaging:**  Improving visualization of the gastrointestinal tract (oral or rectal administration) and the uterus (hysterosalpingography).

### Dosage

**Dosage is highly individualized and dependent on the specific imaging procedure, patient weight, and the area to be examined.  Always follow the instructions of the prescribing physician.** The information below provides general ranges; precise dosing should come directly from your doctor or radiologist.  The medication is typically administered intravenously (IV) or through other routes (oral, rectal, intrauterine) depending on the imaging technique.

**Adults:**  Dosage varies greatly based on the procedure and may be calculated as mL/kg (milliliters per kilogram of body weight) or a fixed total volume in mL. For example, in CT scans:

* **Brain CT:**  Iodine 300 mg/mL: Usual dose of 1.4 mL/kg (total dose range: 20–150 mL).
* **Whole Body CT:** Iodine 300 mg/mL: Usual dose of 1.9 mL/kg (total dose range: 20–150 mL).
* **Angiography:** Iodine 300 mg/mL: Volume depends on the area to be examined; do not exceed 4–5 mL/kg per dose (maximum: 100 mL per dose).
* **Urography:** Iodine 300 mg/mL: 1–2 mL/kg (total dose range: 50–100 mL).
* **Other Routes:** Dosage for oral, rectal, and intrauterine administration varies significantly based on the procedure and is determined by the physician.


**Children:** Pediatric dosages are also highly variable depending on the procedure, child's weight, and age.  Generally, lower doses are used, adjusted based on weight and procedure.  For example, in CT scans:

* **Brain CT:** Iodine 300 mg/mL: 1.4 mL/kg (maximum 150 mL).
* **Whole Body CT:** Iodine 300 mg/mL: Usually 1.9 mL/kg (maximum 150 mL).
* **Urography:**  Dosing varies based on the child's weight (below or above 20 kg).  The maximum dose is 100mL.
* **Other Routes:** Dosing for oral, and rectal administration in children is determined by the physician.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in manufacturer's labeling. However, caution is advised in patients with severe impairment of either organ, or in those with combined renal and hepatic disease.  Some manufacturers even contraindicate use in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Acute renal failure
* Cardiovascular problems (arrhythmias, hypotension)
* Neurological effects (seizures, headache)


**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Ioxitalamic acid is an iodinated contrast agent. Iodine atoms in the molecule absorb X-rays. When injected or administered into a body cavity, it temporarily increases the density of the tissues it passes through. This increased density allows for better visualization of blood vessels and organs during X-ray or CT imaging procedures, enabling radiologists to better diagnose various medical conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Known hypersensitivity to ioxitalamic acid or its components; severe thyroid disease; severe renal or hepatic impairment; and, depending on the administration route, other conditions (pregnancy, menstruation, certain infections, etc.).  Consult your physician for a complete list of contraindications.
* **Interactions:**  Ioxitalamic acid may interact with other medications, particularly diuretics, nephrotoxic drugs, and some cardiovascular medications.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Ioxitalamic acid is generally avoided during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.   The use of intrauterine, oral, and rectal formulations is contraindicated in pregnancy. Small amounts are excreted in breast milk; withholding breastfeeding for 24 hours after administration is recommended.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, asthma, history of allergic reactions, and those with kidney or liver problems.
* **Hydration:** Adequate hydration before and after administration is crucial to help minimize the risk of kidney problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for the effects of ioxitalamic acid to wear off?** A: The contrast agent is typically eliminated from the body within 24 hours, although this may vary.

* **Q: Is ioxitalamic acid safe?** A:  Ioxitalamic acid is generally safe when administered appropriately, but it does carry potential risks, especially allergic reactions and renal complications.  A healthcare professional assesses suitability for each patient.

* **Q: How should ioxitalamic acid be stored?** A: Store as directed by the manufacturer's labeling, usually at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of an allergic reaction (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).

* **Q:  Can I drive after receiving ioxitalamic acid?** A: This depends on your reaction and the procedure.  Follow your doctor's advice.  Some side effects like dizziness or drowsiness could impair driving ability.
