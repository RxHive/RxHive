# Iron

**Generic Name:** Ferrous Sulfate (and other ferrous salts like ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate)

**Usage:** Treatment and prevention of iron deficiency anemia.  Iron is a vital component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Iron deficiency leads to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.  Iron supplements are used when dietary intake is insufficient to meet the body's needs, such as during pregnancy, infancy, or in individuals with certain medical conditions.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects are gastrointestinal, including:

* **Constipation:** This is a very frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:** Often mild and can improve with food.
* **Abdominal pain:**  Can range from mild cramping to more severe discomfort.
* **Diarrhea:** Less common than constipation.
* **Dark stools:** This is harmless and a normal result of iron absorption.
* **Vomiting:**  Less common but can be a sign of an adverse reaction.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Stomach ulcers:**  Especially in those with pre-existing conditions.


**How it Works:**  Iron supplements provide elemental iron which is absorbed in the small intestine. The absorbed iron is then used by the bone marrow to produce hemoglobin, increasing the red blood cell count and improving oxygen-carrying capacity.  Different iron salts have varying bioavailability (how well the body absorbs them). Ferrous sulfate is relatively well-absorbed.

**FAQs:**

* **What should I take iron with?**  Taking iron with vitamin C can improve absorption.  Avoid taking iron supplements with calcium, antacids, or tea/coffee as these can interfere with absorption.
* **How much iron should I take?** The dosage varies greatly depending on the individual's needs and the type of iron supplement.  Always follow the instructions on the label or as directed by your doctor.
* **Can I take iron supplements long-term?** Long-term use should only be under the guidance of a doctor.  Excess iron can be toxic.
* **What are the signs of iron overload?**  Symptoms of iron overload (hemochromatosis) can include abdominal pain, joint pain, fatigue, skin darkening, and liver damage.  This is a serious condition and requires medical attention.
* **Are there any interactions with other medications?** Iron can interact with various medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and thyroid medications. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
* **Is iron safe during pregnancy?** Iron is often recommended during pregnancy to prevent anemia, but the dosage and type of iron supplement should be determined by a healthcare professional.
