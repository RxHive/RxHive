# Isosulfan Blue
### Generic Name
Isosulfan Blue

### Usage
Isosulfan blue is a contrast agent primarily used in lymphography.  It helps visualize lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes during procedures. This is particularly helpful in diagnosing and evaluating several conditions:

* **Lymphedema:**  Both primary (congenital) and secondary (acquired, often due to cancer treatment or surgery) lymphedema of the extremities. The dye helps doctors map the lymphatic system to better understand the extent of the blockage or damage.
* **Chyluria, Chylous Ascites, and Chylothorax:** These conditions involve leakage of lymphatic fluid into the urine (chyluria), abdominal cavity (chylous ascites), or chest cavity (chylothorax). Isosulfan blue aids in identifying the source of the leak.
* **Cancer Staging and Treatment Monitoring:**  The dye can help visualize lymph node involvement by primary or secondary neoplasms (cancers) and assess how well cancer treatment is affecting the lymphatic system.


### Dosage
**Lymphatic Vessel Delineation (Adults):**

* **Subcutaneous Injection:** An aqueous solution of 1% isosulfan blue is administered.  The typical dose is 0.5 mL injected into three interdigital spaces of each extremity per study.  The maximum dose is 3 mL (30 mg).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of isosulfan blue in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):**
    * Pruritus (itching)
    * Local swelling at the injection site
    * Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

* **Less Common (<1%, post-marketing reports):**
    * Anaphylaxis (severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
    * Skin discoloration (including blue urticariaâ€”hives)

**Important:**  If any adverse effects occur, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Isosulfan blue is a dye that binds to proteins in the blood.  Once bound, it's transported through the lymphatic system.  The blue color of the dye makes the lymphatic vessels visible during imaging procedures, allowing doctors to assess their structure and function.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Isosulfan blue is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to isosulfan blue, triphenylmethane dyes (or related compounds), or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients using isosulfan blue may have an increased risk of urine discoloration, hypersensitivity reactions (including life-threatening anaphylaxis), falsely elevated methemoglobin levels (requires co-oximetry for accurate assessment), and falsely elevated peripheral oxygenation measurements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Isosulfan blue is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  It's unknown whether isosulfan blue is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **General Precautions:**  The solution is for single-patient use only. Do not mix with local anesthetics (like lidocaine) in the same syringe due to precipitation. Closely monitor patients for at least 60 minutes after administration for hypersensitivity reactions.  Pulse oximetry readings may be falsely low due to isosulfan blue interference (peak interference at 30 minutes post-administration, minimal effect by ~4 hours).


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the blue color last?**  A: The duration of the blue coloration varies but generally fades over time.  The exact duration depends on the individual and the amount injected.

* **Q: Can isosulfan blue stain my clothes?** A: Yes, there's a risk of staining.  Take appropriate precautions.

* **Q: How is isosulfan blue stored?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature, protected from light.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives, or dizziness.

* **Q: Is isosulfan blue safe for everyone?** A: No, it's not safe for everyone.  It's contraindicated in individuals with known allergies and caution is needed in pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers. Always consult your doctor before using any medication.
