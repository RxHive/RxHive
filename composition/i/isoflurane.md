# Isoflurane
### Generic Name
Isoflurane

### Usage
Isoflurane is a general anesthetic used for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia during surgical procedures and other medical interventions requiring a loss of consciousness.  Its primary use is in the operating room to render patients unconscious and insensitive to pain. It's also used for the management of pain during certain diagnostic procedures where deep sedation is necessary.


### Dosage

**Anesthesia (Inhalation):**

* **Adults:** Induction typically begins with 1.5-3% isoflurane administered with oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide.  Maintenance anesthesia usually requires 1-2.5% isoflurane with nitrous oxide; if used with oxygen alone, an additional 0.5-1% isoflurane may be necessary.  Premedication choices depend on the patient's needs, considering that isoflurane mildly stimulates secretions and tends to increase heart rate.  Anticholinergic drugs might be used optionally.
* **Children:** Dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Shivering
* Coughing (often related to induction)
* Transient tachycardia (increased heart rate)
* Transient leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Malignant hyperthermia (a life-threatening condition)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing)
* Cognitive dysfunction (temporary impairment of mental function, which may persist for up to 3 days post-anesthesia)
* Mood changes (which may persist up to 6 days post-anesthesia)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including rare instances of hepatic failure, hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis (liver cell death) - these are typically idiosyncratic (unpredictable reactions specific to the individual).

**Note:** If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Isoflurane is an inhaled anesthetic that works by affecting the activity of ion channels in neurons (nerve cells).  It alters the action of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers in the brain, leading to a state of general anesthesia.  Specifically, it influences receptors for neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), and glutamate. This multifaceted action results in the loss of consciousness, pain sensation, and reflexes.  Additionally, isoflurane can depress myocardial contractility (the heart's ability to contract) and decrease blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance (the resistance to blood flow in the body's blood vessels) and sympathetic nervous activity.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Known allergy to isoflurane or other halogenated anesthetic agents.
* Suspected or known genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia.
* History of hepatitis caused by a halogenated inhalational anesthetic or unexplained fever, jaundice, leukocytosis, or eosinophilia after prior exposure to such agents.
* Situations where general anesthesia is otherwise contraindicated.


**Warnings:**

* Isoflurane can cause cardiovascular effects such as decreased blood pressure, QT prolongation (potentially leading to dangerous heart rhythms), cardiac steal (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), and reflex tachycardia.
* Reduced blood flow to the liver, kidneys, and spleen can occur.
* The risk of postoperative liver dysfunction and hepatitis exists.
* Perioperative hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood) is a possibility.
* Increased intracranial pressure may be observed.
* Respiratory depression is a dose-dependent effect.
* Use with caution in patients who are hypovolemic (low blood volume), hypotensive, hemodynamically compromised, have coronary artery disease, or are at risk of QT prolongation.

**Drug Interactions:** Isoflurane can interact with many medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effects. This includes alcohol, other CNS depressants, certain antipsychotics,  and many other medications.  Consult a healthcare professional to discuss potential interactions.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Isoflurane is classified as Category C for pregnancy, meaning that its effects on fetal development are not fully understood. It is important to weigh the risks and benefits. The excretion of isoflurane in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised for breastfeeding women.  


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for isoflurane to take effect?** A: The onset of action depends on the concentration administered and can vary, but it generally takes effect relatively quickly.

* **Q: How long does isoflurane remain in the body?** A:  Isoflurane is rapidly eliminated from the body through exhalation.  However, some effects, like cognitive impairment, may persist for a few days.

* **Q: How is isoflurane stored?** A:  Isoflurane should be stored as directed by the manufacturer, typically in a cool, dark place and away from direct sunlight.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with isoflurane?** A: While generally safe when used appropriately,  rare cases of long-term hepatic and neurological effects have been reported. It's important to follow guidelines regarding administration and monitor for any adverse reactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects after isoflurane anesthesia?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed as serious side effects.
