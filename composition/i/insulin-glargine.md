# Insulin Glargine

**Generic Name:** Insulin glargine

**Usage:**

Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analog used to treat diabetes mellitus.  It's primarily used to control blood sugar levels in adults and children with type 1 diabetes and adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's typically administered once daily at the same time each day, usually in the evening.  The dosage is individualized based on blood glucose monitoring and the patient's needs.  It's often used in combination with other insulins (such as rapid-acting insulin before meals) or oral diabetes medications to achieve optimal blood glucose control. It's not designed for treating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect. Symptoms can include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:**  These can include redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site.
* **Weight gain:**  Weight gain is a possible side effect of insulin therapy.
* **Lipohypertrophy (fat buildup):**  This can occur at the injection site with repeated injections in the same area.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but serious allergic reactions can occur. Symptoms may include hives, rash, swelling, difficulty breathing, or rapid heartbeat.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Edema (fluid retention):** Swelling in the extremities.
* **Changes in vision:** Blurred vision or other vision problems.
* **Hypokalemia (low potassium levels):** Requires monitoring.


**How it Works:**

Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analog that provides a relatively steady and predictable level of insulin in the bloodstream for up to 24 hours.  Unlike regular insulin, which acts quickly, insulin glargine has a prolonged effect, mimicking the basal insulin secretion of the pancreas.  It works by binding to insulin receptors on cells, facilitating glucose uptake from the blood into cells for energy use, thus lowering blood glucose levels.  The glargine molecule is designed to have a slower absorption rate and prolonged effect compared to other insulin types.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I mix insulin glargine with other insulins?**  Generally, insulin glargine should *not* be mixed with other insulins in the same syringe.  It's best administered separately.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Contact your doctor or diabetes care team for guidance.
* **How should I store insulin glargine?**  Store unopened vials in the refrigerator. Once opened, store at room temperature (below 86Â°F) and discard after 28 days.  Do not freeze.
* **How do I know if my insulin is still good?**  Inspect the insulin for cloudiness or discoloration.  If it looks different than usual, discard it.
* **What if I experience low blood sugar?**  Treat low blood sugar immediately with glucose tablets, sugar, or juice.  Follow your doctor's instructions for managing hypoglycemia.
* **Is insulin glargine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  It's important to discuss insulin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding with your doctor.  Dosage may need to be adjusted.
