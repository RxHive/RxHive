# Insulin Glargine
### Generic Name
Insulin Glargine

### Usage

Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analog used to improve blood sugar control in adults and children with type 1 diabetes and in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's a basal insulin, meaning it provides a continuous, steady level of insulin throughout the day to mimic the body's natural insulin production.  It is *not* used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes).  Insulin glargine is typically used in combination with faster-acting insulins (e.g., insulin lispro, aspart, or glulisine) to manage blood sugar levels before and after meals.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the type of diabetes.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following are general guidelines only and should not be used for self-dosing:

**Adults (Type 1 Diabetes):**  Initial doses are typically around 0.4-0.5 units per kilogram of body weight per day, given as a single daily subcutaneous injection. This total daily dose (TDD) is often split into basal insulin (insulin glargine) and bolus insulin (rapid-acting insulin taken before meals).  The dose needs to be adjusted based on blood sugar monitoring to find the optimal balance.

**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes):**  The starting dose might be lower, around 0.1-0.2 units per kilogram of body weight per day, or 10 units, also given as a single daily subcutaneous injection.  Again, close blood glucose monitoring is essential, and adjustments are made based on individual responses.  In patients with severe hyperglycemia, higher starting doses may be needed.

**Children (Type 1 Diabetes):**  Dosage for children with type 1 diabetes varies significantly depending on their age and weight.  Initial doses are usually lower than those for adults and are typically determined by a healthcare professional to achieve optimal glycemic control while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.  Rapid- or short-acting insulin will also be used in conjunction with the long acting insulin.

**Children (Type 2 Diabetes):**  Dosage guidelines for children with type 2 diabetes are similar to adults but may require additional adjustments under close medical supervision.

**Administration:** Insulin glargine is always administered subcutaneously (under the skin) using an injection.  Common injection sites include the abdomen, thigh, and upper arm.  Never inject intravenously.  Different formulations are available, including pre-filled pens and vials, making administration more convenient for some.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are frequently necessary. A healthcare provider will make these adjustments based on regular blood sugar monitoring, HbA1c levels, and the individual's overall response to treatment.  Changes in diet, activity levels, or illness often necessitate dose adjustments.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of insulin glargine include:

* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar): This is the most common and serious side effect and can cause symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, shakiness, confusion, and, in severe cases, loss of consciousness.
* Injection site reactions: These may include pain, redness, swelling, itching, or lipohypertrophy (fat buildup) or lipoatrophy (loss of fat tissue).
* Allergic reactions: While rare, serious allergic reactions are possible and can include hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.
* Other less common side effects:  These can include weight gain, fluid retention, and vision changes.


### How it Works

Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analog that works by binding to insulin receptors on cells, allowing glucose to enter cells for energy.  This lowers the level of glucose in the bloodstream.  Unlike rapid-acting insulins, insulin glargine is designed for gradual absorption and a prolonged effect, providing continuous basal insulin coverage.  The specific design of insulin glargine provides a flatter, more predictable blood glucose profile compared to NPH insulin.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not use if allergic to insulin glargine or any of its components.
* **Hypoglycemia:**  Insulin glargine can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), particularly if the dose is too high, if meals are missed or delayed, or if excessive exercise is undertaken.  Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to treat it.
* **Renal or hepatic impairment:**  Insulin requirements may be altered in patients with kidney or liver problems; close monitoring is essential.
* **Drug interactions:**  Several medications can interact with insulin glargine, affecting its effectiveness or increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.  Discuss all medications with a healthcare professional.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, careful monitoring of blood glucose levels is crucial.  The use of insulin glargine during pregnancy should only be determined and managed under the care of a physician.
* **Other precautions:**  Always check the insulin label before each injection, inject subcutaneously only, and rotate injection sites to prevent lipohypertrophy or lipoatrophy.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does insulin glargine last?** A: Insulin glargine provides a steady insulin level for approximately 24 hours, although its exact duration may vary slightly depending on individual factors.
* **Q: Can I mix insulin glargine with other insulins?** A: No, do not mix insulin glargine with other insulin formulations.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store insulin glargine?** A: Store unopened vials in the refrigerator. Once opened, store at room temperature and discard after 28 days.  Avoid freezing.  Keep away from direct sunlight and heat.
* **Q: What are the signs of hypoglycemia?** A:  Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.  Treatment usually involves consuming quick-acting carbohydrates like glucose tablets or juice.
* **Q: Should I avoid alcohol when using insulin glargine?** A: Alcohol can interfere with blood sugar control, increasing the risk of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.  Moderate alcohol consumption is acceptable but only under strict medical supervision and with close blood glucose monitoring.
