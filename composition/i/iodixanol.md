# Iodixanol
### Generic Name
Iodixanol

### Usage

Iodixanol is a non-ionic, iodinated contrast medium used in various medical imaging procedures. Its primary use is as a radiographic contrast agent to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and other internal structures during imaging techniques such as:

*   **Angiography:** This includes procedures like intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), angiocardiography (left ventriculography and selective coronary arteriography), cerebral arteriography, peripheral arteriography, and visceral arteriography.  These procedures help visualize blood vessels to diagnose conditions like blockages, aneurysms, or other abnormalities.

*   **Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging:** Iodixanol is used in CT scans of the head and body, and specifically in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to assess coronary arteries for disease.  The contrast agent improves the clarity of the images, aiding in the detection of problems.

*   **Excretory Urography:**  This procedure uses Iodixanol to visualize the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, helping to diagnose urinary tract issues.

*   **Peripheral Venography:**  This technique visualizes the veins in the extremities to identify venous abnormalities.


### Dosage

Iodixanol dosage varies greatly depending on the specific imaging procedure, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  It's crucial to follow the precise instructions provided by a healthcare professional for each individual case.  The following is a *general* overview and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

Dosage ranges widely from several milliliters for selective coronary arteriography to 75-150 mL bolus followed by an infusion for CT scans.  Specific dosages for various procedures are detailed in the product information. Intra-arterial or intravenous administration is common.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is weight-based and significantly lower than adult dosages.  For example, children aged 1-12 years may receive 1-2 mL/kg for certain procedures, but again, precise instructions from the healthcare provider are paramount.   The specific dosage regimen should always be determined by the physician considering the child's age, weight, and the specific imaging procedure.

**Dosage Forms:** Iodixanol is available in different concentrations (e.g., 270 mg iodine/mL, 320 mg iodine/mL) and is typically administered intravenously or intra-arterially.  The specific formulation and route of administration will be determined by the physician.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Local discomfort, pain, or warmth at the injection site
*   Headache
*   Nausea
*   Mild skin reactions (rash, itching)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

*   Anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions) â€“ This is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment.
*   Acute kidney injury
*   Cardiovascular problems (e.g., irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, heart failure)
*   Thyroid problems (especially in individuals with pre-existing thyroid conditions)
*   Seizures

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Iodixanol is a radiopaque contrast agent, meaning it absorbs X-rays differently than surrounding tissues.  When injected, it increases the density of the blood vessels or other organs being imaged, making them appear brighter and more distinct on X-ray images, CT scans, or other imaging modalities. This enhanced visibility allows radiologists to clearly visualize the targeted structures and diagnose various medical conditions.


### Precautions

*   **Allergies:** Iodixanol should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to iodine or any component of the formulation.  A history of allergies (e.g., asthma, hay fever, food allergies) may increase the risk of allergic reactions.

*   **Renal Function:** Patients with impaired kidney function are at increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (acute kidney injury).  Careful monitoring of kidney function is necessary before, during, and after the procedure.

*   **Cardiac Function:** Patients with heart disease or other cardiovascular issues should be closely monitored during and after the procedure due to the potential for cardiovascular complications.

*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While Iodixanol is classified as pregnancy category B (animal studies show no risk, human studies not available), it should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. The excretion of Iodixanol in breast milk is unknown, but generally, iodinated contrast agents are poorly excreted in breast milk. A healthcare provider should be consulted to weigh risks and benefits before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

*   **Other Medications:** Iodixanol may interact with other medications, particularly metformin (a diabetes medication). This interaction may increase the risk of lactic acidosis (a serious metabolic condition). Consult a healthcare professional about potential interactions with your current medications.

*   **Thyroid Conditions:**  Individuals with thyroid disorders should be carefully monitored, as Iodixanol might affect thyroid function.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for Iodixanol to leave my body?**  A:  Most of Iodixanol is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours.

*   **Q: Are there any special instructions for preparing for a procedure involving Iodixanol?**  A: Your doctor will provide specific instructions, but generally, proper hydration is important.

*   **Q: What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?**  A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of an allergic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).

*   **Q: Can I drive after a procedure using Iodixanol?** A:  This depends on the specific procedure and any other medications you are taking.  Follow your doctor's advice regarding driving.

*   **Q: How is Iodixanol stored?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
