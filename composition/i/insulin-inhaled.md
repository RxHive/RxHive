# Insulin Inhaled
### Generic Name
Inhaled Insulin (human)

### Usage
Inhaled insulin (human) is a rapid-acting insulin used to improve blood sugar (glycemic) control in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's primarily used as a mealtime (prandial) insulin to help manage blood sugar spikes after eating.  It is *not* suitable for treating diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes) and should not be used by people who currently smoke or have recently quit smoking.  It's important to note that inhaled insulin is not a replacement for long-acting insulin and may need to be used in conjunction with other types of insulin, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Dosage

**Adults (Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):** Inhaled insulin is administered via oral inhalation.  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's current blood sugar levels, meal patterns, activity levels, and overall health.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate starting dose and adjust it as needed.

* **Initiation in Insulin-Naive Patients:** The starting dose is typically 4 units with each meal.
* **Conversion from Subcutaneous (Injected) Mealtime Insulin:**  The conversion from injected mealtime insulin to inhaled insulin involves calculating an equivalent dose. This calculation is best performed with the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Conversion from Subcutaneous Premixed Insulin:**  Converting from premixed insulin to inhaled insulin involves estimating the mealtime portion of the injected dose and converting it to the inhaled equivalent.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate basal (long-acting) insulin to be injected separately.
* **Dosage Adjustment:** The dose may need to be adjusted based on blood sugar levels, changes in diet, exercise, or other medical conditions.  Close monitoring of blood sugar levels is crucial.  If blood sugar control remains inadequate even with dose increases, the healthcare provider might recommend supplementing with subcutaneous (injected) mealtime insulin.


**Children:** Inhaled insulin hasn't been studied in children under 18 years of age and is therefore not recommended for this age group.

**Dosage Forms:** Inhaled insulin is typically available as a pre-filled cartridge designed for use with a specific inhaler device.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar): This is a common and potentially serious side effect. Symptoms can include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.
* Cough
* Acute bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)
* Throat irritation


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe hypoglycemia
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
*  Development of antibodies against insulin (though usually without impacting efficacy)
*  Diabetic ketoacidosis (in type 1 diabetes)
*  Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
*  Reduced lung function
*  Weight gain

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Inhaled insulin works by mimicking the action of naturally occurring insulin. It lowers blood sugar levels by:

* **Increasing glucose uptake:**  It helps cells in muscles and fat tissue absorb glucose from the bloodstream.
* **Decreasing glucose production:** It reduces the liver's production of glucose.
* **Inhibiting lipolysis:** It reduces the breakdown of fats.
* **Promoting protein synthesis:** It supports the building of proteins in the body.

Inhaled insulin provides a rapid onset of action, making it effective for managing post-meal blood sugar spikes.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Inhaled insulin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to insulin or any formulation components, during episodes of hypoglycemia, and in those with chronic lung diseases like asthma or COPD.
* **Interactions:** Numerous medications can interact with inhaled insulin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness, and altering the risk of hypoglycemia.  This includes many commonly prescribed medications, like antidiabetic agents, beta-blockers, corticosteroids, and others.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  There is a boxed warning about the risk of acute bronchospasm (sudden airway narrowing) in patients with chronic lung disease.  Before starting treatment, a thorough medical history, physical exam, and pulmonary function tests are crucial to identify any underlying lung issues.  Inhaled insulin should not be used by smokers or recent ex-smokers.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Inhaled insulin is a category C medication in pregnancy.  Alternatives to inhaled insulin are generally preferred during pregnancy. It's excreted in breast milk, and the decision to breastfeed while using inhaled insulin should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.  
* **Special Populations:**  People with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment may require dose adjustments and increased monitoring.  Older adults and individuals with a history of hypoglycemia may also need careful management.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for inhaled insulin to start working?**
A: Inhaled insulin is a rapid-acting insulin with a relatively quick onset of action, usually within 15-30 minutes.

**Q: How should I store inhaled insulin?**
A: Store inhaled insulin cartridges according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature.  Do not freeze.

**Q: Can I use inhaled insulin if I have asthma or COPD?**
A: No, inhaled insulin is contraindicated in people with asthma or COPD due to a significantly increased risk of acute bronchospasm.

**Q: What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?**
A: If you experience symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), immediately consume a source of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as glucose tablets or juice.  Monitor your blood sugar and seek medical attention if necessary.

**Q: Is inhaled insulin right for everyone with diabetes?**
A: No, inhaled insulin is not suitable for everyone with diabetes.  Your healthcare provider will determine if it's the appropriate treatment option based on your individual needs and health status.  Specific contraindications exist, and careful consideration should be given to risk factors like lung disease or smoking.
