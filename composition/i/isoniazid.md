# Isoniazid
### Generic Name
Isoniazid

### Usage

Isoniazid (INH), an antibiotic, primarily combats tuberculosis (TB) caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  It's used in two key ways:

* **Treatment of active TB:** Isoniazid is crucial in treating active TB infections, but it's *always* administered in combination with other anti-TB drugs. This combination therapy is essential for effective treatment and to prevent the development of drug resistance.

* **Treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI):**  Many individuals carry the TB bacteria without showing symptoms (LTBI). Isoniazid can prevent this latent infection from progressing into active disease.  In this case, it may be used as a monotherapy or in combination with other medications, depending on individual factors and guidelines.  In some cases, it may be used off-label to treat infections caused by other mycobacteria like *M. kansasii*, usually in combination with other drugs.

### Dosage

Isoniazid dosage varies significantly depending on the type of TB (active or latent), the treatment regimen (daily, twice-weekly, thrice-weekly, etc.), the patient's weight and age, and their overall health status (e.g., presence of HIV, liver disease, or renal impairment).  Dosage forms include tablets and injections (intramuscular). It's vital to follow the prescribed regimen precisely and seek professional guidance for any adjustments.

**Adult Dosage (Active TB):**  Dosage ranges from 5mg/kg/day to 15mg/kg/dose administered 3 times weekly depending on the chosen treatment regimen and clinical setting.  The maximum daily dose is usually 900mg.  Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) is often used to ensure adherence. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is usually co-administered to reduce the risk of nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy).

**Adult Dosage (Latent TB):** This typically involves a lower dose (e.g., 300mg daily) given for a shorter duration (6-9 months) or as a 12-week course with rifapentine.  

**Pediatric Dosage:** Pediatric dosages are based on weight (mg/kg) and are considerably lower than adult dosages.  Regimens again vary depending on the type of TB and treatment strategy.  Always consult a healthcare professional for accurate pediatric dosing.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be needed for patients with liver or kidney problems.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women require careful monitoring and specific dosing adjustments.  Consult your doctor for guidance in these instances.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness in extremities)

Less common but serious side effects:

* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Seizures
* Psychosis
* Blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)


If any side effect occurs, particularly those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Isoniazid interferes with the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* cell wall. This disruption leads to the death of the bacteria.  It's most effective against actively growing bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Isoniazid is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, severe liver disease (including active hepatitis), or a history of isoniazid-induced hepatitis.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Isoniazid can interact with several medications, including some anti-epileptics, anticoagulants, and certain other antibiotics.  Inform your doctor about all medications you're taking before starting isoniazid.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking isoniazid, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Isoniazid can cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. It should be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Close monitoring is essential.
* **Monitoring:** Regular liver function tests and blood counts are usually recommended during isoniazid treatment to detect potential adverse effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew Isoniazid tablets?** A:  Generally, tablets should be swallowed whole. Consult your pharmacist or physician if you have difficulty swallowing tablets.

* **Q: How should I store Isoniazid?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.  If frequent doses are missed, consult your physician.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the type of TB and the treatment regimen.  It's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment, even if symptoms improve.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while on Isoniazid?** A: No. Alcohol should be strictly avoided because it significantly increases the risk of liver damage.
