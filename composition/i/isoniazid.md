# Isoniazid

**Generic Name:** Isoniazid (INH)

**Usage:** Isoniazid is an antibiotic used primarily to treat and prevent tuberculosis (TB). It's almost always used in combination with other anti-TB drugs.  It's also sometimes used to treat other mycobacterial infections.  The specific regimen (dosage and duration) depends on the type of TB (latent or active), the patient's health status, and other factors determined by a physician.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary in severity. Common side effects include:

* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Tingling, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet. This is often preventable or manageable with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  This is a more serious side effect, particularly in individuals with pre-existing liver conditions or those consuming alcohol. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Regular liver function tests are crucial during treatment.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Dizziness and headache:** These can occur but are usually mild.
* **Drug fever:**  A fever that develops as a reaction to the drug.
* **Rash:**  A skin rash is possible, and can indicate a more serious allergic reaction.


**How it Works:** Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential components of the cell wall of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. By interfering with cell wall synthesis, isoniazid prevents the bacteria from growing and reproducing.  It's most effective against actively growing *M. tuberculosis*.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take isoniazid with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as some can interact with isoniazid.  This is especially important with drugs metabolized by the liver.
* **Q: How long do I need to take isoniazid?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the type and severity of the infection and is determined by a physician.  Treatment for latent TB might last several months, while active TB often requires treatment for much longer.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those related to liver function or peripheral neuropathy.  Do not stop taking isoniazid without consulting your doctor.
* **Q: Is isoniazid safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: The risks and benefits of isoniazid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding need to be carefully weighed by a healthcare professional.  The potential benefits of treating TB often outweigh the risks to the fetus or infant, but close monitoring is necessary.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking isoniazid?** A: Alcohol consumption should be avoided or significantly limited while taking isoniazid, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.
* **Q: Are there any drug interactions with Isoniazid?** A: Yes, several drug interactions exist. Some examples include interactions with certain anticonvulsants (like phenytoin), rifampin (another TB drug) and certain antidepressants. Your doctor should be aware of all other medications you are taking.
