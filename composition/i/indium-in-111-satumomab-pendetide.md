# Indium (In 111) Satumomab Pendetide
### Generic Name
Indium (In 111) Satumomab Pendetide

### Usage
Indium (In 111) satumomab pendetide, also known as satumomab pendetide, is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily for imaging, specifically to detect the location and extent of colorectal and ovarian cancers that have spread beyond the primary tumor site (metastatic disease).  It's a monoclonal antibody that targets a specific protein, TAG-72, often found on the surface of cancer cells.  While it was once used to help diagnose these cancers, it is no longer commercially available.  Its use was mainly in determining the spread of known colorectal or ovarian cancers.


### Dosage
Because Indium (In 111) satumomab pendetide is no longer commercially available, specific dosage information is not readily provided here.  Dosage would have been determined by a physician based on factors such as the patient's weight, the type and extent of the cancer, and other relevant medical factors. The medication would have been administered intravenously (by injection into a vein).


### Side Effects
While generally well-tolerated, side effects associated with Indium (In 111) satumomab pendetide could include:

* Mild allergic reactions (rash, itching)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Bone marrow suppression (a serious side effect, though rare)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Indium (In 111) satumomab pendetide works by combining a monoclonal antibody (satumomab pendetide) that specifically binds to TAG-72, a protein often found on the surface of cancerous cells, with a radioactive isotope, Indium-111.  The antibody acts like a homing device, targeting and attaching to cancer cells expressing TAG-72. The Indium-111 then emits gamma rays, which can be detected by a special imaging scanner (gamma camera). This allows doctors to visualize the location and size of the cancer, helping to determine the extent of the disease.


### Precautions
Because Indium (In 111) satumomab pendetide is no longer available, specific precautions are not detailed here. However, it's important to note that as a radioactive substance and a biological agent, it would have had precautions, particularly for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  Patients with known allergies to mouse proteins would also have been at risk of allergic reactions.  Any potential drug interactions would have needed to be considered and assessed by a physician prior to administration.


### FAQs

**Q: Is Indium (In 111) satumomab pendetide still available?**

A: No, it is no longer commercially available.

**Q: What are the alternatives to this medication for cancer imaging?**

A:  Several other imaging techniques and radiopharmaceuticals are currently used for detecting and staging cancers, including  CT scans, MRI, PET scans, and other radiolabeled antibodies.  A doctor can determine the most appropriate approach based on the individual's condition.

**Q: What if I experienced side effects from this medication in the past?**

A: If you experienced side effects from Indium (In 111) satumomab pendetide in the past, it's crucial to inform your doctor about your experience if you are undergoing other cancer treatments involving imaging or medications.
