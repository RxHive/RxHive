# Isoprenaline [Isoproterenol]
### Generic Name
Isoprenaline (Isoproterenol)

### Usage
Isoprenaline is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist primarily used for the treatment of transient episodes of heart block not requiring a pacemaker or electric shock.  It's also indicated for severe heart block and Adams-Stokes attacks (excluding those caused by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation), cardiac arrest (as a temporary measure before more definitive treatments), and bronchospasm occurring during anesthesia.  Secondary uses include adjunctive therapy in hypovolemic and septic shock, low cardiac output states, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock, alongside fluid and electrolyte replacement and other treatments.  It has also seen off-label use in managing Brugada syndrome with electrical storms and refractory torsade de pointes.  However, it's important to note that isoprenaline is not the first-line treatment for many of these conditions due to potential risks.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration, and the patient's age and weight.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's instructions precisely.  Below are examples and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical guidance:

**Adults:**

* **Adams-Stokes attack, complete heart block, cardiac arrest:**  IV bolus (0.02-0.06 mg initially, followed by 0.01-0.2 mg as needed); IV infusion (5 mcg/min initially, titrated to 2-20 mcg/min); IM (0.2 mg initially, followed by 0.02-1 mg as needed); Subcutaneous (0.2 mg initially, followed by 0.15-0.2 mg as needed); Intracardiac (0.02 mg).
* **Bradyarrhythmia, AV nodal block:** IV infusion (2-10 mcg/min, titrated to response).
* **Postoperative cardiac bradycardia:** IV infusion (2-10 mcg/min); IM (0.2 mg initially, 0.02-1 mg as needed); Subcutaneous (0.2 mg initially, 0.15-0.2 mg as needed).
* **Shock, hypoperfusion:** IV infusion (0.5-5 mcg/min, higher rates may be used in advanced stages, but specific limitations apply to septic shock).
* **Bronchospasm:** IV bolus (0.01-0.02 mg as needed); Sublingual (10-20 mg every 3-4 hours, max 60 mg/day); Inhalation (metered-dose: 1-2 doses 4-6 times/day; nebulizer: dosage depends on concentration and device used).


**Children:** Dosage is typically calculated based on weight in mcg/kg/min for conditions like Adams-Stokes attacks, complete heart block, cardiac arrest, and bradyarrhythmias.  Specific dosages for bronchospasm may also be weight-based.  Precise pediatric dosages must be determined by a healthcare professional.  

**Note:**  The information above represents a sampling of potential dosages.  Consult a physician or pharmacist for precise guidance based on individual needs.  Improper dosage can be dangerous.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nervousness
* Restlessness
* Palpitations
* Tremor
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Flushing
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Adams-Stokes syndrome
* Angina pectoris
* Hypertension or hypotension
* Tachyarrhythmias
* Ventricular arrhythmias
* Pulmonary edema
* Paradoxical bradycardia
* Hypokalemia
* Increased blood glucose
* Seizures

Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.


### How it Works
Isoprenaline stimulates both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors.  Beta-1 stimulation increases heart rate and contractility, while beta-2 stimulation causes relaxation of smooth muscles in the bronchi, gastrointestinal tract, and uterus.  This mechanism leads to improved cardiac output and bronchodilation, addressing the symptoms of heart block, cardiac arrest, and bronchospasm. The vasodilation of peripheral blood vessels can also improve tissue perfusion in shock states.

### Precautions
Isoprenaline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, angina pectoris, pre-existing cardiac arrhythmias (especially ventricular arrhythmias requiring inotropic therapy), and cardiac glycoside intoxication.

Use with extreme caution in patients with:

* Cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, hypertension, etc.)
* Distributive shock, post-myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock
* Seizures
* Diabetes mellitus
* Hyperthyroidism
* Elderly patients
* Patients anesthetized with inhalational anesthetics

Isoprenaline can interact with other medications, such as beta-blockers (which counteract its effects), COMT inhibitors (which may alter its metabolism), ergot alkaloids, theophylline derivatives, and certain MAO inhibitors.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.  The use of isoprenaline during pregnancy or breastfeeding requires careful consideration due to potential risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store isoprenaline?**  A: Store according to the instructions on the product label, typically at a controlled room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I stop taking isoprenaline suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking isoprenaline without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation may worsen your condition.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q:  Is isoprenaline safe for everyone?** A: No, isoprenaline has several contraindications and precautions.  Its use is risky for many people, and it should only be used under the strict supervision of a healthcare provider.

* **Q:  Are there alternative treatments for the conditions isoprenaline treats?** A: Yes, there are many other, often safer and more effective treatments for conditions such as heart block, cardiac arrest, and bronchospasm.  Isoprenaline is generally a last resort or temporary measure.
