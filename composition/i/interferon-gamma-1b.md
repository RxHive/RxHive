# Interferon Gamma-1b
### Generic Name
Interferon Gamma-1b

### Usage

Interferon gamma-1b is primarily used to reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).  CGD is a rare genetic disorder affecting the immune system's ability to fight certain bacteria and fungi.  This medication helps bolster the immune response against these pathogens.

Additionally, Interferon gamma-1b is used to slow the progression of severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO). SMO is a rare and severe bone disease characterized by abnormally dense bones, leading to various health complications.  The medication's action in SMO isn't fully understood but is believed to affect bone marrow function and bone resorption.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage is expressed in micrograms (mcg); 50 mcg is equivalent to 1 million units.  Monitoring of blood counts, blood chemistry, and urine tests is crucial before starting treatment and every three months thereafter.

**Adults and Children (both for CGD and SMO):**  The subcutaneous (SubQ) injection dosage is determined by body surface area (BSA):

* **BSA ≤ 0.5 m²:** 1.5 mcg/kg/dose three times weekly; maximum dose 50 mcg/m².
* **BSA > 0.5 m²:** 50 mcg/m² (1 million units/m²) three times weekly; maximum dose 50 mcg/m².

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, drug accumulation is possible in patients with advanced liver or severe kidney disease.  If significant liver enzyme elevations occur, the dose should be reduced or treatment interrupted until the elevation subsides.  For severe reactions of any kind, the dose may be reduced by 50% or treatment paused until the adverse reaction improves.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Fever
* Headache
* Chills
* Fatigue
* Rash
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Injection site erythema (redness) or tenderness

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**

* Depression
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Elevated alkaline phosphatase (liver enzyme)
* Atopic dermatitis
* Granulomatous colitis
* Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Interferon gamma-1b is a cytokine, a type of protein that plays a crucial role in immune regulation. It primarily works by enhancing the ability of macrophages (a type of immune cell) to kill bacteria and fungi through increased oxidative metabolism. It also enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), activates natural killer cells, and influences the expression of Fc receptors and major histocompatibility antigens—all contributing to a stronger immune response against infection.  In SMO, its mechanism is less fully understood but involves actions on bone marrow function and bone resorption.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Interferon gamma-1b is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to interferon gamma, *Escherichia coli*-derived products, or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with:

* Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (ischemia, heart failure, arrhythmias)
* Myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression)
* History of seizure disorder or compromised CNS function

Increased risks include bone marrow suppression, central nervous system (CNS) effects (decreased mental status, gait disturbance, dizziness), flu-like symptoms, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), hypersensitivity reactions, and renal toxicity (kidney damage).  The medication may also exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions.  The vial stopper contains natural rubber (latex derivative), which may cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Interferon gamma-1b is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  It is unknown whether this medication is excreted in breast milk.  A decision about whether to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug must be made carefully, considering the benefits of treatment for the mother.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Interferon gamma-1b administered?** A: It's administered via subcutaneous injection into the deltoid or anterior thigh.  Premedication with acetaminophen and/or bedtime administration may help minimize flu-like symptoms.

* **Q: Can I mix Interferon gamma-1b with other medications in the same syringe?** A: No, do not mix it with other medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.  They may adjust your dosage or recommend other measures.

* **Q: How should I store Interferon gamma-1b?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.

* **Q: Are there any specific instructions for driving or operating machinery?** A:  Patients should exercise caution when driving or operating machinery, especially if they experience fatigue, confusion, disorientation, or hallucinations. Alcohol may worsen these effects.
