# Ibuprofen + Paracetamol + Magnesium Trisilicate

**Generic Name:** Ibuprofen + Paracetamol + Magnesium Trisilicate (various brand names exist)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used for the relief of:

* **Pain:**  Mild to moderate pain such as headaches, toothaches, muscular aches, menstrual cramps, and back pain.
* **Inflammation:**  Reduces inflammation associated with pain.  Ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory action is stronger than paracetamol's.
* **Fever:** Reduces fever. Paracetamol is primarily responsible for this effect.
* **Heartburn/Indigestion:** Magnesium trisilicate neutralizes stomach acid, providing relief from heartburn and indigestion.  This is particularly helpful if the pain is exacerbated by stomach acid.

**It's crucial to note:** This combination is not suitable for all types of pain or fever.  For severe pain or persistent fever, consult a doctor.  This medication should not be used long-term without medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhoea.  Magnesium trisilicate can cause constipation.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).
* **Other:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache.
* **Ibuprofen-specific:**  At higher doses or with prolonged use, ibuprofen can cause stomach ulcers and bleeding.
* **Paracetamol-specific:**  High doses of paracetamol can cause liver damage.

**How it Works:**

* **Ibuprofen:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and mild to moderate pain through a mechanism not fully understood, but thought to involve affecting prostaglandin production in the central nervous system.
* **Magnesium Trisilicate:** An antacid that neutralizes stomach acid, providing relief from heartburn and indigestion by chemically reacting with the acid.
