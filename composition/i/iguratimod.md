# Iguratimod

**Generic Name:** Iguratimod

**Usage:** Iguratimod is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults, particularly those who have had an inadequate response to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  It's often used as an add-on therapy to methotrexate or other DMARDs.  It is not a first-line treatment for RA.  It's important to note that its availability varies significantly by country.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, iguratimod can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
* **Liver abnormalities:** Elevated liver enzymes (this requires monitoring through blood tests).
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching.
* **Headache:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Infection:**  Increased susceptibility to infections is possible.


Serious, though less common, side effects may include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These are rare but can be life-threatening.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or hives.
* **Blood disorders:**  Changes in blood counts.
* **Severe liver damage:** This is rare but serious and requires immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**  The exact mechanism of action of iguratimod isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by modulating the immune system. It's thought to suppress the activity of certain immune cells, like T cells and macrophages, that contribute to the inflammation and joint damage characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis.  Specifically, it's believed to interfere with cytokine production and reduce the release of inflammatory mediators.  It's considered a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
