# Norethindrone/ Norethisterone
### Generic Name
Norethindrone/Norethisterone

### Usage

Norethindrone, also known as norethisterone, is a synthetic hormone belonging to the progestin family.  Its primary use is as a contraceptive, preventing pregnancy.  It works differently than combination birth control pills (containing both estrogen and progestin); norethindrone is a progestin-only option.  

Beyond contraception, norethindrone also finds use in treating several conditions related to hormonal imbalances:

* **Secondary Amenorrhea:**  This refers to the absence of menstruation in women who have previously menstruated. Norethindrone can help induce withdrawal bleeding, providing diagnostic and therapeutic benefit.

* **Endometriosis:**  This condition involves the growth of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus. Norethindrone helps manage endometriosis symptoms by suppressing the growth of this tissue and reducing pain.

* **Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB):**  Norethindrone is used to treat AUB caused by hormonal irregularities, provided there's no underlying organic cause like fibroids or cancer. It helps regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce excessive bleeding.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the specific formulation of norethindrone (e.g., norethindrone acetate).  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions carefully.  The information below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Contraception:**  The typical dose is one 0.35 mg tablet daily, taken at the same time each day.  Missed pills should be taken as soon as possible, and a backup contraceptive method should be used for 48 hours if a pill is missed by more than 3 hours.

**Abnormal Uterine Bleeding and Amenorrhea:** Dosages range from 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day for 5-10 days (norethindrone acetate) or 5 mg three times a day for 10 days (norethindrone).  The exact regimen is determined by the physician.

**Endometriosis:**  Treatment usually involves 5 mg daily for 14 days (norethindrone acetate),  with the dose potentially adjusted upwards under medical supervision.  Treatment typically lasts for 6-9 months. Alternative regimens using norethindrone tablets also exist and are determined based on individual needs and response.

**Pediatric Use:** Norethindrone is not recommended for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headaches
* Nausea
* Mood changes (including depression)
* Breast tenderness
* Weight changes
* Spotting or irregular bleeding (especially common initially)
* Acne

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can include:

* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke)
* Liver problems
* High blood pressure
* Allergic reactions

If you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Norethindrone is a progestin, a type of hormone that plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle.  Its primary mechanism of action in contraception involves suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). It also thickens cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg, and alters the uterine lining (endometrium), making implantation less likely.  In the treatment of conditions like endometriosis and AUB, norethindrone exerts its effects by reducing the growth and activity of endometrial tissue.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Norethindrone is contraindicated during pregnancy and is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Norethindrone is excreted in breast milk, so use during breastfeeding should be approached cautiously and only under a doctor's guidance.
* **Liver Disease:**  Norethindrone should be avoided in women with liver disease or a history of liver tumors.
* **Blood Clots:**  Women with a history of blood clots or a family history of blood clots should discuss the risks with their doctor before taking norethindrone.
* **Other Medications:**  Norethindrone can interact with certain medications, so it's essential to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Smoking:**  Smoking significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular problems in women taking hormonal contraceptives like norethindrone.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take norethindrone if I have diabetes?** A:  Use with caution; discuss this with your doctor as diabetes can influence your risk profile.

* **Q: How should I store norethindrone?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a pill?** A: Take it as soon as you remember. Use a backup method of contraception for 48 hours if the pill is missed by more than 3 hours.

* **Q: Does norethindrone protect against STIs?** A: No, norethindrone does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.  Use barrier methods like condoms for STI protection.

* **Q: Can I stop taking norethindrone suddenly?** A:  It's best to follow your doctor's advice on stopping the medication.  Sudden cessation can sometimes lead to irregular bleeding.
