# Niflumic Acid
### Generic Name
Niflumic Acid

### Usage
Niflumic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to reduce inflammation and pain associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders.  Its main applications include treating inflammation, providing symptomatic relief in various conditions, and managing acute gouty arthritis.  It's also used for acute musculoskeletal disorders like tendinitis, bursitis, and periarthritis, as well as soft tissue injuries and osteoarthritis exacerbations.  While primarily an oral medication, topical formulations (creams and gels) are available for localized pain and inflammation.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the condition and route of administration.

* **Oral (Inflammation, symptomatic treatment):**  A loading dose of 250 mg three or four times daily (TID or QID) is often used, followed by adjustment based on individual response and tolerance. The lowest effective dose should always be used. The maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.

* **Oral (Acute gouty arthritis):** A loading dose of 500 mg is typically given, followed by 250 mg after 2-4 hours.  Maintenance dosing is then 250 mg TID or QID.

* **Topical (Acute musculoskeletal disorders, soft tissue injuries, osteoarthritis exacerbations):**  Creams (3%) or gels (2.5%) are applied to the affected area two or three times daily (BID or TID), using 5-10 cm of the cream or gel per application.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of niflumic acid in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided by the manufacturer for hepatic or renal impairment. However, caution is advised when using niflumic acid in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Epigastric pain
* Dyspepsia
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin reactions (including photosensitivity and, rarely, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)

Less common but serious side effects can include:

* Agranulocytosis (severe decrease in white blood cells)
* Neutropenia (decrease in a type of white blood cell)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Niflumic acid is a fenamate-derived NSAID. It works primarily by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory substances in the body.  By reducing prostaglandin synthesis, niflumic acid decreases inflammation, pain, and fever.  This mechanism of action is similar to other NSAIDs, but niflumic acid possesses its own unique pharmacological profile.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Niflumic acid is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to niflumic acid, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), or other NSAIDs; active gastric or duodenal ulcers or active gastrointestinal bleeding; and severe heart failure.

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients with a history of upper GI tract disease, hemorrhagic disorders, impaired renal or liver function, compromised cardiac function, asthma, infections, edema, or elderly patients are at increased risk of adverse effects and should use niflumic acid with caution.

* **Drug Interactions:** Niflumic acid can interact with various medications, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, other NSAIDs, salicylates, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, digoxin, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium. These interactions can increase the risk of bleeding, affect blood pressure control, reduce the effectiveness of other medications, or increase the risk of toxicity. Careful monitoring is necessary when niflumic acid is used concurrently with these medications.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Use during the last trimester of pregnancy can cause fetal and neonatal adverse effects, particularly renal failure.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Consult with your doctor before using niflumic acid if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take niflumic acid with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all the medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before starting niflumic acid. Several interactions are possible.

* **Q: How should I store niflumic acid?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is niflumic acid safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use requires careful monitoring by your doctor due to the potential for serious side effects. Regular blood tests may be necessary.

* **Q: Can I stop taking niflumic acid suddenly?** A:  You should never stop taking niflumic acid abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Gradual tapering off might be necessary to minimize potential withdrawal or rebound effects.
