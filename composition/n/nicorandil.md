# Nicorandil
### Generic Name
Nicorandil

### Usage
Nicorandil is primarily used to treat chronic stable angina, a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.  It's prescribed when other first-line treatments like beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers haven't been effective, or if those medications are unsuitable for the patient. Nicorandil is also used in the management of acute heart failure (including when chronic heart failure suddenly worsens) and unstable angina (a more serious form of chest pain indicating a potential heart attack).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Chronic Stable Angina (Oral):**  The starting dose is typically 5-10 mg twice daily (morning and evening) or 5 mg three times daily.  Depending on response and tolerance, the doctor may increase this to 10-20 mg twice daily, up to a maximum of 40 mg twice daily.

* **Acute Heart Failure (Intravenous):**  The initial dose is 0.2 mg/kg given as a single dose over approximately 5 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/hour. The infusion rate is adjusted based on the patient's response and blood pressure (the range is 0.05-0.2 mg/kg/hour). A solution of 0.04-0.25% is typically used.

* **Unstable Angina (Intravenous):**  The starting dose is 2 mg/hour as a continuous infusion using a 0.01-0.03% solution. The maximum dose is 6 mg/hour.  Adjustments are made based on response.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of nicorandil in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is usually needed for oral nicorandil in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, for intravenous administration, caution is advised in mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment, and it is contraindicated in severe impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Lethargy
* Vertigo
* Palpitations
* Facial flushing
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anorexia
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Skin rash


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)

If you experience any of these side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical assistance.

### How it Works
Nicorandil works through a dual mechanism of action. At lower doses, it acts as a nitrate, relaxing blood vessels (vasodilation) and improving blood flow, particularly in the coronary arteries supplying the heart.  At higher doses, it activates potassium channels in the blood vessels, further enhancing vasodilation and reducing blood pressure.  This combined effect reduces the workload on the heart, relieving angina pain and improving symptoms in heart failure.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nicorandil is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, severe hepatic or renal impairment (for intravenous administration), shock (including cardiogenic shock), severe hypotension, left ventricular dysfunction with low filling pressure or cardiac decompensation, hypovolemia (low blood volume), acute pulmonary edema,  and concurrent use with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors or guanylate cyclase stimulators (e.g., riociguat).

* **Interactions:** Nicorandil can enhance the hypotensive effects of other antihypertensives, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, and alcohol.

* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), aortic stenosis, closed-angle glaucoma, hepatic or renal impairment, acute pulmonary edema, G6PD deficiency, hypovolemia, low systolic blood pressure, the elderly, and those with diverticular disease. It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take nicorandil with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications may interact negatively with nicorandil.

* **Q: How should I store nicorandil?** A: Store nicorandil as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nicorandil suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping nicorandil can be harmful.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or altering your medication regimen.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking nicorandil?** A:  Itâ€™s best to avoid alcohol while taking nicorandil as it may increase the risk of hypotension.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of taking nicorandil?** A: Long-term effects should be discussed with your physician. Regular monitoring and checkups are crucial for assessing your overall health and response to treatment.
