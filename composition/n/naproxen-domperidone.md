# Naproxen + Domperidone
### Generic Name
Naproxen + Domperidone

**Note:**  Naproxen + Domperidone is a combination drug. It's crucial to understand that this information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting or changing any medication.  The specific formulation (dosage, form, etc.) will vary depending on the brand and country of origin.  This information is based on common formulations and uses.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders, particularly those involving pain and nausea.  Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), targets pain and inflammation. Domperidone, a prokinetic agent, helps relieve nausea and vomiting by increasing the movement of the stomach contents.  The combination is often prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Dyspepsia (indigestion):**  Characterized by upper abdominal discomfort, pain, bloating, and nausea.
* **Gastritis:** Inflammation of the stomach lining, often causing pain and nausea.
* **Peptic ulcers (in some cases):** While not a first-line treatment, it may be used to manage symptoms in certain situations under strict medical supervision.
* **Post-operative nausea and vomiting:**  To alleviate nausea and vomiting following surgical procedures.


It's important to note that this combination is *not* a treatment for the underlying causes of these conditions. It primarily addresses the symptoms.  A doctor will determine the appropriate underlying treatment if needed.


### Dosage

Dosage will be determined by your physician based on your individual needs and medical history.  There is no standardized "one-size-fits-all" dosage for Naproxen + Domperidone.  The combination is typically available in tablet form.  

* **Adults:**  The dosage varies widely depending on the specific formulation. It's crucial to follow the prescription instructions carefully.
* **Children:**  This combination is generally not recommended for children.  Naproxen and Domperidone have separate pediatric formulations, but the combination itself is typically not used for children.  Always follow a doctor's prescription for any pediatric medication.
* **IV Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously.  Naproxen and Domperidone are often administered separately if IV medication is needed.


**Important:** Never adjust the dosage on your own.  Always adhere to the prescribed dosage and instructions provided by your healthcare professional.

If you experience any serious or persistent side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Naproxen reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.  Domperidone enhances the motility of the gastrointestinal tract, helping to move food through the stomach and intestines more efficiently. This accelerates the emptying of the stomach, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting.


### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Naproxen and domperidone can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners, certain antidepressants, and other NSAIDs. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor.  The benefits must outweigh potential risks.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults are more susceptible to side effects, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney problems.
* **Patients with Liver or Kidney Disease:**  The combination should be used with caution in individuals with liver or kidney disease.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
