# Niraparib
### Generic Name
Niraparib

### Usage
Niraparib is a type of cancer medication called a PARP inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating certain types of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers.  Specifically, it's used in two main situations:

1. **First-line maintenance treatment:**  For adults with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have had a complete or partial response to their initial platinum-based chemotherapy.  This means the cancer has shrunk or disappeared after the first treatment, and Niraparib helps to prevent it from returning.

2. **Maintenance treatment in recurrent cancer:** For adults with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have responded (either completely or partially) to platinum-based chemotherapy.  It helps keep the cancer from coming back after treatment.

3. **Treatment after multiple prior therapies:**  Niraparib is also used to treat adults with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back after at least three prior chemotherapy regimens. This usage is specific to cancers that test positive for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), often indicated by a BRCA mutation or genomic instability. The cancer must have progressed more than six months after its last response to platinum-based chemotherapy.


### Dosage

Niraparib is typically taken orally (by mouth) once daily. The exact dosage depends on several factors, primarily the patient's weight and platelet count (a type of blood cell).  Dosage information below is for adults only; pediatric safety and efficacy haven't been established.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

* **First-line maintenance treatment:**
    * For those weighing less than 77 kg (170 lbs) or with a platelet count below 150,000/mcL: 200 mg once daily.
    * For those weighing 77 kg (170 lbs) or more and with a platelet count of 150,000/mcL or more: 300 mg once daily.
    * Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  Treatment should start within 12 weeks of the last platinum-containing regimen.

* **Recurrent cancer maintenance treatment:**
    *  The dosage typically ranges from 200 to 300 mg once daily. It continues until disease progression or intolerable side effects. Treatment should begin within 8 weeks of the most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.

* **Treatment after three or more prior chemotherapy regimens:**
    * Typically 300 mg once daily, or 200-300mg, depending on patient-specific factors. This is used only in patients with HRD-positive cancers.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on liver or kidney function, and in cases of side effects.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for any dosage changes.  Specific guidance on dose reductions for various side effects (particularly hematologic toxicities) is crucial and should be obtained from a physician or pharmacist.

### Side Effects

Niraparib, like many cancer medications, can cause side effects.  The following are some of the more common side effects:

* **Common (affecting more than 10% of patients):** Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, decreased appetite, headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, anemia, low white blood cell count (leukopenia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), high blood pressure, cough, shortness of breath.

* **Less Common (affecting 1-10% of patients):** Depression, palpitations, peripheral edema, skin rash, increased liver enzymes.

* **Serious but Less Common:**  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML),  posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES),  hypertensive crisis, allergic reactions.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Niraparib is a PARP inhibitor. PARP enzymes are involved in DNA repair within cells. By blocking these enzymes, Niraparib prevents cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, leading to cell death. This effect is particularly pronounced in cancer cells with defects in their own DNA repair mechanisms (such as those with BRCA mutations), making Niraparib particularly effective in these cases.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Niraparib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to niraparib or any of its components.  Breastfeeding women should also avoid this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:** While no significant interactions are currently listed, it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal remedies) you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Niraparib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least six months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one month after the final dose.

* **Other Precautions:**  Niraparib can suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts.  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor this. Patients with liver or kidney impairment may require dosage adjustments.  Close monitoring for high blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues is essential.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Niraparib with food?** A: Yes, Niraparib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the next dose at the regular scheduled time; do not double the dose.
