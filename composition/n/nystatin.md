# Nystatin
### Generic Name
Nystatin

### Usage
Nystatin is an antifungal medication used to treat a variety of fungal infections, primarily those caused by *Candida* species.  Its main applications include:

* **Oral thrush (oral candidiasis):** This is a common infection affecting the mouth and throat, characterized by white patches and soreness. Nystatin is a first-line treatment for oral thrush in both adults and children.
* **Gastrointestinal candidiasis:**  Nystatin can treat candidal infections of the esophagus and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, though other antifungals might be preferred for esophageal candidiasis.
* **Cutaneous and mucocutaneous candidiasis:** This encompasses fungal skin infections, such as diaper rash in infants (though efficacy isn't fully established in this case), and yeast infections of the skin folds and mucous membranes. Nystatin is typically applied topically for these conditions.
* **Vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection):** Nystatin is used in vaginal formulations to treat vaginal yeast infections.

While effective against *Candida*, Nystatin's effectiveness against other fungal species varies. It's not effective against systemic fungal infections.


### Dosage

**Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition, age, and formulation (oral suspension, tablets, cream, ointment, vaginal cream). Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.** The following is a general guideline and may not reflect all possible dosages:


**Adults:**

* **Oral candidiasis (oral thrush):** Oral suspension: 4-6 mL (400,000-600,000 units) four times daily (QID).  Swish in the mouth before swallowing.
* **Gastrointestinal candidiasis:** Oral tablets: 500,000-1,000,000 units three times daily (TID). Treatment should continue for at least 48 hours after symptoms resolve.
* **Cutaneous and mucocutaneous infections:** Topical cream or ointment: Apply to the affected area twice daily (BID) until healed.
* **Vulvovaginal candidiasis:** Vaginal cream: One applicatorful (5g) once or twice daily for up to 14 days.


**Children:**

* **Oral candidiasis:** Oral suspension: Dosage varies depending on age.  Infants may receive 2-4 mL (200,000-400,000 units) QID. Older children may receive 4-6 mL QID.  Always follow a physician's instructions.
* **Cutaneous and mucocutaneous infections:** Topical cream, ointment, or powder: Apply to affected areas twice or three times daily as directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dose adjustments are typically needed for renal or hepatic impairment due to low systemic absorption. However, always consult with a healthcare provider.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Diarrhea

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Nystatin is a polyene antifungal drug.  It works by binding to sterols, a type of lipid found in fungal cell membranes. This binding alters the membrane's permeability, causing leakage of essential components from the fungal cell.  This ultimately leads to fungal cell death (fungicidal) or inhibits fungal growth (fungistatic), depending on the concentration and duration of exposure. Importantly, Nystatin has very little effect on human cells due to differences in human cell membrane composition.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Nystatin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to nystatin or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with *Saccharomyces boulardii* (a probiotic) should be avoided, as Nystatin (oral form) may reduce its effectiveness.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nystatin is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The amount excreted in breast milk is unknown; however, oral absorption is poor. Consult your doctor about the risks and benefits before using nystatin if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  Dosage adjustments are not usually necessary for elderly or renally/hepatically impaired patients because of the medication's low systemic absorption. However, close monitoring is still recommended.
* **Topical Use:** For topical applications, avoid contact with the eyes.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Nystatin to work?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement depends on the type and severity of the infection.  You may notice improvements within a few days to a couple of weeks.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Nystatin once I feel better?** A: No.  Continue the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if symptoms improve.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection.
* **Q: How should I store Nystatin?** A:  Store as directed on the product label. This usually involves storing at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Is Nystatin safe for children?** A: Yes, but the dosage must be adjusted according to the child's age and weight. Always follow your doctor's instructions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.
