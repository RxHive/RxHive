# Nystatin

**Generic Name:** Nystatin

**Usage:** Nystatin is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections of the skin, mouth, and vagina.  Specific uses include:

* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):**  A yeast infection of the mouth and throat.
* **Vaginal candidiasis:** A yeast infection of the vagina.
* **Skin infections (cutaneous candidiasis):**  Yeast infections affecting the skin, such as diaper rash (in infants) or infections in skin folds.
* **Other superficial fungal infections:** Nystatin can be used to treat other superficial fungal infections, although other antifungals may be preferred.  A doctor will determine the appropriate use.


**Side Effects:** Nystatin is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These are usually mild and may include:

* **Oral thrush treatment:**  Slight irritation or burning in the mouth.
* **Vaginal candidiasis treatment:**  Mild vaginal irritation or burning.
* **Skin infections:**  Skin irritation or redness at the application site.
* **Rare but serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue) are rare but require immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:** Nystatin is a polyene antifungal antibiotic. It works by binding to sterols in the fungal cell membrane, specifically ergosterol. This binding disrupts the membrane's integrity, causing leakage of essential cellular components and ultimately leading to fungal cell death.  Importantly, nystatin does *not* affect human cells because human cell membranes do not contain ergosterol.


**FAQs:**

* **Is nystatin available over-the-counter?**  Yes, some formulations of nystatin (like oral lozenges or vaginal creams) are available over-the-counter. However, others may require a prescription.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The time it takes to see improvement depends on the type and severity of the infection, but improvement is usually seen within a few days to a week.  Complete resolution may take longer.
* **Can I use nystatin if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Nystatin is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it's crucial to consult with a doctor or pharmacist before using it.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?**  Nystatin generally has few drug interactions, but it's important to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
