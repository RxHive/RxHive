# Nalfurafine
### Generic Name
Nalfurafine

### Usage
Nalfurafine is primarily used to treat uremic pruritus (severe itching) in patients undergoing hemodialysis who haven't responded to standard treatments.  This means it's specifically for people with kidney failure receiving dialysis. While not officially approved for this purpose, it's sometimes used off-label to manage refractory pruritus (itching that doesn't respond to other treatments) in patients with chronic liver disease.  It's crucial to understand that off-label use should only be considered under the strict supervision of a physician.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Uremic pruritus (hemodialysis patients):** The usual starting dose is 2.5 mcg (micrograms) once daily (OD). The maximum dose is 5 mcg/day.  It's vital to leave at least 8 hours between taking Nalfurafine and starting hemodialysis.

* **Refractory pruritus in chronic liver disease (off-label):** The starting dose is typically 2.5 mcg OD.  This may be increased to 5 mcg OD if needed, based on the patient's response and tolerance to the medication.  A doctor will carefully monitor the patient's progress.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Nalfurafine in children (0-17 years old) haven't been established.  Therefore, it's contraindicated (not recommended) for use in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic (liver) impairment or renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling. However, caution is advised in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment as increased serum concentrations may occur.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Insomnia

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Malaise, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, drowsiness, restlessness, delirium, dizziness, unusual sensations, hallucinations, high fever, involuntary movements, tingling sensations, feeling cold, sleep disturbances.
* Cardiovascular: Chest discomfort, flushing, increased blood pressure.
* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, vomiting, nausea, oral tingling.
* Dermatologic: Itching, skin infections (molluscum contagiosum, tinea).
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Abnormal thyroid function test results, decreased testosterone levels, increased prolactin levels, increased lactate dehydrogenase levels.
* Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Lower back pain.
* Respiratory: Sinusitis.

**Rare Side Effects (less than 1% of patients, or frequency not defined):**

* Dermatologic: Skin discoloration, redness, bumps, hives.
* Hepatic: Increased bilirubin levels.
* Other: Abdominal distress, loss of appetite, diarrhea, eczema, eosinophilia (increased eosinophils in the blood), gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males), headache, increased liver enzyme levels (gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST), increased thirst, lethargy, palpitations, skin rash, tremor.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Nalfurafine is a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist.  This means it specifically attaches to and activates kappa-opioid receptors in the body.  These receptors are involved in regulating pain and itch sensations.  By activating these receptors, Nalfurafine helps to reduce the sensation of itch associated with uremic pruritus. Importantly, it has minimal impact on mu- and delta-opioid receptors, reducing the risk of certain side effects associated with other opioid drugs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nalfurafine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or any of its components, and in children.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nalfurafine can interact with various medications, including alcohol, other CNS depressants, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) effects (such as drowsiness, dizziness, insomnia), constipation, endocrine effects (changes in hormone levels), and hepatic effects (liver problems).  Use with caution in patients with moderate-to-severe liver impairment, the elderly, and those performing tasks requiring mental alertness.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Nalfurafine is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to unknown risks to the fetus or infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Nalfurafine?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take Nalfurafine with other medications?** A: Discuss all your current medications with your doctor or pharmacist before starting Nalfurafine to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take for Nalfurafine to work?** A: The onset of action can vary, but improvements in itching may be seen within a few days to a few weeks of starting treatment.  Your doctor will monitor your progress.

* **Q: Is Nalfurafine addictive?** A: While Nalfurafine is an opioid, its low potential for abuse and its selective action on kappa-opioid receptors minimize the risk of addiction compared to other opioid medications. However, it's crucial to use it as prescribed.
