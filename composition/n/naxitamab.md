# Naxitamab
### Generic Name
Naxitamab

### Usage
Naxitamab, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), is used to treat relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma in pediatric patients (1 year and older) and adults.  This treatment is specifically for patients whose cancer is found in the bone or bone marrow and who have shown at least a stable disease response, minor response, or partial response to prior treatment.  Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that arises from immature nerve cells.  Relapsed or refractory means the cancer has returned after treatment or hasn't responded to previous therapies.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Premedication to reduce infusion reactions and nausea/vomiting, and pain management before and during infusion are crucial.  Consult the prescribing information for detailed premedication regimens.

The dosage for both adults and children (aged 1 year and older) with relapsed or refractory high-risk neuroblastoma is the same:

* **Intravenous (IV) administration:** 3 mg/kg/day (maximum 150 mg/day) on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 4-week treatment cycle. This is given in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF).
* **Treatment Cycles:** Cycles are repeated every 4 weeks until a complete or partial response is observed, followed by 5 additional cycles.  Subsequent cycles may be repeated every 8 weeks.  Treatment is discontinued if disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
* **Premedication:** Typically includes an antihistamine, H2 antagonist, acetaminophen, and an antiemetic 30 minutes before each Naxitamab infusion.  A corticosteroid (e.g., methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg, max 80mg) may also be given 30 minutes to 2 hours before the first infusion, and for subsequent infusions if a severe reaction occurred previously.
* **Pain Management:** A 12-day course of prophylactic neuropathic pain medication (e.g., gabapentin) is started 5 days before the first infusion of each cycle. Oral opioids are given 45-60 minutes before each infusion, with IV opioids as needed for breakthrough pain.  Ketamine may be considered if pain is poorly controlled.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  Dosage modifications based on toxicity are outlined in the prescribing information and are managed by adjusting the infusion rate or permanently discontinuing the medication, depending on the severity and type of adverse reaction.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Anxiety, fatigue, headache, impaired consciousness, irritability, lethargy, pain, peripheral neuropathy
* Cardiovascular: Edema, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia
* Dermatologic: Erythema, hyperhidrosis, urticaria
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Changes in serum levels of albumin, calcium, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium; weight loss
* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* Hematologic: Bruising, decreased hemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets; lymphocytopenia
* Hepatic: Increased AST and ALT levels
* Infection: Influenza
* Local: Injection site reaction, localized edema
* Ophthalmic: Accommodation disturbance, anisocoria, blurred vision, mydriasis, photophobia, visual impairment
* Respiratory: Abnormal breath sounds, cough, nasal/upper respiratory infections, oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhea
* Other: Fever, infusion-related reactions (including severe reactions)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe neurotoxicity (severe neuropathic pain, transverse myelitis, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome [RPLS])
* Severe infusion-related reactions (anaphylaxis, cardiac arrest)
* Peripheral edema
* Apnea
* Respiratory depression
* Bronchospasm
* Stridor
* Urinary retention

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Naxitamab is a monoclonal antibody that targets GD2, a glycolipid highly expressed on the surface of neuroblastoma cells.  By binding to GD2, Naxitamab triggers the destruction of these cells through two mechanisms: antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).  ADCC involves the immune system's natural killer cells, while CDC involves components of the complement system, both working to kill the cancer cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** In patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to Naxitamab or its components.
* **Increased Risk:** Serious infusion-related reactions, neurotoxicity (including severe neuropathic pain, transverse myelitis, RPLS), hypertension, embryo-fetal toxicity.
* **Pregnancy:** Naxitamab may cause fetal harm.  Pregnancy testing is recommended before initiating treatment. Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for 2 months after the last dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 2 months after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions exist with certain medications, particularly those affecting blood pressure or immune function. Consult a healthcare professional to discuss potential interactions with any other medications being taken.
* **Monitoring:**  Close monitoring for infusion reactions, blood pressure, pain, neurologic symptoms, and other adverse effects is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Naxitamab administered?**  A: It's given intravenously (IV) over a specific timeframe, starting with a slower infusion rate for the first dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately for guidance; the missed dose may be administered later in the treatment cycle according to the instructions.

* **Q: How is Naxitamab stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known.  Regular monitoring and follow-up care are essential.

* **Q: What are the most serious side effects?** A:  Severe infusion-related reactions and neurotoxicity are the most serious potential side effects.
