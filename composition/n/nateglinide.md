# Nateglinide

**Generic Name:** Nateglinide

**Usage:** Nateglinide is an oral medication used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's typically used in conjunction with diet and exercise, and sometimes other diabetes medications. It's not used to treat type 1 diabetes.  It's usually prescribed when diet and exercise alone aren't enough to manage blood sugar.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, nateglinide can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most common and serious side effect. Symptoms can include sweating, trembling, dizziness, confusion, headache, and rapid heartbeat. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to loss of consciousness.
* **Nausea:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Diarrhea:**  Another relatively common side effect.
* **Upper respiratory tract infection:** Increased susceptibility.
* **Weight gain:** Some users may experience weight gain.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Rarely, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.

**How it Works:** Nateglinide is a meglitinide. It works by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas. This effect is dependent on the presence of glucose (sugar) in the blood.  It does not increase insulin production in the absence of glucose.  This is in contrast to sulfonylureas which have a different mechanism of action.  The increased insulin helps to lower blood sugar levels.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take nateglinide if I have type 1 diabetes?** A: No, nateglinide is not effective for type 1 diabetes because it requires functioning beta-cells in the pancreas to produce insulin, which are usually absent or severely compromised in type 1 diabetes.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking nateglinide?** A: Alcohol can increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  Consult your doctor about alcohol consumption while taking nateglinide.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience hypoglycemia?** A: If you experience symptoms of hypoglycemia, immediately consume a fast-acting source of sugar such as glucose tablets, fruit juice, or candy.  If symptoms don't improve quickly, seek medical attention.

* **Q: Can nateglinide cause weight gain?** A: Some users report weight gain, although it's not a universally experienced side effect. Weight management strategies are important for managing diabetes regardless of medication.

* **Q:  How is nateglinide different from other diabetes medications?** A: Nateglinide is a short-acting medication, meaning its effects are relatively brief and are primarily directed at lowering blood sugar levels after meals.  Other medications, like metformin or sulfonylureas, have different mechanisms and durations of action.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Follow your doctor's instructions on how to proceed if a dose is missed.
