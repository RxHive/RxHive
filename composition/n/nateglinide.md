# Nateglinide
### Generic Name
Nateglinide

### Usage
Nateglinide is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's specifically designed to work as an *add-on* to diet and exercise, not as a standalone treatment.  Nateglinide is not suitable for people with type 1 diabetes or for managing diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes). Its primary role is to help the body produce more insulin when needed, thus aiding in regulating blood sugar levels, particularly after meals.  It does not replace the importance of a healthy diet and regular physical activity.

### Dosage
**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes):** The typical starting dose is 120 mg taken three times a day (TID), 1 to 30 minutes before each meal.  For individuals already showing good blood sugar control at the start of treatment, the doctor may prescribe a lower dose of 60 mg TID.  The dosage is adjusted based on individual responses and blood sugar levels monitored by the physician.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of nateglinide in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  For mild impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically needed. However, for moderate to severe liver impairment, the drug should be used with extreme caution due to the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  Dosage adjustments are not specifically defined in manufacturer's labeling for this situation.

* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  For mild to moderate kidney impairment, no dosage adjustment is usually necessary. However, for severe kidney impairment (eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m²),  the doctor may start with a lower dose (60 mg TID) and proceed cautiously, especially if the eGFR is less than 15 mL/minute/1.73 m², because of potential accumulation of a metabolite that can cause hypoglycemia.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Upper respiratory infections

**Less Common Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Flu-like symptoms
* Bronchitis
* Coughing
* Diarrhea
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) – this is a serious side effect
* Increased uric acid levels
* Weight gain
* Arthropathy (joint problems)
* Accidental injury

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cholestatic hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions such as itching, rash, hives)
* Increased liver enzymes
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Nateglinide lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin.  This effect only happens when the body's beta cells (insulin-producing cells in the pancreas) are still functioning. Nateglinide works by interacting with specific potassium channels in these beta cells, leading to increased calcium influx and subsequent insulin secretion. Importantly, the amount of insulin released depends on the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood; insulin release decreases at low glucose concentrations, minimizing the risk of dangerously low blood sugar levels.  Nateglinide is highly selective, affecting the pancreas primarily and having minimal effect on other tissues like heart and skeletal muscle.

### Precautions
**Contraindications (Situations where the drug should not be used):**

* Allergy to nateglinide or any of its ingredients.
* Diabetic ketoacidosis.
* Type 1 diabetes.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Hypoglycemia:** Nateglinide can cause hypoglycemia, especially if meals are skipped or delayed.  Patients should be aware of the symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., shakiness, sweating, dizziness) and have a plan to treat it.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe liver or kidney disease.
* **Other Medical Conditions:**  Caution is advised in individuals with adrenal or pituitary gland problems, malnutrition, or those taking other medications that could interact with nateglinide.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Nateglinide is a category C pregnancy drug (potential risks to the fetus are not ruled out).  Other diabetes medications are generally preferred during pregnancy.  It is unknown whether nateglinide is excreted in breast milk.

**Drug Interactions:** Nateglinide's effects can be altered by several other medications, including corticosteroids, certain diuretics, some NSAIDs, and drugs affecting the liver enzymes (CYP2C9).  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store nateglinide?** A: Store nateglinide as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, before your next meal, unless it's almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nateglinide suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking nateglinide without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can affect your blood sugar levels.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The effectiveness of nateglinide varies from person to person.  Your doctor will monitor your blood sugar levels regularly to assess your response to the treatment.

* **Q: Is nateglinide right for me?** A: Only a healthcare professional can determine if nateglinide is appropriate for your specific situation based on your medical history and current health status.  They will assess your blood sugar levels and consider other factors before making a recommendation.
