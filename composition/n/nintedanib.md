# Nintedanib
### Generic Name
Nintedanib

### Usage
Nintedanib is primarily used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic and progressive lung disease.  It's also indicated for the treatment of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype.  Furthermore, nintedanib is used to slow the decline in lung function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).  In all these cases, nintedanib aims to improve patients' quality of life and slow disease progression, but it doesn't cure the underlying condition.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical adult dose is 150 mg taken orally every 12 hours.  The maximum daily dose is 300 mg. Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic impairment.  Those with mild impairment may start with 100 mg every 12 hours.  Nintedanib is generally not recommended for individuals with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  Dosage adjustments for renal impairment are not explicitly detailed in manufacturer's labeling but should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional.  Any dose reduction or interruption due to adverse effects necessitates careful monitoring and physician guidance on resuming treatment.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of nintedanib in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% of patients) include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, and decreased appetite.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include decreased weight, bleeding events, headache, hypertension, arterial thromboembolic events (blood clots), myocardial infarction (heart attack), and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).

Less common but serious side effects (<1%) include gastrointestinal perforation.

Post-marketing surveillance has also identified hepatotoxicity (liver damage), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), pruritus (itching), skin rash, and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) as potential side effects.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

### How it Works
Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by blocking the activity of several enzymes called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) involved in cell growth and blood vessel formation.  Specifically, it targets PDGFR, FGFR, VEGFR, CSF1R, and FLT3.  By inhibiting these enzymes, nintedanib reduces the growth and spread of scar tissue in the lungs, thus slowing the progression of the fibrotic lung diseases it is used to treat.

### Precautions
Nintedanib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to nintedanib, peanut, soya, or any component of the formulation.  It's also contraindicated in pregnancy.  Women of reproductive potential should use highly effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended.

Nintedanib should be used with caution in patients with high cardiovascular risk, recent abdominal surgery, a history of diverticular disease, or those taking corticosteroids or NSAIDs concurrently.  Patients with mild hepatic impairment require close monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.

Nintedanib may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly when used with anticoagulants.  It can also cause gastrointestinal problems (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and potentially perforation), liver damage, and cardiovascular events.

Close monitoring of liver function and regular assessment of overall health are crucial while on nintedanib.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take nintedanib with other medications?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications, like P-glycoprotein (P-GP) and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, can significantly affect nintedanib's effectiveness and safety.

* **Q: How should I store nintedanib?** A: Store nintedanib capsules at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep them out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking nintedanib?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit its consumption while taking nintedanib, as alcohol can exacerbate some side effects, especially those related to the gastrointestinal tract. Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of nintedanib?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known, and ongoing monitoring is crucial.  Discuss your concerns with your healthcare professional.
