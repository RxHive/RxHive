# Nilutamide
### Generic Name
Nilutamide

### Usage
Nilutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen primarily used in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer (Stage D2). It's not used alone but in combination with surgical castration (removal of the testicles).  This combination therapy aims to suppress testosterone levels, which fuels the growth of prostate cancer cells.  Nilutamide works by blocking the action of testosterone at the receptor level within the prostate cancer cells, thus hindering their growth and spread.  It is not indicated for the treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer or for use in women.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Metastatic Prostate Cancer):** The typical dosage begins with 300 mg orally once daily, starting on the same day or the day after surgical castration. This high initial dose continues for 30 days. After the initial 30 days, the dosage is reduced to 150 mg once daily.  Treatment should be discontinued if disease progression is observed.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Nilutamide is contraindicated in children; its safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, Nilutamide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic (liver) impairment or if hepatotoxicity (liver damage) develops during treatment, as evidenced by serum ALT levels exceeding twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) or the onset of jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).  If elevated liver enzymes or jaundice occur, the medication must be stopped immediately.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Hot flashes
* Nocturnal amblyopia (night blindness)


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, but requiring medical attention):**

* Dizziness
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Nervousness
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Cardiac failure
* Angina pectoris (chest pain)
* Edema (swelling)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Melena (dark, tarry stools)
* Xerostomia (dry mouth)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Arthritis
* Visual disturbances
* Cataracts
* Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
* Increased BUN and creatinine levels (kidney function indicators)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Cough
* Interstitial pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages)
* Alcohol intolerance


**Rare but serious side effects reported in post-marketing surveillance:**  Aplastic anemia (severe reduction in blood cell production), hepatic injury (liver damage), hepatitis, QT prolongation (abnormality on the electrocardiogram), and interstitial pneumonitis (potentially fatal lung inflammation).  Any new or worsening shortness of breath should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


*Note:* This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works
Nilutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen. It works by competitively binding to androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells.  By occupying these receptors, it prevents testosterone and other androgens from binding and exerting their growth-promoting effects on the cancer cells. This ultimately slows or stops the growth and spread of the cancer.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Nilutamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, severe hepatic impairment, severe respiratory insufficiency, and in women and children.


**Warnings:**  Nilutamide carries a boxed warning regarding the risk of interstitial pneumonitis. This serious lung condition can be life-threatening.  Patients should be monitored for symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. Baseline chest x-rays and pulmonary function tests may be recommended.


**Interactions:** Nilutamide can interact with various medications, including alcohol (increasing the risk of alcohol intolerance), and other drugs metabolized by the CYP2C19 enzyme.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


**Specific Populations:**  Nilutamide is not approved for use in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  Caution is advised in patients with diabetes or impaired kidney function.  Older adults may be at increased risk of certain side effects.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Nilutamide with alcohol?**

A: No, it's strongly advised to avoid alcohol while taking Nilutamide due to the increased risk of alcohol intolerance, which can cause facial flushing, hypotension, and malaise.


**Q: How should I store Nilutamide?**

A: Store Nilutamide as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.


**Q:  Can I stop taking Nilutamide if I feel better?**

A: No, do not stop taking Nilutamide without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely could lead to disease progression.


**Q: What are the long-term effects of Nilutamide?**

A: Long-term effects of Nilutamide can vary.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential to assess treatment response and manage potential side effects.
