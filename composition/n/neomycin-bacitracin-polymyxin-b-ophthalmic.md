# Neomycin + Bacitracin + Polymyxin B (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Neomycin + Bacitracin + Polymyxin B (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Neomycin + Bacitracin + Polymyxin B ophthalmic ointment is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections of the outer eye and surrounding structures.  Its primary use is in treating superficial external ocular infections.  These include conjunctivitis (pink eye), keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), keratoconjunctivitis (inflammation of both the cornea and conjunctiva), blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), and blepharoconjunctivitis (inflammation of both the eyelids and conjunctiva).  The effectiveness relies on the susceptibility of the infecting bacteria to these antibiotics.


### Dosage

**Ocular Infections (Adults and Children):**

* **Ointment:**  The typical dosage is a 0.5-inch ribbon of ointment applied to the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours for acute infections, or 2-3 times daily for milder infections. Treatment generally lasts for 7-10 days.  The specific formulation will contain Neomycin 3.5 mg, Bacitracin 400 units, and Polymyxin B 10,000 units per gram of ointment.  Always follow the specific instructions on your prescription label.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Itching, burning, stinging, or redness of the eye. Swelling of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye).
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis – a severe, life-threatening reaction), failure of the infection to heal, and the development of new infections (superinfection).  Allergic contact dermatitis (skin rash) is also possible.


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.

### How it Works

This ophthalmic ointment contains three antibiotics that work in different ways to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria:

* **Bacitracin:** Prevents bacteria from building their cell walls, leading to cell death.
* **Neomycin:** Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, stopping bacteria from producing essential proteins for survival.
* **Polymyxin B:** Damages the bacterial cell membrane, causing the contents of the bacterial cell to leak out, leading to cell death.

By combining these three antibiotics, the ointment provides broader coverage against a range of bacteria commonly causing eye infections.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to neomycin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, or any other component of the formulation.
* **Warnings:** Prolonged use can increase the risk of developing an allergy to neomycin or a secondary infection (superinfection) caused by non-susceptible organisms.  There is increased risk for neomycin sensitization.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is classified as Category C during pregnancy. This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  The risk to a pregnant woman should be carefully weighed against the potential benefit.  Excretion into breast milk after ophthalmic administration is unknown; the risks associated with each individual antibiotic should be evaluated before use in breastfeeding women.
* **General Considerations:** This medication is for ophthalmic (eye) use only.  Avoid contaminating the tip of the ointment tube to prevent infection.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use this medication?** A: Typically 7-10 days, but always follow your doctor's instructions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I use this medication with other eye drops or ointments?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist. Using multiple eye medications simultaneously may interfere with each other’s effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q:  What if my symptoms don't improve or worsen?** A:  Consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.  This could indicate that the infection is not responding to the treatment or that a different infection is present.
