# Niclosamide
### Generic Name
Niclosamide

### Usage
Niclosamide is an anthelmintic medication, meaning it's used to treat parasitic worm infections.  Its primary use is in treating tapeworm infestations.  Specifically, it's effective against several species of tapeworms including *Taenia saginata* (beef tapeworm), *Taenia solium* (pork tapeworm), *Diphyllobothrium latum* (fish tapeworm), and *Hymenolepsis nana* (dwarf tapeworm).  While less common, it also has applications as a molluscicide in controlling schistosomiasis, although this is not a typical clinical use.

### Dosage

**Tapeworm Infections:**

* **Adults:** A single 2g oral dose is usually prescribed for *Taenia saginata*, *Taenia solium*, and *Diphyllobothrium latum* infections.  For *Hymenolepsis nana*, the dosage is 2g on day one, followed by 1g daily for six days.
* **Children:** Dosage varies based on age:
    * Under 2 years: 500mg single dose (*Taenia* species) or 500mg single dose followed by 250mg daily for 6 days (*Hymenolepsis nana*)
    * 2-6 years: 1g single dose (*Taenia* species) or 1g single dose followed by 500mg daily for 6 days (*Hymenolepsis nana*)
    * Over 6 years and adolescents: 2g single dose (*Taenia* species) or 2g single dose followed by 1g daily for 6 days (*Hymenolepsis nana*)

**Important Note:**  For all age groups, if constipation is present, it's crucial to address this before administering niclosamide. A strong saline laxative is often recommended 2 hours after taking the medication.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Abdominal pain
* Loss of appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects include hypersensitivity reactions.  Any unusual or concerning side effect warrants immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Niclosamide primarily targets the mitochondria of tapeworms.  It inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, a crucial process for energy production within the mitochondria. By disrupting this process, niclosamide depletes the worms' energy supply, leading to their death and eventual expulsion from the body.  Importantly, niclosamide's systemic absorption is low, minimizing potential side effects in the human host.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Niclosamide is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to niclosamide or any of its components.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of allergies, the elderly, children under 2 years of age, pregnant women (especially during the first trimester), and breastfeeding mothers.  Niclosamide is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning that animal reproduction studies haven't shown harm, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions are not extensively documented, it's always prudent to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **CNS Depression:** Niclosamide may increase the risk of CNS depression; therefore, caution is warranted, especially in individuals taking medications that have similar effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I take niclosamide?** A:  Usually, niclosamide is taken orally. Chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly or crushed and mixed with water. It's often recommended to take it on an empty stomach, but this may be adjusted to minimize gastrointestinal upset.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  If you miss a dose, consult your physician or pharmacist for advice as soon as possible.

* **Q: How should I store niclosamide?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct light and heat, and out of reach of children.

* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A:  The effects of niclosamide usually become apparent after treatment, often leading to the expulsion of dead worm segments in the stool.  Consult your doctor if you do not see improvement or if symptoms worsen.
