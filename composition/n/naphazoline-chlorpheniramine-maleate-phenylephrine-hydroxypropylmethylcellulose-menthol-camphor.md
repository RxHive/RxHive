# Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + Menthol + Camphor

**Generic Name:**  Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + Menthol + Camphor (This is a combination product, so there isn't one single generic name.)

**Usage:** This combination is typically found in over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant sprays and solutions.  It's used to relieve symptoms of nasal congestion associated with the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies.  Each ingredient plays a specific role:

* **Naphazoline and Phenylephrine:** These are vasoconstrictors. They shrink the blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It helps to reduce allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itching.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** This is a thickening agent and lubricant. It helps to coat and soothe irritated nasal passages.
* **Menthol and Camphor:** These are counterirritants. They create a cooling sensation, providing temporary relief from nasal discomfort.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation in the nose:** This is relatively common, especially with the vasoconstrictors.
* **Drowsiness:** This is more likely with the antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate).
* **Rebound congestion:**  Prolonged use of vasoconstrictors can lead to worsening congestion when the medication wears off. This is why it's crucial to follow dosage instructions carefully and not use these products for extended periods.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with higher doses of vasoconstrictors.
* **Increased blood pressure:** More likely with higher doses of vasoconstrictors.
* **Insomnia:** Especially if used later in the day.
* **Dry mouth:**
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.


**How it Works:** As detailed above, the combination works by targeting different aspects of nasal congestion and allergy symptoms.  Vasoconstrictors reduce swelling, antihistamines block histamine release, and the other ingredients provide soothing and cooling effects.
