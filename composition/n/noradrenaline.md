# Noradrenaline
### Generic Name
Noradrenaline (also known as Norepinephrine)

### Usage
Noradrenaline is primarily used in emergency situations to treat acute hypotension (dangerously low blood pressure) and shock.  It's a powerful vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure.  This makes it crucial in conditions where blood pressure has dropped critically, such as during cardiac arrest, septic shock (shock caused by infection), and cardiogenic shock (shock due to heart failure).  While not its primary indication, noradrenaline is sometimes used off-label in other life-threatening conditions requiring immediate blood pressure support.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage is highly variable and depends on the severity of the condition and patient response. It's almost always administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion using an infusion pump.  Typical starting doses and ranges include:

* **Hypotension/Shock:**  Initial infusion rates typically begin between 8-12 mcg/minute, titrated (adjusted) upward or downward to achieve the desired blood pressure.  Maintenance doses usually range from 2-4 mcg/minute.

* **Post Cardiac Arrest Care (ACLS):**  Weight-based dosing is often used; initial infusion rate may start at 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/minute.  This needs to be carefully monitored and adjusted based on the patient's response.

* **Cardiogenic Shock (Off-label):** Continuous IV infusion at 0.05-0.4 mcg/kg/minute may be considered.

* **Sepsis and Septic Shock:** This is an off-label use, with a weight-based continuous IV infusion ranging from 0.01-3 mcg/kg/minute.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For infants, children, and adolescents with hypotension/shock, a continuous IV infusion of 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/minute is typically used, titrated to effect, with a maximum dose of 2 mcg/kg/minute.  Pediatric dosing requires close monitoring by a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, careful monitoring is essential in patients with these conditions.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Anxiety, transient headache, bradycardia (slow heart rate), cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).

* **Less Common but Serious:**  Cardiomyopathy (stress-induced heart muscle disease), peripheral vascular insufficiency (reduced blood flow to the limbs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), peripheral gangrene (tissue death due to lack of blood flow), peripheral ischemia (reduced blood supply to the limbs).

**Important Note:** Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.  This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.


### How it Works

Noradrenaline acts on both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors in the body.  By stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors, it causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), increasing peripheral resistance and blood pressure. Stimulation of beta1-adrenergic receptors increases heart rate and contractility (the force of heart contractions), further boosting cardiac output and blood pressure.  The combined effect increases blood pressure and improves blood flow to vital organs like the heart and brain.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Noradrenaline is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypotension caused by hypovolemia (low blood volume) except as a temporary measure to maintain blood flow to the heart and brain until the volume is restored.
* Mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis (blood clots blocking vessels).
* During anesthesia with cyclopropane or halothane.

**Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of extravasation (leakage of the drug from the IV line into surrounding tissue), which can cause severe tissue damage.

**Use with Caution:** Noradrenaline should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Profound hypoxia (low oxygen levels) or hypercarbia (high carbon dioxide levels).
* Asthma or sulfite allergy.
* Breastfeeding.

**Drug Interactions:** Noradrenaline can interact with numerous other medications, including MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other sympathomimetics.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking before starting noradrenaline therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is noradrenaline stored?**  A:  Storage requirements vary depending on the specific formulation. Always follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.

* **Q: Can I stop taking noradrenaline suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping noradrenaline abruptly can be dangerous and should only be done under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially serious ones.

* **Q: Is noradrenaline safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: The safety of noradrenaline in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  A doctor should carefully assess the situation before prescribing it.

* **Q:  What if noradrenaline leaks out of the IV line?** A:  Extravasation can cause severe tissue damage.  Immediate action by a healthcare professional is required to minimize harm.
