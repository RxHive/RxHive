# Nefazodone
### Generic Name
Nefazodone

### Usage
Nefazodone is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (depression).  It's an antidepressant that works differently than many other antidepressants on the market. While not as commonly prescribed as some newer options, it remains a viable treatment for those who respond well to its mechanism of action.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Treatment for depression typically begins with 100 mg taken twice daily (every 12 hours).  The doctor may increase this dose gradually, by 50-100 mg per dose, at weekly intervals, until an effective dose is reached, usually between 200 and 600 mg daily.  Older adults often start on a lower dose (50 mg twice daily) due to the potential for increased side effects and slower drug clearance.  Dosage adjustments are generally made under close medical supervision.

**Children:**  Nefazodone is **not** approved for use in children and adolescents due to safety concerns.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for those with liver or kidney problems.  People with liver impairment, specifically cirrhosis, may need lower doses due to reduced drug metabolism, and nefazodone is contraindicated in those with liver injury caused by prior nefazodone use.  Dosage adjustments aren't typically needed for those with kidney issues.  Switching to or from a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) requires a 14-day gap between stopping one medication and starting the other.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache

* Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Abnormal liver function tests (requiring immediate medical attention)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially in young adults; requires immediate medical attention)
* Serotonin syndrome (rare, but potentially fatal; characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental state)

If any adverse effects occur, contact a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Nefazodone is a unique antidepressant that doesn't fit neatly into the categories of SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or MAOIs. It works by affecting multiple neurotransmitters in the brain. Specifically, it inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their availability in the brain. It also blocks certain serotonin receptors (5-HT2 receptors) and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, contributing to its antidepressant and other effects.  These actions help to alleviate symptoms of depression.

### Precautions

* **Liver Problems:** Nefazodone can cause serious liver damage, including liver failure. Regular liver function tests are essential during treatment.  The medication should be stopped immediately if symptoms like jaundice, fatigue, or loss of appetite occur.  It should not be used by individuals with active liver disease or elevated liver enzymes.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nefazodone interacts with many other drugs, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  These interactions can significantly alter the effectiveness and safety of both nefazodone and the other drugs.  Examples include several statins, certain antihistamines, and other antidepressants.  Itâ€™s crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken. Concurrent use with carbamazepine, cisapride, terfenadine, astemizole, or pimozide is contraindicated. Triazolam usage with Nefazodone requires a significant dose reduction in the triazolam.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nefazodone is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under a doctor's close supervision.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to side effects, particularly those affecting balance and blood pressure. Lower starting doses and careful monitoring are recommended.
* **Suicidal Thoughts:**  Like all antidepressants, nefazodone carries a risk of increased suicidal thoughts, particularly in young adults. Close monitoring for changes in mood or behavior is essential, especially at the start of treatment and when doses are adjusted.  This risk necessitates careful consideration of the benefit-to-risk ratio when prescribing this drug.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I stop taking Nefazodone suddenly?**

A: No, it's important to gradually reduce the dosage under a doctor's supervision to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

**Q: How should I store Nefazodone?**

A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and light, in a child-proof container.

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Nefazodone?**

A:  Alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Never double up on doses.

**Q: Is Nefazodone habit-forming?**

A: Nefazodone is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or other substances. However, stopping it suddenly after long-term use can cause withdrawal symptoms, highlighting the importance of a gradual tapering-off process.
