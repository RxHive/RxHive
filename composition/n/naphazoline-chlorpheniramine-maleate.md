# Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and the common cold.  Naphazoline is a nasal decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that reduces the effects of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.  This combination is typically used for temporary relief of nasal congestion, sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, and itchy throat.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a significant side effect, particularly with chlorpheniramine. Avoid driving or operating machinery while using this medication.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:** This is common with both components.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Insomnia (sleeplessness):**  Less common, but possible, especially with higher doses or individual sensitivity.
* **Increased heart rate:**  More likely with naphazoline, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Increased blood pressure:** More likely with naphazoline.


**More serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention:**  These include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), irregular heartbeat, chest pain, and seizures.

**How it Works:**

* **Naphazoline (Decongestant):**  Works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and mucus production, leading to easier breathing.  Its effect is temporary, and prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion (worsening of congestion).
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (Antihistamine):** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens.  By blocking histamine, it reduces symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes.
