# Netupitant + Palonosetron
### Generic Name
Netupitant + Palonosetron

### Usage
Netupitant and Palonosetron is a combination medication used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.  This includes both the acute nausea and vomiting that occurs soon after treatment and the delayed nausea and vomiting that can appear later. It's particularly effective in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens (those that are very likely to cause severe nausea and vomiting), such as those using cisplatin. While primarily used for cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, its use in other contexts is not established.


### Dosage

**Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV):**

* **Highly emetogenic chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin-based):**  The typical adult dose is one 300 mg Netupitant and 0.5 mg Palonosetron capsule taken orally one hour before the start of chemotherapy on day 1.  This is usually given in conjunction with other antiemetics like dexamethasone and olanzapine for optimal effect, with the latter two medications potentially extending over several days following the initial dose.  (Consult specific treatment guidelines for precise combination therapy)


* **Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (e.g., anthracycline/cyclophosphamide-based):** The adult dose is the same as above (one 300 mg Netupitant and 0.5 mg Palonosetron capsule orally one hour before chemotherapy on day 1).  Again, it is commonly used alongside other antiemetics like dexamethasone and possibly olanzapine (depending on the specific chemotherapy regimen). (Consult specific treatment guidelines for precise combination therapy)


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Netupitant + Palonosetron in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B). However, the medication should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30-60 mL/min.  The medication should be avoided in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Erythema (redness of the skin)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Constipation
* Weakness


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** While less frequent, serious side effects are possible.  These include hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis) and the risk of serotonin syndrome (especially if combined with other serotonergic drugs).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Netupitant blocks the action of substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in triggering nausea and vomiting. Palonosetron blocks the action of serotonin, another neurotransmitter that plays a key role in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  By working together through distinct mechanisms, these two drugs offer broader and more effective antiemetic protection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Netupitant + Palonosetron is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either component and in pregnant women.  It should also be avoided in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.

* **Interactions:** Netupitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, an enzyme responsible for metabolizing many drugs. This means it can increase blood levels of other medications metabolized by CYP3A4, potentially leading to increased side effects.  Concurrent use with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) is contraindicated, while use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) requires careful monitoring.  The combination can also interact with other antiemetics, certain chemotherapy agents, and serotonergic drugs, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Netupitant + Palonosetron is contraindicated in pregnancy. Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for one month afterward.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for one month after the last dose.

* **Elderly Patients:** Use caution in elderly patients, as they may be more susceptible to side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Netupitant + Palonosetron with food?** A: Yes, it can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Since this medication is typically administered just before a chemotherapy cycle, missing a dose would require consultation with your oncologist or healthcare provider to reschedule appropriately.

* **Q: How should I store Netupitant + Palonosetron?** A: Store as directed on the packaging, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects might resolve on their own.  However, if you experience any severe or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.
