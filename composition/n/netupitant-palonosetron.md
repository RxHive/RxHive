# Netupitant + Palonosetron

**Generic Name:** Netupitant/Palonosetron

**Usage:**

Netupitant/Palonosetron is a combination medication used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by moderately or highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (CINV).  It's typically administered before the start of chemotherapy.  It is *not* used for nausea and vomiting caused by other factors, such as pregnancy, motion sickness, or other illnesses.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Constipation:**  Some patients experience difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Fatigue/tiredness:**  Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Somnolence (sleepiness):** Excessive sleepiness.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **QT prolongation:**  This is a potential heart rhythm abnormality that requires monitoring, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Serotonin syndrome:**  Rare but serious condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, rapid heart rate, and altered mental state.  Requires immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

Netupitant/Palonosetron works by targeting different mechanisms that contribute to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:

* **Netupitant:**  This is a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist.  NK1 receptors are involved in transmitting signals related to nausea and vomiting in the brain. By blocking these receptors, netupitant helps reduce the feeling of nausea.

* **Palonosetron:** This is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. 5-HT3 receptors are found in the brain and gut and are involved in the vomiting reflex. Palonosetron blocks these receptors, further reducing nausea and vomiting.

The combination of netupitant and palonosetron provides broader and more effective antiemetic action than either drug alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.
