# n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate
### Generic Name
n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate

**Note:** n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate is not a medicine in the traditional sense. It's a type of cyanoacrylate adhesive, commonly known as super glue, with medical applications primarily for wound closure.  It's crucial to understand that its use should be strictly under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. Self-medication with cyanoacrylate adhesives is strongly discouraged.

### Usage
n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate is used primarily as a topical tissue adhesive for the closure of minor wounds.  Its medical applications mainly focus on:

* **Closure of superficial wounds:**  This includes small cuts, lacerations, and abrasions where sutures (stitches) might be unnecessary or impractical.
* **Surgical wound closure:** In some surgical procedures, it can be used as an adjunct to sutures or in situations where sutures are undesirable.
* **Closure of skin grafts:** It can be used to help secure skin grafts in place.


It's important to note that this adhesive is not suitable for all wounds.  Deep wounds, wounds with significant infection, or wounds involving significant tissue damage require more advanced treatment methods and shouldn't be treated with cyanoacrylate.

### Dosage
There is no standardized "dosage" in the traditional sense for n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate. The amount used depends entirely on the size and nature of the wound. A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate amount needed for effective wound closure.  Application is typically done by a doctor or trained medical personnel.  It's applied directly to the wound edges, which are then brought together and held until the adhesive sets.

**No oral or IV administration is possible or recommended.**

### Side Effects
* **Skin irritation:** Redness, itching, and mild burning sensations are possible at the application site.
* **Allergic reaction:**  Although rare, allergic reactions to cyanoacrylate are possible.  Symptoms can range from mild skin reactions to more serious systemic reactions requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Delayed wound healing:** In some cases, the adhesive may interfere with normal wound healing processes.
* **Pain:**  Application may cause some discomfort.
* **Scarring:**  While generally minimal, scarring is a possibility.
* **Adhesive residue:** Removing excess adhesive can be challenging and may require specialized solvents.

**Serious side effects are uncommon but require immediate medical attention.** These could include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), significant pain or inflammation, or signs of infection.

### How it Works
n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate works by rapidly polymerizing (hardening) upon contact with the moisture present in the wound. This creates a strong, flexible bond that holds the wound edges together, facilitating the natural healing process.  The polymer acts as a barrier, protecting the wound from contamination and promoting faster closure.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Cyanoacrylate should not be used on wounds that are infected, deep, or involve significant tissue loss. It's also contraindicated in individuals with known allergies to cyanoacrylates.
* **Drug Interactions:**  There are no known significant drug interactions with n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, but it should be discussed with a doctor if other topical medications are being used on the affected area.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of cyanoacrylate use during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been extensively studied.  Consult a doctor before use.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.
* **Eye Contact:**  Avoid contact with eyes. Immediate flushing with copious amounts of water and medical attention are required if contact occurs.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I buy this and use it at home?** A: No.  n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate is not available for over-the-counter use. Its application requires proper medical assessment and should only be administered by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How long does it take to set?** A: The setting time varies depending on the wound moisture and the amount applied, but it usually sets within seconds to minutes.
* **Q: What if I get it on my skin?** A:  Remove any excess adhesive carefully.  If irritation occurs, consult a doctor.
* **Q: How is it removed from the skin?** A:  Specialized solvents might be necessary for removal of any excess adhesive. A doctor will be able to advise the best course of action.
* **Q: Does it leave a scar?** A:  Scarring is possible, but typically minimal.
* **Q: How long does the adhesive last?** A: The adhesive will remain in place until the wound has healed sufficiently.
