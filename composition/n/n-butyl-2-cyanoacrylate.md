# n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate

**Generic Name:** n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate

**Usage:**  n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate is primarily used as an adhesive, specifically a fast-acting, strong cyanoacrylate adhesive.  Its applications are diverse and include:

* **Medical:**  While not as common as other cyanoacrylates (like ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate), it has seen some use in surgical tissue adhesives, particularly in veterinary medicine. However, its use is often limited due to its slower degradation compared to other formulations, potential for irritation, and the availability of better alternatives.
* **Industrial:**  More frequently used in industrial settings for bonding various materials like plastics, metals, rubber, and wood.  Its rapid curing time and strong bond make it valuable for many applications where speed and strength are paramount.
* **Hobby & Craft:**  It can be found in some hobby and craft adhesives, though usually under a brand name and often combined with other components to improve handling and reduce skin irritation.

**Side Effects:**

* **Skin Irritation:**  The most common side effect is skin irritation, ranging from mild redness and itching to more severe reactions in sensitive individuals.  Contact with skin should be avoided, and immediate washing with soap and water is recommended in case of accidental contact.
* **Eye Irritation:**  Contact with eyes is extremely dangerous and can lead to severe irritation, corneal damage, and even blindness.  Immediate and thorough flushing with water and seeking medical attention are crucial.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Some individuals may develop allergic reactions, including contact dermatitis.
* **Inhalation Hazards:**  Inhaling the vapors can irritate the respiratory tract.  Adequate ventilation is crucial during use.


**How it Works:**

n-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate works through an anionic polymerization process.  When it comes into contact with moisture (present in air or on the surfaces to be bonded), it undergoes a rapid polymerization reaction.  This reaction creates long chains of polymer molecules, resulting in a strong, rigid bond between the surfaces.  The butyl group influences the rate of polymerization and the properties of the resulting adhesive compared to other cyanoacrylates like ethyl or methyl-2-cyanoacrylate.  The butyl group makes it slightly less reactive, leading to a slower curing time and potentially a more flexible bond.


**FAQs:**

* **Is n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate toxic?** While not inherently acutely toxic in small amounts, it can cause irritation and allergic reactions.  Proper handling and safety precautions are essential.
* **How do I remove n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate?**  Acetone or other cyanoacrylate solvents may be effective, but caution is needed as these solvents can also be irritating.
* **Is n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate safe for medical use?** Its use in medical applications is limited compared to other cyanoacrylates due to slower degradation and potential for irritation.  Consult a medical professional for appropriate medical adhesive choices.
* **What are the differences between n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate and other cyanoacrylates?** The butyl group affects the polymerization rate and adhesive properties, leading to a slower curing time and potentially a more flexible bond compared to other cyanoacrylates like ethyl or methyl-2-cyanoacrylate.
