# Nitric oxide
### Generic Name
Nitric Oxide (NO)

**Note:**  Nitric oxide isn't typically administered as a standalone "medicine" in the same way as a pill or injection for treating a specific disease. Instead, it's a naturally occurring molecule in the body with crucial physiological roles.  Therapeutic uses involve *enhancing* its natural production or effects, rather than directly administering large quantities of the gas itself.  Therefore, the information below reflects its therapeutic uses and considerations, acknowledging its unique nature.

### Usage
Nitric oxide plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, and its therapeutic applications arise from this.  Primarily, it's used in:

* **Treatment of Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS):** This is a serious lung condition in premature infants.  Inhaled nitric oxide helps improve blood flow to the lungs, aiding in oxygenation.  This is its most established and widely accepted therapeutic application.

* **Pulmonary Hypertension:**  NO can help improve blood flow in the lungs in cases of pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs).  This is often used in research settings and specific clinical situations where other treatments are insufficient.

* **Research and Experimental Uses:** Nitric oxide's role in various cardiovascular and other physiological processes makes it a subject of ongoing research.  Its use in various therapeutic areas beyond those listed above is largely experimental.

### Dosage
There's no standard dosage for nitric oxide as a "medication" because its administration is highly specialized and context-dependent. Inhaled nitric oxide for neonatal RDS is administered through specialized equipment that precisely controls the concentration of the gas delivered to the infant's lungs. The concentration and duration of therapy are determined by the severity of the condition and the infant's response, monitored closely by healthcare professionals.  Dosage in other applications (e.g., research settings) will vary drastically depending on the experimental design.

### Side Effects
Because nitric oxide is a gas administered under carefully controlled conditions, side effects are generally related to the delivery system or underlying conditions rather than directly to the nitric oxide itself.  However, potential side effects might include:

* **Methemoglobinemia:** In rare cases, high concentrations of inhaled nitric oxide can lead to methemoglobinemia, a condition where the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced.  This is closely monitored during treatment.
* **Toxicity:** Although rare with proper administration, toxicity can occur with excessive exposure.


### How it Works
Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator, meaning it relaxes and widens blood vessels.  This improves blood flow.  In the lungs, this enhanced blood flow improves oxygenation.  Its effects are complex, and its mechanism of action involves interactions with various enzymes and signaling pathways within the body.

### Precautions
* **Administration:**  Nitric oxide is administered only in controlled healthcare settings using specialized equipment.  It's not available for self-administration.
* **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of blood gases, heart rate, and blood pressure is crucial during nitric oxide therapy, particularly in neonatal RDS.
* **Interactions:** Potential interactions with other medications are possible, and healthcare professionals must carefully consider any concurrent treatments.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of nitric oxide in pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful assessment of the risks and benefits by healthcare professionals.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I buy nitric oxide as a supplement?** A:  No, nitric oxide itself is not available as a supplement in a form suitable for therapeutic use.  Many supplements claim to "boost" nitric oxide production, but their efficacy and safety are often questionable.
* **Q: Is nitric oxide dangerous?** A: Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule essential for life, but in high concentrations or improperly administered, it can be toxic.  Therapeutic use requires strict medical supervision.
* **Q: How is nitric oxide stored?** A: In therapeutic settings, nitric oxide is stored and administered using specialized compressed gas cylinders and delivery systems.
* **Q: Who should administer nitric oxide?** A: Only trained healthcare professionals with specialized equipment should administer nitric oxide.  It is not for self-administration.
