# Nicotinamide + Folic Acid + Cyanocobalamin

**Generic Name:** Nicotinamide + Folic Acid + Cyanocobalamin (This is a combination product;  each ingredient has its own generic name: Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3), Folic Acid (Vitamin B9), and Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12))

**Usage:**  This combination is primarily used to treat or prevent deficiencies in vitamins B3, B9, and B12.  Specific uses may include:

* **Pernicious anemia:**  A condition where the body can't absorb enough vitamin B12.
* **Megaloblastic anemia:** A type of anemia caused by deficiencies in folate or vitamin B12.
* **Neural tube defects (prevention during pregnancy):** Folic acid is crucial for preventing these birth defects.
* **Neurological disorders:** Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in nerve function, and deficiency can cause neurological symptoms.
* **Other deficiencies:**  Supplementing these vitamins can help treat deficiencies caused by poor diet, malabsorption syndromes, or certain medical conditions.  A doctor will determine the appropriate use based on individual needs.


**Side Effects:** Generally, these vitamins are well-tolerated at recommended doses.  However, side effects can occur, though they are usually mild and infrequent. These may include:

* **Nicotinamide:** Flushing (redness of the skin), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, liver damage (at very high doses).
* **Folic Acid:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea).  High doses may mask underlying vitamin B12 deficiency, potentially worsening neurological symptoms.
* **Cyanocobalamin:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  High doses may cause acne.


**How it Works:**

* **Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3):** Plays a crucial role in energy production, DNA repair, and cell signaling. It's a precursor to NAD+, a coenzyme involved in numerous metabolic processes.
* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Essential for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, crucial for cell growth and division, particularly important during pregnancy for fetal development.
* **Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Vital for the production of red blood cells, DNA synthesis, and nerve function. It's involved in several metabolic processes, including the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids.
