# Nitroxoline
### Generic Name
Nitroxoline

### Usage
Nitroxoline is primarily used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs).  It's an antibiotic effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  While its main application is in UTIs, research is exploring its potential anticancer properties, particularly in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.  However, this is still in the clinical trial phase and not yet a standard treatment.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for treating UTIs is 400-600 mg per day, divided into multiple doses and taken after meals.  Treatment should generally continue for at least 7 days.  In some cases, nitroxoline may be used in combination with another antibiotic, such as sulfamethizole.  Specific dosage recommendations for children, individuals with liver or kidney impairment, pregnant women, or breastfeeding mothers are not clearly established in current literature and require consultation with a healthcare professional.  The medication is typically administered orally in tablet form.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. A notable side effect is the deep yellow coloration of urine. This is usually harmless and related to the excretion of the drug.  Serious side effects are rare but require immediate medical attention. Consult a doctor if you experience any unexpected or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
Nitroxoline's antibacterial mechanism is believed to be related to its ability to interfere with metal ion complexation, essential for bacterial growth. Its potential anticancer activity, still under investigation, appears to involve the inhibition of MetAP2 (methionine aminopeptidase 2) protein, a factor involved in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow).

### Precautions
Nitroxoline is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to nitroxoline or any component of the formulation, and in those with anuria (absence of urine production).  It should be used with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women because the safety profile in these groups is not fully established.  The potential for drug interactions needs to be considered.  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q:  How long does it take for Nitroxoline to work?**  A:  Improvement in UTI symptoms may start within a few days, but a full course of treatment (at least 7 days) is necessary to eliminate the infection completely.
