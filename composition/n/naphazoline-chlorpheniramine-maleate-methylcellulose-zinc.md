# Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Methylcellulose + Zinc
### Generic Name
Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Methylcellulose + Zinc

**Note:** This combination is typically found in over-the-counter (OTC) ophthalmic solutions for the relief of eye irritation and redness.  The exact ratios of each ingredient can vary between brands.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for precise composition and dosage information.


### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of eye irritation and redness caused by various factors such as allergies, exposure to irritants, or minor eye injuries.

* **Naphazoline:** A sympathomimetic decongestant, it works by constricting blood vessels in the eye, reducing redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, it helps to alleviate itching and other allergic symptoms in the eye.
* **Methylcellulose:** A viscosity-increasing agent, it acts as a lubricant, soothing irritated eyes and helping to retain moisture.
* **Zinc:** Often included for its potential anti-inflammatory and astringent properties. It may contribute to reducing eye irritation.


This product is for symptomatic relief only and does not treat the underlying cause of eye irritation.


### Dosage
This medication is typically administered topically to the affected eye(s).  Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific product formulation.  The usual dosage involves instilling one or two drops into the affected eye(s) up to three or four times daily, as directed on the product label.

**Children:**  Use in children should only be under the direction of a pediatrician or ophthalmologist.  The dosage for children is not standardized and will depend on age and condition.

**Oral and IV Administration:** This specific combination is not designed for oral or intravenous administration.  It is solely for topical ophthalmic use.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Burning or stinging sensation upon application, temporary blurred vision, eye dryness.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Increased eye pressure (especially in individuals with glaucoma), allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), eye pain, changes in vision.


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works
The individual components of this medication work synergistically to alleviate eye irritation symptoms:

* **Naphazoline** constricts blood vessels in the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye), reducing redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate** blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions, thereby reducing itching, watering, and other allergic symptoms.
* **Methylcellulose** increases the viscosity of the eye drops, providing lubrication and helping to maintain moisture on the eye's surface.
* **Zinc** potentially contributes by possessing anti-inflammatory and astringent properties, further helping to reduce irritation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with known allergies to any of its components.  Individuals with narrow-angle glaucoma or other eye conditions should consult an ophthalmologist before use.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While generally considered safe for topical use, interactions with other medications are unlikely.  However, it's important to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Use in children and older adults should be under the supervision of a physician.  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Contact Lenses:**  Remove contact lenses before applying the medication and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
