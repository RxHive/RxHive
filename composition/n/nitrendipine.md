# Nitrendipine
### Generic Name
Nitrendipine

### Usage
Nitrendipine is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers the pressure your heart has to work against to pump blood throughout your body.  While not its primary indication, it may also be used in certain cases to manage angina (chest pain) although this is less common and requires careful consideration by a physician.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on individual needs and response to treatment, so it's crucial to follow a doctor's prescribed regimen.

**Adults:**  For hypertension, the typical starting dose is 20 mg once daily or divided into two doses.  This may be increased to 20 mg twice daily as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 40 mg.  However,  elderly patients often require a lower starting dose (possibly 10mg once daily).

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of nitrendipine in children have not been established, and it is not generally used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  People with liver problems may need a reduced dose (50% of the usual starting dose).  Renal (kidney) impairment may not necessarily require dosage adjustment, but close monitoring by a doctor is vital.


**Forms:**  Nitrendipine is typically available as oral tablets.

**Administration:** It's usually advised to take nitrendipine with food to minimize potential stomach upset.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Headache, dizziness, flushing, swelling in the ankles or feet (peripheral edema), nausea.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Fast heartbeat (tachycardia), palpitations, abnormal liver function test results.  Rarely, allergic reactions may occur.
* **Important Note:** If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Nitrendipine belongs to a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers.  Calcium plays a crucial role in the contraction of muscles, including the smooth muscle in your blood vessel walls. Nitrendipine works by blocking the entry of calcium into these smooth muscle cells. This relaxation of the blood vessels reduces blood pressure and reduces the workload on the heart, easing the symptoms of hypertension and angina.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nitrendipine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to nitrendipine or other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, cardiogenic shock, recent myocardial infarction (within one month), unstable angina, advanced aortic stenosis, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several medications can interact with nitrendipine.  Specifically, bile acids can increase nitrendipine levels, while cimetidine may decrease them.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, that you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:**  Elderly patients and those with liver impairment require careful dose monitoring and adjustments.  It's crucial to exercise caution in patients with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, digital ischemia, poor cardiac reserve, or Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  It's absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they can significantly affect nitrendipine levels in the body.  Avoid hazardous activities until you know how this medication affects you, as it may cause dizziness.  Be aware of the potential for a sudden drop in blood pressure, especially when first starting the medication.  Rise slowly from a sitting or lying position to minimize dizziness.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take nitrendipine with other medications?**  A:  It is essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store nitrendipine?** A: Store nitrendipine in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can I stop taking nitrendipine suddenly?**  A:  No, you should never stop taking nitrendipine without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to rebound hypertension.
* **Q:  Will nitrendipine cause weight gain?** A: While weight gain isn't a common side effect, some individuals may experience fluid retention leading to swelling (edema). Discuss any concerning weight changes with your healthcare provider.
* **Q: Is nitrendipine safe for older adults?** A: While it can be used in older adults, careful dose adjustment and close monitoring are typically necessary due to increased sensitivity to its effects and the higher prevalence of other health conditions.
