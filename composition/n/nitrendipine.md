# Nitrendipine

**Generic Name:** Nitrendipine

**Usage:**

Nitrendipine is a calcium channel blocker primarily used to treat:

* **Hypertension (high blood pressure):** It helps relax blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.
* **Angina (chest pain):** By dilating coronary arteries, it increases blood flow to the heart, reducing chest pain.


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, nitrendipine can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A frequent side effect, often mild and resolving with continued use.
* **Dizziness:** Can be caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure.
* **Flushing:** Feeling of warmth or redness in the face.
* **Swelling in ankles and feet (edema):** Fluid retention.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Palpitations:** Feeling of a rapid or irregular heartbeat.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can cause dizziness, fainting, or lightheadedness.
* **Heart problems:** Irregular heartbeat or worsening angina.


**How it Works:**

Nitrendipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  Calcium plays a crucial role in the contraction of heart muscle and blood vessel walls.  Nitrendipine works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into these cells. This relaxation of blood vessels leads to:

* **Vasodilation:** Widening of blood vessels, reducing peripheral resistance and lowering blood pressure.
* **Decreased heart rate (in some cases):**  Although less prominent than its vasodilatory effects.
* **Increased coronary artery blood flow:** Improves blood supply to the heart muscle.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking nitrendipine?** A:  Alcohol can further lower blood pressure, potentially leading to dizziness or fainting. It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking nitrendipine. Consult your doctor.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nitrendipine suddenly?** A: No.  Sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: What are the interactions with other medications?** A: Nitrendipine can interact with several other medications, including some antidepressants, antifungal medications, and grapefruit juice.  Inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **Q:  Is nitrendipine suitable for everyone?** A: No.  It is not suitable for people with certain conditions, such as severe heart problems or low blood pressure. Your doctor will assess your suitability.
