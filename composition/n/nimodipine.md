# Nimodipine
### Generic Name
Nimodipine

### Usage
Nimodipine is primarily used to improve neurological outcomes in adult patients who have experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to a ruptured intracranial berry aneurysm.  It's crucial to understand that Nimodipine doesn't treat the aneurysm itself but aims to reduce the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits (damage to brain tissue due to lack of blood flow) that can follow SAH.  This is achieved regardless of the patient's neurological condition after the initial hemorrhage (meaning it's used across different severity levels).  It's important to note that Nimodipine is not indicated for other types of hemorrhage or cerebrovascular events.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage and administration vary depending on whether it's given orally or intravenously (IV) and the patient's weight and blood pressure stability.  Always follow a doctor's specific instructions.

* **Oral:** For subarachnoid hemorrhage, the typical dose is 60 mg (often equivalent to 10 mL of oral solution) every 4 hours for 21 days, or until IV therapy begins.  For patients weighing less than 70 kg or with unstable blood pressure, the dosage may need to be reduced.

* **IV:** The usual starting dose for subarachnoid hemorrhage is 1 mg/hour for two hours. If well-tolerated, this can be increased to 2 mg/hour.  IV administration typically continues for 5 to 14 days.  For patients weighing less than 70 kg or those with unstable blood pressure, the initial infusion rate may be reduced to 0.5 mg/hour or less.  The IV formulation should be given continuously through a central catheter using an infusion pump, and is typically co-infused with another fluid.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Nimodipine have not been established in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):** Oral dosage may be reduced to 30 mg every 4 hours for patients with cirrhosis.  IV dosage adjustments aren't specified in manufacturer labeling, but caution is advised.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  Dosage adjustments aren't generally needed as Nimodipine is not removed by dialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Decreased blood pressure
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Nausea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):** These are often reported post-marketing or in case studies.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur:

* Anemia
* Decreased platelet count
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Dizziness
* Edema (swelling)
* Flushing
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Gastrointestinal pseudo-obstruction
* Hematoma (blood clot)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure) â€“ paradoxical effect
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Increased blood glucose levels
* Intestinal obstruction
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
* Muscle cramps
* Palpitations
* Pruritus (itching)
* Rebound vasospasm (return of blood vessel constriction)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Vomiting
* Wheezing


### How it Works

Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker, specifically a dihydropyridine. It works by selectively blocking the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells. This effect is more pronounced in cerebral arteries (brain blood vessels) than in other arteries. By reducing calcium entry, it helps relax and widen these blood vessels, improving blood flow to the brain.  This improved blood flow is thought to be the mechanism by which it reduces the neurological damage following a subarachnoid hemorrhage.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Nimodipine is contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in specific circumstances involving concurrent use of certain medications (see Interactions section). IV administration is contraindicated in patients with active or recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

* **Drug Interactions:** Nimodipine interacts with numerous drugs, including other calcium channel blockers, antihypertensives, CYP450 3A4 inhibitors/inducers, and others.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  Significant interactions can increase the risk of hypotension (low blood pressure) or alter Nimodipine's effectiveness.

* **Warnings:**  Intravenous administration should only be done under strict medical supervision. Accidental intravenous injection of the oral formulation can be fatal.  Caution is needed in patients with liver disease or certain heart conditions (like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks.

* **Other Important Precautions:** Oral Nimodipine should be taken on an empty stomach.  Do not crush the tablets.


### FAQs
