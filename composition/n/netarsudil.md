# Netarsudil
### Generic Name
Netarsudil

### Usage
Netarsudil is primarily used to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  These conditions cause damage to the optic nerve, potentially leading to vision loss. By reducing IOP, Netarsudil helps protect the optic nerve and preserve vision.  While its primary use is in these specific conditions, it's crucial to understand that it does not treat the underlying causes of glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  It only manages a symptom (high IOP).


### Dosage
**Adults (Open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension):** The typical dose is one drop of 0.02% ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.  Do not exceed one drop per day in each affected eye.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Netarsudil in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are needed based on hepatic or renal impairment due to the low systemic absorption of the medication.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* Application-site pain
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye)
* Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the conjunctiva)
* Corneal deposits (build-up of substances on the cornea)

Less common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) include:

* Erythema of the eyelid (redness of the eyelid)
* Application-site erythema (redness at the site of application)
* Blurred vision
* Corneal staining
* Decreased visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision)
* Increased lacrimation (increased tear production)

Serious side effects are rare but can include bacterial keratitis (infection of the cornea).  If you experience any adverse effects, especially changes in vision or signs of infection, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Netarsudil is a dual-mechanism drug that works by inhibiting Rho-kinase and norepinephrine transporters (NETs) in the eye. These enzymes play a role in regulating the outflow of aqueous humor (the fluid in the eye that nourishes it). By inhibiting these enzymes, Netarsudil increases the outflow of aqueous humor, thereby reducing IOP.  The exact mechanism is still under investigation, but the overall result is a decrease in pressure within the eye.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed, but caution should be exercised.
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known, but it is best to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Netarsudil during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Corneal Disease:** Use with caution in patients with existing corneal disease or damage to the surface of the eye.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before administering Netarsudil and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Netarsudil to work?** A:  The effects of Netarsudil on IOP typically begin within a few weeks of starting treatment, but it might take longer to see a full reduction in pressure.
* **Q: Can I use Netarsudil with other eye drops?** A:  Yes, it may be used with other eye drops to lower IOP, but administer them at least 5 minutes apart.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Simply continue with the next scheduled dose in the evening. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store Netarsudil?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct light and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any significant or concerning side effects, especially vision changes or signs of infection.
