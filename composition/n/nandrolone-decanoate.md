# Nandrolone Decanoate
### Generic Name
Nandrolone Decanoate

### Usage

Nandrolone decanoate is an anabolic steroid with several approved uses.  Its primary applications are in treating anemia associated with chronic kidney disease and aplastic anemia.  It's also used to address conditions causing negative nitrogen balance (where the body breaks down more protein than it builds),  to provide palliative care for inoperable metastatic breast cancer in women, and to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis in women.  It's important to understand that its use in these conditions is highly specific and requires careful medical supervision.  Nandrolone decanoate is not appropriate for general muscle building or enhancement.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's characteristics.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.  This information is for general understanding and should not be used to self-medicate.  The medication is administered via intramuscular injection (IM).

* **Conditions with negative nitrogen balance:** 25-50 mg every 2-3 weeks.
* **Inoperable metastatic breast cancer (women):** 50 mg every 2-3 weeks.
* **Postmenopausal osteoporosis (women):** 50 mg every 2-3 weeks.
* **Anemia (chronic kidney disease):** 100 mg (women) or 200 mg (men) once weekly.
* **Aplastic anemia:** 50-150 mg once weekly.

**Pediatric use:**  The safety and effectiveness of nandrolone decanoate in children have not been established.

**Dosage adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment by the manufacturer, though caution is advised in these cases. Some manufacturers even contraindicate its use in severe hepatic or renal disease.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include virilization symptoms in women (hoarseness, acne, increased hair growth, changes in libido).

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects can include:

* Abnormal liver function test results
* Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate)
* Decreased HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol)
* Fluid retention
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hyperlipidemia (high levels of fat in the blood)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Impotence
* Testicular atrophy (shrinking of the testicles)
* Skin rashes
* Various other effects, such as changes in urine flow and various other symptoms.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, immediately contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Nandrolone decanoate is an anabolic steroid that acts as an agonist to the androgen receptor.  This means it binds to and activates the androgen receptor in cells. This process triggers a chain of events leading to increased protein synthesis and potentially stimulating red blood cell production (relevant to its use in anemia).  The effects on bone density are also relevant to its use in osteoporosis.  Unlike some other anabolic steroids, nandrolone decanoate is not metabolized into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), minimizing some potential side effects associated with DHT.


### Precautions

* **Contraindicated in:** Hypersensitivity to nandrolone decanoate, pregnancy, breastfeeding, nephrosis or nephrotic-phase nephritis, severe hepatic disease with impaired bilirubin excretion, severe cardiac failure, male patients with breast or prostate cancer, and porphyria. Patients allergic to peanuts or soy (due to oil components in some formulations) should also avoid it.
* **Use with caution in:** Patients with a history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease, cardiac disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, conditions influenced by edema (fluid retention), hepatic or renal impairment, the elderly, and neonates (formulations containing benzyl alcohol).
* **Drug interactions:** Nandrolone decanoate may interact with numerous medications, such as blood glucose-lowering agents, C1 inhibitors, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and vitamin K antagonists.  Corticosteroids can increase nandrolone decanoate levels.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of liver function, blood counts, lipid profile, glucose (in diabetics), bone mineral density (in osteoporosis), and other parameters as directed by your physician is usually necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is nandrolone decanoate stored?** A:  Store according to the instructions provided by the pharmacist. Usually, it involves keeping it at room temperature, away from light and moisture, and out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I stop taking nandrolone decanoate abruptly?** A: No. Always follow your doctor's instructions for stopping treatment. Sudden cessation could lead to withdrawal symptoms or other complications.
* **Q: Is nandrolone decanoate safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use carries increased risk of side effects. Your doctor will carefully assess the benefits and risks.
* **Q:  Can I take other supplements while using nandrolone decanoate?** A:  Always discuss any supplements or over-the-counter medications with your doctor before taking them with nandrolone decanoate.  Some interactions can be dangerous.
