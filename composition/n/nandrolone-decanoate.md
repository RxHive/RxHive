# Nandrolone Decanoate

**Generic Name:** Nandrolone Decanoate

**Usage:** Nandrolone Decanoate is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) primarily used off-label by bodybuilders and athletes to increase muscle mass and strength.  It's not approved by the FDA for any medical use in the United States, though it has been used in other countries to treat conditions like osteoporosis and anemia in specific situations and under medical supervision.  **Its use without a prescription is illegal and dangerous.**

**Side Effects:**  The side effects of Nandrolone Decanoate can be significant and vary depending on the dosage and individual factors.  They include, but are not limited to:

* **Androgenic effects:**  Increased facial and body hair, acne, oily skin, male-pattern baldness (in predisposed individuals), enlarged clitoris (in females), deepened voice (in females).
* **Estrogenic effects:** Gynecomastia (breast development in males), fluid retention, high blood pressure.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Liver damage (though generally less than some other AAS).
* **Cardiovascular effects:** Increased LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol), decreased HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol), increased risk of heart disease and stroke.
* **Endocrine effects:** Suppression of natural testosterone production (leading to hypogonadism), decreased fertility, menstrual irregularities (in females).
* **Musculoskeletal effects:** Tendon injuries, muscle pain.
* **Other side effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, changes in libido, mood swings, aggression, sleep disturbances, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).

The severity of side effects is often dose-dependent and can be influenced by individual genetic factors, overall health, and the duration of use.


**How it Works:** Nandrolone Decanoate is a synthetic derivative of testosterone.  It binds to androgen receptors in muscle cells, promoting protein synthesis and muscle growth.  It also has some estrogenic effects due to aromatization (conversion to estrogen). The decanoate ester extends its release time in the body, providing a longer duration of action compared to other forms of nandrolone.
