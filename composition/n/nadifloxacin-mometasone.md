# Nadifloxacin + Mometasone

**Generic Name:** Nadifloxacin + Mometasone furoate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat bacterial and steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the eye, such as bacterial conjunctivitis with associated inflammation.  It's important to note that this is not an over-the-counter medication and requires a prescription.  The specific condition being treated will determine the length and frequency of use, as instructed by an ophthalmologist or other qualified healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness
* **Allergic reactions:** Eyelid swelling, rash, hives
* **Increased intraocular pressure (IOP):**  This is particularly relevant with prolonged use of the corticosteroid component (mometasone). Regular IOP monitoring might be necessary.
* **Other potential side effects:**  Blurred vision, headache, eye pain, changes in taste

**How it Works:**

* **Nadifloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis, thereby killing bacteria causing the infection.
* **Mometasone furoate:** This is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and allergic responses in the eye. It works by suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators.  The combination of the antibiotic and corticosteroid addresses both the infection and the associated inflammation.
