It's available in various forms like gums, lozenges, patches, inhalers, and nasal sprays, all designed to deliver a controlled dose of nicotine to help smokers manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings during the quitting process.  It is also sometimes used in research settings to study the effects of nicotine on the brain and body.  Importantly, **it is not meant to be a recreational drug**.

* **Mouth/Throat Irritation:**  Common with gum, lozenges, and inhalers.

* **Headache:**  Can be a withdrawal symptom or a side effect of nicotine itself.

**How it Works:** Nicotine is a highly addictive stimulant that acts primarily on the central nervous system. It binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain, influencing the release of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine. This dopamine release leads to feelings of pleasure and reward, contributing to nicotine addiction.  In smoking cessation aids, the controlled release of nicotine helps to alleviate the intense withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting, making it easier to break the addiction cycle.
