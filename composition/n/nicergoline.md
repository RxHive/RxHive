# Nicergoline
### Generic Name
Nicergoline

### Usage
Nicergoline is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with senile dementia and other conditions stemming from impaired blood flow in the brain (cerebrovascular insufficiency).  It's also used to manage peripheral vascular disease, which involves reduced blood flow to the limbs.  While its primary application targets cognitive decline related to reduced blood supply to the brain, it aims to improve blood circulation and associated symptoms rather than directly addressing the underlying cause of dementia.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the route of administration and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescription.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Peripheral vascular disease; mental deterioration associated with cerebrovascular insufficiency:**
    * **Oral:**  The initial dose is typically 10 mg three times a day (TID).  The maintenance dose may be adjusted to 5-10 mg TID, with a maximum daily dose of 60 mg divided into multiple administrations.
    * **Intramuscular (IM):** 2-4 mg twice a day (BID).
    * **Intravenous (IV):** 4-8 mg administered as a slow infusion over 30 minutes.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of nicergoline in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Specific adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment aren't explicitly detailed in manufacturer labeling.  For renal (kidney) impairment, if the serum creatinine level is less than 2 mg/dL, no dosage adjustment is typically recommended. However, if the creatinine level is 2 mg/dL or higher, a dose reduction is suggested, though precise adjustments aren't specified in standard labeling.  Consult your doctor for guidance.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency varies, consult your physician for specific percentages):**

* Gastrointestinal distress (abdominal discomfort)
* Fatigue
* Feeling hot (flushing)

* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)
* Increased thirst
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Constipation
* Vomiting
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Fibrosis (scarring of tissue)

**Other Reported Side Effects (Post-marketing surveillance and case reports):** Agitation, confusion, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dyspepsia (indigestion), headache, hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels), hypotension (low blood pressure), insomnia, mood disorders, nausea, nightmares.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious or unusual, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Nicergoline is an ergot derivative that works primarily by affecting blood vessels. It inhibits alpha-1 adrenoceptors, receptors found on the muscles surrounding blood vessels. This inhibition reduces the vasoconstricting effect of substances like epinephrine and norepinephrine, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This improved blood flow, particularly to the brain and extremities, is believed to alleviate symptoms associated with conditions like cerebrovascular insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Nicergoline is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to nicergoline, ergot alkaloids, or any formulation components; acute hemorrhage; orthostatic hypotension; recent myocardial infarction (heart attack); severe bradycardia (slow heart rate); concurrent use with sympathomimetic drugs; evident bradysphygmia (slow pulse); and patients under 18 years old.
* **Increased Risk:** Nicergoline may increase the risk of CNS depression and cardiovascular effects.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with porphyria, gout or hyperuricemia, renal impairment, and those taking anticoagulants, antiplatelet medications, or antihypertensive medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nicergoline's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established.  It's generally recommended to avoid using it during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking nicergoline?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking nicergoline, as it can potentially interact with the medication and worsen side effects, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular system.

* **Q: How should I store nicergoline?** A: Store nicergoline as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nicergoline suddenly?** A:  No, do not stop taking nicergoline abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation might lead to adverse effects or worsening of the condition being treated. Your doctor will guide you on how to safely discontinue the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Are there any specific tasks I should avoid while taking nicergoline?** A:  Nicergoline can cause drowsiness and dizziness.  Avoid activities requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, until you know how this medication affects you.
