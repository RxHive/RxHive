# Norelgestromin + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Norelgestromin + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage
Norelgestromin and Ethinylestradiol is a combination hormonal contraceptive, available as a transdermal patch, primarily used to prevent pregnancy in women with a body mass index (BMI) less than 30 kg/m².  It's important to note that its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy might be reduced in women weighing 90 kg (198 lbs) or more.  This medication is not indicated for any other conditions besides contraception.

### Dosage
**Adults (women of reproductive age):** The medication is administered via a transdermal patch.  One patch is applied weekly for three weeks (21 days), followed by one week without a patch.  The patch should be applied on the same day each week ("patch change day").  There should be no more than a seven-day gap between patches.

* **Day 1 Start:** The first patch is applied on the first day of the menstrual cycle (within the first 24 hours).
* **Sunday Start:** The first patch is applied on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation. If menstruation begins on a Sunday, the patch is applied that day.  With a Sunday start, a non-hormonal backup contraceptive method should be used for the first seven days unless menstruation starts on a Sunday.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Norelgestromin and Ethinylestradiol have only been established in women of reproductive age.  Its use before menarche is not indicated.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The medication is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for renal impairment; however, caution is advised, and blood pressure should be closely monitored.  Switching from other contraceptive methods requires specific guidelines outlined in the prescribing information, considering the timing and need for backup contraception.  Detailed instructions on switching from various methods (oral contraceptives, implants, injections, IUS, progestin-only pills, transdermal systems, vaginal rings) and usage after childbirth or abortion/miscarriage are available in the prescribing information.

### How it Works
Norelgestromin and Ethinylestradiol is a combination hormonal contraceptive that prevents pregnancy through a multi-faceted mechanism. Primarily, it suppresses ovulation by inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.  This, in turn, reduces the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, preventing the maturation and release of an egg.  Additionally, the medication alters cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to penetrate, and it may also affect the uterine lining, making it less hospitable for implantation.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of breast cancer or other hormone-dependent cancers, hepatic tumors, unexplained uterine bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension, current or history of blood clots, certain cardiovascular conditions, severe liver disease, use of specific Hepatitis C drug combinations,  and women over 35 who smoke.  It's also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Warnings:**  Increased risks of breast cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer, thromboembolic events, cardiovascular events, high blood pressure, and other serious complications have been associated with combined hormonal contraceptives.  Patients with a history of depression, diabetes, or risk factors for cardiovascular disease should use this medication with caution and close monitoring.

**Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs.  Consult your healthcare provider about any other medications you are taking.

**Specific Populations:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use this medication.  Use caution in older adults and those with underlying health conditions.
