# Nafamostat
### Generic Name
Nafamostat

### Usage
Nafamostat is a medication with a multifaceted role in treating serious medical conditions. Its primary use is as an anticoagulant, preventing blood clotting during procedures like hemodialysis or plasmapheresis, particularly in high-risk patients.  This is crucial to avoid complications during these life-sustaining treatments.  Beyond this, Nafamostat is used in managing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition where blood clots form throughout the body.  Furthermore, it's employed to alleviate acute symptoms associated with various forms of pancreatitis, including new-onset, chronic exacerbation, post-operative, and those caused by pancreatography or trauma.  In these cases, it helps to reduce the inflammation and severity of the condition.


### Dosage
Dosage for Nafamostat varies considerably based on the specific condition being treated and the route of administration.  Always follow the instructions of your healthcare provider, as they will tailor the dosage to your specific needs.

* **Anticoagulant (during extracorporeal circulation):**  Usually administered intravenously (IV) into the extracorporeal anticoagulant line at a rate of 20-50 mg/hour, with an average around 35 mg/hour. Dosage adjustments are symptom-dependent.

* **Pancreatitis:**  Typically given intravenously at a dose of 10 mg once or twice daily (OD or BID), adjusted as needed based on the patient's response.

* **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):** Administered intravenously as a continuous infusion at a rate of 0.06-0.2 mg/kg/hour for 3-5 days.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of Nafamostat in premature infants, newborns, infants, and children haven't been established. Therefore, it's not typically recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling currently does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before adjusting the dosage yourself.


### Side Effects
Nafamostat, like many medications, can cause side effects.  While many are mild, some can be serious.  It is vital to report any concerning symptoms to your doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Abnormal liver function test (LFT) results


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Decreased mental acuity
* Headache
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Chest pain
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Palpitations
* Shock
* Erythema (redness)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Electrolyte disorders
* Increased lactate dehydrogenase levels
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased serum bilirubin
* Jaundice
* Non-immune anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Inflammation, pain, or swelling at the injection site
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Fever


**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**

* Skin rash



### How it Works
Nafamostat is a serine protease inhibitor, meaning it blocks the activity of certain enzymes called serine proteases.  These enzymes play a vital role in blood clotting and inflammation.  By inhibiting these enzymes, Nafamostat prevents excessive blood clotting during procedures and reduces inflammation associated with pancreatitis.  Specifically, it affects trypsin, platelet aggregation, and several coagulation factors, including thrombin, factor Xa, factor XIIa, factor VIIa, kallikrein, and components of the complement system.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Nafamostat is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Nafamostat or any of its components.

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients taking Nafamostat may have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), bleeding, hematologic effects (leukopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia), hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and extravasation (leakage from a blood vessel).

* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when administering Nafamostat to elderly patients and those with hyponatremia.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Nafamostat during pregnancy hasn't been established; it should only be used when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, therefore breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Potential interactions with other medications exist, so it is vital to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Nafamostat stored?** A: Storage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation.  Always refer to the product labeling for precise guidance. Typically, it should be stored at a controlled room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Nafamostat without consulting my doctor?** A: No.  Abruptly stopping Nafamostat can have potentially negative consequences, depending on the condition it's treating. Always consult your healthcare provider before changing your dosage or stopping treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially those that are severe or concerning, to your healthcare provider immediately.
