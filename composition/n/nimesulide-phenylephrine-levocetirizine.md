It's crucial to understand that providing detailed medical information, including side effects and how a medication works, is beyond the scope of this AI and should only be done by a qualified healthcare professional.  The information below is for general knowledge and informational purposes only and should **not** be considered medical advice.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication.**

**Generic Name:** Nimesulide + Phenylephrine + Levocetirizine


**Usage:** This combination of medications is typically used to treat symptoms associated with the common cold and flu, or allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  Each component addresses a specific symptom:

* **Nimesulide:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain and fever.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that helps relieve nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Levocetirizine:** An antihistamine that helps relieve allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.


**Side Effects:**  Potential side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Some possible side effects include:

* **Nimesulide:** Stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, dizziness, headache, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  Rare but serious side effects include liver damage and kidney problems.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Increased blood pressure, nervousness, insomnia, headache, dizziness.
* **Levocetirizine:**  Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness.


**How it Works:**

* **Nimesulide:**  Inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Levocetirizine:**  Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing allergy symptoms.
