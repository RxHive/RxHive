# Norethindrone + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Norethindrone + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage

Norethindrone and Ethinylestradiol is a combination birth control pill containing a progestin (norethindrone) and an estrogen (ethinylestradiol).  Its primary use is **contraception** (preventing pregnancy).  It's also approved for treating **moderate acne vulgaris** in post-menarcheal females at least 15 years old who desire combination hormonal contraceptive therapy, haven't responded to topical treatments, have no contraindications to combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), and plan to use it for at least 6 months.  The combination is also sometimes used off-label to treat acute abnormal uterine bleeding.  Finally, some formulations are used for the **prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis** and the treatment of **moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes)** associated with menopause.  Note that the use of this medication for conditions beyond contraception requires careful consideration of the risks and benefits by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (different strengths of norethindrone and ethinylestradiol are available) and the intended use.  Always follow the instructions provided with your specific prescription.

**Contraception:**  Generally, one tablet is taken orally once daily, starting on a specific day depending on the chosen regimen (e.g., Sunday start or Day 1 start).  The product labeling will provide detailed instructions for the starting day and the need for backup contraception during the initial phase.  Efficacy may not be established for individuals with a BMI >35 kg/mÂ².

**Acne Vulgaris:** The dosage is the same as for contraception.

**Osteoporosis Prevention & Vasomotor Symptoms (Postmenopausal):**  Specific formulations with lower doses of both norethindrone and ethinylestradiol are used.  One tablet daily is typically prescribed.

**Acute Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (Off-label):**  A higher dose of ethinyl estradiol (0.035 mg) and norethindrone (1mg) may be prescribed three times daily for seven days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  While some formulations are approved for contraception and acne treatment in postmenarcheal adolescents aged 15 or older, dosage remains similar to the adult dose, but careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits is crucial.  Use in pre-menarcheal girls is not indicated.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Headache
*   Migraine
*   Mood changes (depression, anxiety)
*   Nausea
*   Breast tenderness
*   Weight changes (gain or loss)
*   Breakthrough bleeding or spotting
*   Changes in menstrual flow (including amenorrhea)
*   Abdominal pain
*   Edema (swelling)
*   Acne

Less common but serious side effects include blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, heart attack), high blood pressure, liver problems, and gallbladder disease.  Immediately contact your healthcare provider if you experience any serious side effects.  The complete list of potential side effects is extensive and can be found in the medication's package insert.


### How it Works

Norethindrone and ethinylestradiol works by preventing pregnancy through a combination of mechanisms.  Ethinylestradiol suppresses the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, preventing ovulation (the release of an egg). Norethindrone thickens cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and alters the uterine lining, making it less receptive to a fertilized egg.  In postmenopausal women, the estrogen component helps replace the declining levels of natural estrogen, while the progestin helps prevent endometrial hyperplasia. The mechanism of action in acne treatment is less clearly understood but likely involves hormonal regulation of sebum production.


### Precautions

*   **Specific Populations:**  Special caution is needed in individuals with diabetes, high blood pressure, epilepsy, migraine headaches, or a family history of blood clots.  Older adults may also experience different side effects or have increased sensitivity to the drug.
