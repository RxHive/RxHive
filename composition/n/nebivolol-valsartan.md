# Nebivolol + Valsartan
### Generic Name
Nebivolol + Valsartan

### Usage
Nebivolol + Valsartan is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines a beta-blocker (nebivolol) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (valsartan). This combination works synergistically to lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  While not explicitly indicated for other conditions, the individual components have uses in other cardiovascular settings; however, this combination should only be used under the guidance of a physician for hypertension.

### Dosage
The dosage of Nebivolol + Valsartan is individualized based on the patient's response to treatment.  It is typically administered once daily (OD).

* **Adults (Hypertension):**  The usual starting dose is one tablet of Nebivolol 5 mg/Valsartan 80 mg daily.  The maximum effect is usually seen within 2-4 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond this may not provide significantly greater blood pressure reduction.  This combination may replace individual nebivolol 5mg and valsartan 80mg treatments.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Nebivolol + Valsartan in children have not been established. It should not be used in children.

* **Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  Individuals with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) may not require initial adjustment. However, those with moderate (Child-Pugh class B) or severe (Child-Pugh class C) impairment should generally not use this medication or should have their dosage carefully adjusted by a doctor.  For renal impairment, dosage adjustments are typically unnecessary for creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 30-80 mL/min; however, it is generally not recommended as initial therapy for CrCl <30 mL/min.  Precise dosage adjustments should always be determined by a physician based on individual patient needs and monitoring.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Lower blood pressure (hypotension)

Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Irregular heartbeat (bradycardia)
* Worsening of heart failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Liver problems (abnormal liver function tests)

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as more serious, contact your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works
Nebivolol works by blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility (the force of the heart's contractions), thus lowering blood pressure.  It also helps to dilate blood vessels, further reducing blood pressure. Valsartan blocks angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, valsartan causes the blood vessels to relax and widen, which lowers blood pressure.  The combined effect of these two mechanisms leads to a significant reduction in blood pressure.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Nebivolol + Valsartan is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to either component, cardiogenic shock, decompensated heart failure, certain types of heart block, severe bradycardia, severe hepatic impairment, or those concurrently taking aliskiren (a medication for high blood pressure) if they also have diabetes.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with several other drugs, including those for diabetes, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cardiac glycosides, alpha-blockers, and other antiarrhythmic agents.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Nebivolol + Valsartan is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm. It should be discontinued immediately upon confirmation of pregnancy.  It is not known whether this medication passes into breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this combination medication.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with conditions like asthma, severe peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, kidney or liver problems should be carefully monitored while taking this medication.  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medication.  Sudden cessation of treatment should be avoided;  dosage should always be tapered gradually under medical supervision.
