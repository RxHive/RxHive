# Nitrofurantoin

**Generic Name:** Nitrofurantoin

**Usage:** Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible bacteria.  It's typically used for uncomplicated UTIs affecting the bladder. It is *not* effective against infections outside the urinary tract.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Pulmonary:** Pulmonary reactions (rare but potentially serious), including cough, shortness of breath, lung inflammation (interstitial pneumonitis), and pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung).  This is more common with long-term use.
* **Neurological:** Headache, dizziness.
* **Hematological:**  Anemia (rare).
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives.
* **Other:**  Discoloration of urine (brown, yellow, or orange).

Severe side effects are rare but require immediate medical attention.  These can include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:** Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction)
* **Severe lung reactions:**  Progressive lung damage
* **Liver damage**
* **Peripheral neuropathy:**  Nerve damage in the extremities causing numbness, tingling, or pain.


**How it Works:** Nitrofurantoin works by damaging the DNA of bacteria, preventing their growth and reproduction.  It's bacteriostatic (stops bacterial growth) at lower concentrations and bactericidal (kills bacteria) at higher concentrations.  Its mechanism is unique, making it less likely to develop cross-resistance with other antibiotics.  However, bacterial resistance is still possible.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long do I take Nitrofurantoin?**  A: The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor and depends on the severity of the infection, usually 5-7 days.  Do not stop taking it early, even if you feel better.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Nitrofurantoin?** A: Alcohol may increase the risk of side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Nitrofurantoin.

* **Q: Can I take Nitrofurantoin during pregnancy?** A:  Nitrofurantoin is generally avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy due to potential risks to the developing baby. Its use in the first and second trimesters should be carefully considered by your doctor.

* **Q:  Can I take Nitrofurantoin with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.  Mild side effects may resolve on their own, but it's always important to inform your doctor.

* **Q: Is Nitrofurantoin a broad-spectrum antibiotic?** A: No, it has a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, primarily effective against Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria commonly found in urinary tract infections.
