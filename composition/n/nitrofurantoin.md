# Nitrofurantoin
### Generic Name
Nitrofurantoin

### Usage

Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic primarily used to treat and prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) that affect the bladder and urethra (lower urinary tract).  It's particularly effective against *Escherichia coli*, a common cause of UTIs.  Importantly, nitrofurantoin is *not* used to treat UTIs affecting the kidneys (pyelonephritis) or surrounding tissues (perinephric abscess) because it doesn't reach sufficient concentrations in those areas.  It's also sometimes used off-label to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy (bacteria in the urine without symptoms), although its use during pregnancy requires careful consideration and should only be used when other options are unsuitable.  Postcoital prophylaxis (taking a dose after sexual intercourse) may be considered for women with recurrent UTIs linked to sexual activity.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation of nitrofurantoin (e.g., macrocrystals, monohydrate).  Always follow a healthcare provider's prescription.

**Adults:**

* **Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis (Treatment):**  Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals: 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 5 days (females) or 7 days (males).  Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals: 50-100 mg every 6 hours.
* **Uncomplicated Cystitis (Prophylaxis):** Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals or macrocrystals: 50-100 mg once daily (OD) at bedtime for 3-12 months.
* **Postcoital Prophylaxis:** Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals or macrocrystals: 50-100 mg as a single dose within 2 hours of intercourse.

**Children:** Dosage for children is calculated based on weight and is usually given as a suspension.  Consult a healthcare provider for precise dosing information.  For example,  for treating UTIs, a common approach is to prescribe 5-7 mg/kg/day divided into four doses, but this can vary considerably depending on the child's age and weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in individuals with severe kidney impairment (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min) or those with a history of liver problems related to nitrofurantoin use.  Dosage adjustments are not typically made for those with mild to moderate liver impairment, but use should be cautious.

**Administration:** Nitrofurantoin is usually taken orally.  Capsules should be swallowed whole unless instructed otherwise; suspensions should be shaken well before administration. Taking it with food can minimize gastrointestinal side effects.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

* Headache
* Nausea
* Flatulence
* Decreased hemoglobin levels
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Increased serum phosphate levels
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)

Less common but serious side effects (can occur at any frequency):

* Allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis)
* Pulmonary reactions (cough, dyspnea, pulmonary fibrosis)
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling in extremities)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Nitrofurantoin is a bactericidal antibiotic that works by interfering with several essential bacterial processes.  Inside bacteria, it's reduced to reactive molecules that damage bacterial DNA, RNA, proteins, and cell walls, ultimately preventing their growth and replication. Its effectiveness is primarily confined to the urinary tract due to its limited distribution to other parts of the body. The broad mechanism of action contributes to the relatively low rate of bacterial resistance to nitrofurantoin.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in individuals with known allergy to the drug, severe kidney impairment, significant liver problems related to prior nitrofurantoin use, pregnant women at term (38-42 weeks), during labor and delivery, or imminent labor, and neonates younger than one month old.
* **Interactions:** Nitrofurantoin can interact with various medications, including antacids, some diuretics, and certain other drugs.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nitrofurantoin is generally considered safe during the first two trimesters of pregnancy in specific situations if other alternatives are inappropriate; however,  it's contraindicated during the third trimester and labor.  It's excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should discuss use with their healthcare provider.
* **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency:** Individuals with G6PD deficiency are at increased risk of hemolytic anemia and should exercise caution when using nitrofurantoin.
* **Renal and Hepatic Function:**  Monitor kidney and liver function, especially with prolonged use.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for nitrofurantoin to work?** A:  You may start feeling better within a few days, but the full course of treatment should be completed as prescribed.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking nitrofurantoin?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking nitrofurantoin, as it can potentially increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: How should I store nitrofurantoin?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  Is nitrofurantoin a broad-spectrum antibiotic?** A: No, nitrofurantoin has a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, primarily targeting Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli, and certain Gram-positive bacteria,  but it is less effective against many common pathogens.
