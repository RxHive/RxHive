# Nirmatrelvir + Ritonavir

**Generic Name:** Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir

**Usage:**  Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir is an antiviral medication used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.  This includes individuals with underlying medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, or compromised immune systems. It is administered as early treatment, typically within five days of symptom onset.  **Important Note:** This medication requires a prescription and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  It is not a preventative medication and should not be used for prophylaxis.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects include:

* **Taste changes (dysgeusia):**  This is a very frequently reported side effect.  It can range from a mild alteration in taste to a complete loss of taste.
* **Diarrhea:**  Another frequently reported side effect.
* **Nausea:**  Can occur in some individuals.
* **Vomiting:** Less common than nausea.
* **Muscle aches:**
* **Headache:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Elevated liver enzymes (in some cases):** This necessitates monitoring liver function.

More serious, but less common, side effects can include allergic reactions and pancreatitis.  Anyone experiencing severe side effects should seek immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:** Nirmatrelvir is a protease inhibitor that directly targets the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  It works by preventing the virus from replicating by inhibiting a crucial enzyme (the main protease) needed for viral replication. Ritonavir is a boosting agent that slows down the metabolism of nirmatrelvir, allowing it to remain in the body for a longer time at higher concentrations, thus improving its effectiveness.
