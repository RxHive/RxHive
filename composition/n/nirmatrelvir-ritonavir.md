# Nirmatrelvir + Ritonavir
### Generic Name
Nirmatrelvir + Ritonavir

### Usage
Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir is a combination antiviral medication used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in adults and children (12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg).  It's specifically indicated for individuals who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and are at high risk of developing severe illness, potentially leading to hospitalization or death.  This medication is *not* for preventing COVID-19 or treating severe/critical cases requiring hospitalization.


### Dosage
**Adults and Pediatric Patients (≥12 years, ≥40 kg):** The recommended dose is one 300 mg tablet of Nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) taken with one 100 mg tablet of Ritonavir. This combination should be taken twice daily (BID) for five consecutive days. Treatment should begin as soon as possible after a COVID-19 diagnosis and within five days of symptom onset.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for mild or moderate impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B).  Use is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) due to safety concerns.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥60 to <90 mL/min). For moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min), a reduced dose of 150 mg Nirmatrelvir and 100 mg Ritonavir BID for 5 days is recommended.  Use is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min).


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Diarrhea
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works
Nirmatrelvir directly inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a crucial enzyme the virus needs to replicate. By blocking Mpro, Nirmatrelvir prevents the virus from producing the proteins it needs to multiply.  Ritonavir is included in the combination not to directly fight the virus, but to act as a booster. It inhibits the metabolism of Nirmatrelvir, thus increasing its levels in the body and prolonging its effectiveness.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with a history of significant hypersensitivity reactions (like toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to Nirmatrelvir, Ritonavir, or any components of the medication. It should also be avoided with certain medications that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance or are potent CYP3A inducers, as this could lead to dangerous drug interactions.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with many other drugs, increasing the risk of side effects. It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The risk of major birth defects associated with Nirmatrelvir has not been fully evaluated.  The use of Ritonavir in pregnancy has not shown an increased risk of birth defects, but COVID-19 itself poses risks to both mother and fetus.  It is unknown whether Nirmatrelvir is excreted in breast milk. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing liver disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with moderate renal impairment.  Use is not recommended for those with severe renal or hepatic impairment.
