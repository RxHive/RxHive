# Niacinamide

**Generic Name:** Niacinamide (also known as nicotinamide)

**Usage:**

* **Skincare:**  Topical application of niacinamide is widely used to treat various skin concerns, including acne, redness, inflammation, large pores, uneven skin tone (hyperpigmentation), and dryness. It's often included in serums, moisturizers, cleansers, and toners.
* **Oral Supplementation:**  Oral niacinamide is primarily used to treat pellagra (a deficiency disease caused by a lack of niacin), but it's also sometimes used for other conditions like high cholesterol and diabetes.  However, oral use requires medical supervision due to potential side effects.

**Side Effects:**

* **Topical:**  Generally well-tolerated.  Mild side effects can include redness, itching, or dryness, especially at higher concentrations or with sensitive skin.  These are usually temporary and subside with continued use or reducing the concentration.
* **Oral:**  Can cause flushing (redness and warmth in the face, neck, and chest), itching, nausea, vomiting, liver damage (rare but serious), and elevated blood sugar.  These side effects are more common with higher doses of nicotinic acid (a different form of niacin) than with niacinamide.  Consult a doctor before taking oral niacinamide, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.

**How it Works:**

* **Skincare:** Niacinamide acts as a multi-tasker in skincare. It strengthens the skin barrier by increasing ceramide production, reduces inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory pathways, controls sebum production to help with acne, improves skin elasticity, shrinks pore size, and reduces hyperpigmentation by inhibiting melanin transfer.
* **Oral:** Niacinamide is a form of vitamin B3 (niacin) which is crucial for various metabolic processes in the body.  It plays a role in DNA repair, cell signaling, and energy production.  Its mechanism in treating high cholesterol and diabetes involves improving lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

**FAQs:**

* **Is niacinamide safe for sensitive skin?**  Generally, yes, but start with a low concentration (2-5%) and gradually increase as tolerated.  Always perform a patch test before applying to the entire face.
* **Can I use niacinamide with other skincare products?**  Yes, but avoid combining it with strong actives like vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid) and AHAs/BHAs simultaneously, as this can cause irritation.  It's best to alternate their application times.
* **What concentration of niacinamide should I use?**  Concentrations ranging from 2-10% are commonly used in skincare products.  Higher concentrations may not necessarily be more effective and can increase the risk of irritation.
* **How often should I use niacinamide?**  Most people can use niacinamide once or twice daily, depending on their skin type and tolerance.
* **Does niacinamide cause purging?**  While uncommon, some individuals may experience a temporary increase in breakouts when first starting niacinamide.  This is usually short-lived as the skin adjusts.
* **What's the difference between niacinamide and nicotinic acid?**  Both are forms of vitamin B3, but nicotinic acid is more likely to cause flushing, while niacinamide generally has fewer side effects.
