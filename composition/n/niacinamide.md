# Niacinamide
### Generic Name
Niacinamide

### Usage

Niacinamide, a form of vitamin B3, is primarily used to prevent and treat pellagra, a serious disease caused by niacin deficiency.  Symptoms of pellagra include dermatitis (skin inflammation), diarrhea, dementia, and ultimately death if left untreated. While niacinamide's primary role is in pellagra treatment,  research suggests potential benefits in other conditions, though more data is needed to confirm these uses.  These include:

* **Acne:**  Some studies indicate it may improve acne by reducing inflammation and sebum production.
* **Rosacea:**  Similar to acne, it may help manage rosacea symptoms.
* **Autoimmune blistering disorders:**  Preliminary research suggests a potential role in treating certain autoimmune skin conditions.
* **Aging skin:**  It's often found in skincare products, believed to improve skin texture and reduce wrinkles.
* **Atopic dermatitis (Eczema):**  Shows promise in reducing inflammation and improving skin barrier function.

It's crucial to note that the effectiveness of niacinamide in these conditions beyond pellagra is still under investigation, and further research is necessary to establish definitive efficacy.  It is important to consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual's age and health.  The following information is for general guidance only and should not be considered medical advice:

**Pellagra (off-label use for conditions other than pellagra):**

* **Adults:**  Treatment typically starts with 100mg every 6 hours for several days (or until significant symptom improvement), followed by a lower maintenance dose of 50mg every 8-12 hours until skin lesions heal.
* **Children:** The dosage is typically lower, ranging from 10-50mg every 6 hours until symptoms improve.  A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dose based on the child's age and weight.

**Important Note:**  Dosage for conditions other than pellagra are not yet established and should be determined by a qualified healthcare professional.  This information provided above for pellagra should only be used under the direct supervision of a doctor.  


### Side Effects

While generally well-tolerated, niacinamide can cause some side effects, although the frequency isn't always well-defined in studies. Common side effects can include:

* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Flatulence (gas)
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Itching

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Niacinamide serves as a source of niacin in the body. Niacin is a crucial component of two coenzymes (NAD and NADP) vital for various metabolic processes. These coenzymes participate in:

* **Tissue respiration:** The process of energy production in cells.
* **Lipid metabolism:** The breakdown and utilization of fats.
* **Glycogenolysis:** The breakdown of glycogen (stored glucose) for energy.

Unlike some other forms of niacin, niacinamide lacks the vasodilating (blood vessel widening) effects that can lead to flushing.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Niacinamide is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to niacin, niacinamide, or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Niacinamide may increase the risk of side effects when taken with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering medications.  Careful monitoring is necessary if used concurrently.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Niacinamide is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken in recommended doses. However, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional.
* **Other Precautions:** Niacinamide can cause false elevations in urinary catecholamines (stress hormones) in some lab tests.  This should be considered when interpreting test results.


### FAQs

**Q: Is niacinamide the same as niacin?**

A: Niacinamide is a form of niacin (vitamin B3), but they have different properties. Niacin can cause flushing, while niacinamide generally does not.

**Q: How should I store niacinamide?**

A: Store niacinamide supplements according to the instructions on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I take niacinamide without a doctor's prescription?**

A: For preventing and treating pellagra, medical supervision is crucial. For other potential uses, consult a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage and monitor for any side effects.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A: If you experience any adverse reactions, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.
