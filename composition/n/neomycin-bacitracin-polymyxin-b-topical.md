# Neomycin + Bacitracin + Polymyxin B (Topical)
### Generic Name
Neomycin + Bacitracin + Polymyxin B (Topical)

### Usage
Neomycin + Bacitracin + Polymyxin B topical ointment is a combination antibiotic used to prevent and treat superficial bacterial skin infections.  This includes minor wounds like cuts, scrapes, and abrasions, as well as preventing infection in areas like skin graft donor sites and surgical sutures. It's also helpful in managing skin conditions that have become secondarily infected (meaning a bacterial infection has developed on top of another skin problem).  This medication is for external use only and should not be used for deep wounds, animal bites, or serious burns.

### Dosage
**Adult and Pediatric (over 2 years):** For prevention or treatment of topical infections, apply a small amount of ointment (approximately the size of the tip of your finger) to the affected area 1 to 3 times daily.  A sterile bandage may be used to cover the treated area if needed.  

**Pediatric (under 2 years):**  This combination is not recommended for use in infants and children under 2 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment, likely due to the low systemic absorption of this topical medication. However, for patients with renal (kidney) impairment, dose reduction might be necessary; consult a healthcare provider for guidance.


### Side Effects
* **Common:** Redness, itching, swelling, irritation at the application site, allergic contact dermatitis.  Failure of the wound to heal as expected may also occur.
* **Serious (Less Common):**  Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially a severe allergic reaction, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
This triple antibiotic ointment contains three different antibiotics that work in distinct ways to combat bacterial infections:

* **Neomycin (aminoglycoside):**  Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacteria from producing the proteins needed for survival and reproduction.
* **Bacitracin (polypeptide):** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, stopping bacteria from building and maintaining their protective outer layer.
* **Polymyxin B (polypeptide):** Damages the bacterial cell membrane, leading to leakage of essential cellular components and bacterial death.

By combining these three antibiotics with different mechanisms of action, the ointment provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria commonly causing skin infections.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Do not use if you are allergic to neomycin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, or any other component of the ointment.  Also avoid use if you have pre-existing nerve deafness.
* **Warnings:** Prolonged use may increase the risk of superinfection (a new infection caused by a different organism). Use with caution in elderly patients and individuals with impaired kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is categorized as pregnancy category C. The excretion of these antibiotics into breast milk is unknown; therefore, use with caution during breastfeeding. Consult your doctor before using during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes. Do not use on deep wounds, animal bites, or serious burns.  Do not apply other topical products to the treated area.  If symptoms persist or worsen after one week of use, seek medical attention.  This medication is for external use only.

* **Q: How long can I use this ointment?** A:  Generally, use for no more than one week unless directed otherwise by a healthcare professional. If your condition doesn't improve or worsens, consult a doctor.
* **Q: Can I use this on my face?** A: While it can be used on the face, use caution and avoid contact with eyes.  If you have any concerns, consult a doctor.
