# Nedocromil (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Nedocromil (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Nedocromil ophthalmic solution is primarily used to treat the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane covering the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids) caused by an allergic reaction.  This medication helps relieve the uncomfortable itching that is a common symptom.


### Dosage

**Allergic Conjunctivitis:**

* **Adults and Children ≥3 years:** The usual dose is 1-2 drops of the 2% ophthalmic solution in each affected eye twice daily (BID).  This should be continued throughout the period of exposure to the allergen.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, adjustments may not be necessary due to the low systemic absorption of nedocromil when administered ophthalmically.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Unpleasant taste
* Burning, irritation, or stinging sensation in the eyes
* Nasal congestion


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Conjunctivitis
* Eye redness
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to light)
* Asthma (in rare cases)
* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Nedocromil ophthalmic solution is a mast cell stabilizer.  Mast cells are immune cells that release substances like histamine and leukotrienes when triggered by allergens. These substances cause the inflammation and itching characteristic of allergic conjunctivitis. Nedocromil works by preventing the release of these inflammatory mediators from mast cells and other inflammatory cells, thus reducing the allergic reaction and its symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nedocromil is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to nedocromil or any component of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Nedocromil is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  While there are no known adverse effects in animal studies, the safety in pregnant women hasn't been fully established.  The excretion of nedocromil in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution is advised when using this medication during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  This medication is for ophthalmic (eye) use only.  Avoid touching the tip of the container to the eye, eyelids, or any other surface to prevent contamination.  If you wear contact lenses, it's generally recommended to remove them before administering the drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
