# Nifedipine
### Generic Name
Nifedipine

### Usage
Nifedipine is primarily used to treat chronic stable angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart) and vasospastic angina (chest pain caused by spasms in the coronary arteries).  It's also employed to manage hypertension (high blood pressure), but primarily with extended-release formulations.  Importantly,  Nifedipine has several off-label uses, including the treatment of anal fissures, high-altitude pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and Raynaud's phenomenon.  These off-label uses should be discussed with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release), and the patient's individual characteristics.  Always follow a doctor's prescription precisely.  The following information is for general understanding and should not substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension (Extended-release):**  Initial dose typically starts at 30-60 mg once daily, adjusted as needed over 7-14 days, with a maximum dose of 120 mg/day or 90 mg/day depending on the specific product.

* **Stable/Variant Angina (Immediate-release):** Initial dose is usually 10 mg three times daily (TID), increased as needed up to 10-30 mg TID or four times daily (QID) with a maximum of 180 mg/day.  In hospitalized patients under close monitoring, higher doses might be used to manage pain and arrhythmias related to ischemia (lack of blood flow).

* **Stable/Variant Angina (Extended-release):** Initial dose typically starts at 30-60 mg once daily, adjusted as needed over 7-14 days, with a maximum dose of 120 mg/day.

* **Anal Fissures (Topical, Off-label):**  Usually, a 0.2% gel or ointment is applied twice daily for 3-6 weeks.

* **High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (Off-label):** Prevention usually involves 30 mg twice daily starting 24 hours before ascent and continuing for five days after reaching maximum altitude, potentially longer if deemed necessary by a physician. Treatment involves the same dosage.

* **Pulmonary Hypertension (Off-label):** Starts at 30 mg twice daily, with cautious dose increases to 120-240 mg/day.

* **Raynaud's Phenomenon (Off-label):** Extended-release: Initial dose is 30 mg daily, increased gradually if needed; immediate-release is usually reserved for short-term use in hospitalized patients under close observation due to rapid onset of effects and risk of adverse events.


**Children:** Dosages for children are significantly lower than adult doses and are strictly determined by a physician based on weight and condition.  There are formulations and dosing recommendations for specific pediatric conditions like hypertension and high-altitude pulmonary edema.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Nausea
* Heartburn


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Palpitations
* Fast heart rate
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling)
* Liver problems


**If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.**

### How it Works

Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker.  Calcium ions play a critical role in the contraction of heart and blood vessel muscles. Nifedipine works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into these muscle cells. This relaxation of blood vessels leads to reduced blood pressure and improved blood flow, particularly in the coronary arteries, relieving angina symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nifedipine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, severe hypotension, cardiovascular shock, and certain other conditions.  Always inform your doctor about any allergies or existing medical conditions.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Nifedipine can interact with numerous other medications, including other antihypertensives, CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., grapefruit juice, ketoconazole), and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin).  Disclose all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies to your doctor.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nifedipine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against potential risks. It is excreted in breast milk and should be used cautiously during breastfeeding.

* **Specific Populations:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney impairment, though specific guidelines may not always be explicitly stated in drug literature. Close monitoring is essential.  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to its effects.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Nifedipine with other medications?** A:  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Nifedipine?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Nifedipine suddenly?** A: No, sudden discontinuation can lead to rebound angina or worsening blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Nifedipine?** A: No, grapefruit juice interacts with Nifedipine and should be avoided.
