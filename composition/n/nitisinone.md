# Nitisinone
### Generic Name
Nitisinone

### Usage
Nitisinone is primarily used to treat hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1).  HT-1 is a rare inherited metabolic disorder where the body can't properly break down tyrosine, an amino acid. This leads to a buildup of toxic substances that damage the liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Nitisinone works by inhibiting an enzyme involved in tyrosine breakdown, thus preventing the accumulation of these harmful substances.  It's crucial to understand that nitisinone is always used in conjunction with a strict diet that restricts tyrosine and phenylalanine intake.  This dietary restriction is essential to manage the condition effectively and prevent further complications.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Nitisinone must be used with a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine. Dosage adjustments are based on individual biochemical and clinical responses, not solely on plasma tyrosine levels.  The goal is to maintain succinylacetone levels within a safe range.

**Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1 (HT-1):**

* **Adults:** The initial oral dose is typically 0.5 mg/kg twice daily (BID). This may be increased to 0.75 mg/kg BID if succinylacetone is detectable after four weeks.  Further increases might be necessary, depending on other biochemical markers.  If serum and urine succinylacetone are undetectable after at least four weeks of treatment, the dose might be given once daily (OD) at 1-2 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose is 2 mg/kg.

* **Children and Adolescents:** The initial oral dose is also 0.5 mg/kg BID. Dosage is titrated based on individual biochemical markers (plasma and urine succinylacetone levels, liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein levels) and clinical response.  If succinylacetone is still detectable after one month, the dose may be increased to 0.75 mg/kg BID, with further increases possible up to a maximum of 1 mg/kg BID.  For children 5 years and older using capsules or oral suspension, once-daily dosing (1-2 mg/kg OD) may be considered after at least four weeks of stable, undetectable serum and urine succinylacetone levels. The maximum daily dose remains 2 mg/kg.

**Dosage Forms:** Nitisinone is available in tablets, capsules, and oral suspension.  Administration instructions vary slightly depending on the form.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Consult your healthcare provider for guidance in these situations.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Increased plasma tyrosine levels
* Alopecia (hair loss)

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin rash)
* Maculopapular rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Xeroderma (dry skin)
* Porphyria (disorder affecting heme production)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Granulocytopenia (low granulocyte count)
* Hepatic failure (liver failure)
* Hepatic neoplasm (liver tumor)
* Ocular symptoms (conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, keratitis, photophobia, blepharitis, cataract, eye pain)
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)

**Other less frequent side effects reported include:** abdominal pain, brain disorders, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, headache, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), hyperkinesia (excessive movement), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), increased liver enzymes, melena (black, tarry stools), seizures, and septicemia (blood infection).

**Important:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Nitisinone works by competitively inhibiting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme crucial in the breakdown of tyrosine.  In individuals with HT-1, this enzyme's deficiency leads to the buildup of toxic byproducts. By blocking this enzyme, nitisinone reduces the production of these harmful substances, lessening their damaging effects on the liver, kidneys, and other organs.  Because nitisinone inhibits tyrosine metabolism, it results in elevated tyrosine levels in the blood, hence the importance of dietary restrictions of tyrosine and phenylalanine to counter this effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nitisinone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components. Breastfeeding is also contraindicated while using nitisinone.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nitisinone may interact with other medications, affecting their levels or efficacy. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered due to limited data.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated.  Infants exposed to nitisinone in utero should be closely monitored.
* **Specific Populations:**  Children and older adults may require close monitoring and dose adjustments.  Individuals with liver or kidney problems might also need special consideration.
* **Dietary Restrictions:** Strict adherence to the prescribed diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine is crucial for the effectiveness and safety of nitisinone.  Nutritional consultation is recommended.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood tests (including complete blood count, liver function tests, plasma tyrosine levels, and succinylacetone levels), as well as regular eye exams, are necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take nitisinone?** A:  Nitisinone is typically a long-term medication. The duration depends on individual response and the overall management of HT-1.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nitisinone suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking nitisinone without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation may lead to a worsening of the condition.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store nitisinone?** A: Store nitisinone as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Are there any specific foods I should avoid while taking nitisinone?** A: Yes, you should strictly adhere to the prescribed diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can provide a detailed dietary plan.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially severe ones.
