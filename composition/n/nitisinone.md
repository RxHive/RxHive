# Nitisinone

**Generic Name:** Nitisinone

**Usage:**

Nitisinone is used to treat hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HT1).  It's a crucial medication for managing this rare genetic disorder by reducing the buildup of harmful substances in the body.  Specifically, it inhibits the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), which is involved in the tyrosine metabolic pathway.  By inhibiting HPPD, nitisinone prevents the formation of succinylacetone, a toxic metabolite that accumulates in HT1 and causes serious organ damage.  It is typically used in conjunction with a specific diet to further manage the condition.

**Side Effects:**

Nitisinone can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  The frequency and severity vary between individuals. Common side effects may include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively frequent side effects, often manageable with appropriate anti-emetic medication.
* **Diarrhea:**  Similar to nausea and vomiting, this can be managed.
* **Fatigue:**  A general feeling of tiredness or weakness.
* **Skin rash:** Allergic reactions, though uncommon, can manifest as rashes.
* **Increased risk of photosensitivity:**  Increased sensitivity to sunlight, necessitating sun protection measures.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  This indicates potential liver stress and requires monitoring.

Serious side effects, though less common, include:

* **Keratitis:** Inflammation of the cornea (the transparent outer layer of the eye), requiring ophthalmological attention.
* **Hepatic encephalopathy:** A complication of liver failure affecting brain function.
* **Renal complications:** Issues related to kidney function.
* **Cardiomyopathy:**  Disease affecting the heart muscle.

It's crucial to report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Nitisinone works by inhibiting the enzyme HPPD.  In individuals with HT1, a deficiency in the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, including succinylacetone.  HPPD is involved in the tyrosine metabolic pathway upstream of FAH. By inhibiting HPPD, nitisinone reduces the production of the substrates that would normally be converted into succinylacetone, thus lowering the levels of this harmful metabolite. This significantly reduces the damage to the liver, kidneys, and other organs.

**FAQs:**

* **Is nitisinone a cure for HT1?** No, nitisinone is not a cure. It is a treatment that manages the symptoms and complications of HT1 and helps prevent further organ damage.  Lifelong treatment is usually required.

* **What is the typical dosage of nitisinone?** The dosage varies depending on the individual's age, weight, and response to treatment.  It's determined and adjusted by a physician specializing in metabolic disorders.

* **What are the necessary precautions while taking nitisinone?**  Regular monitoring of liver function and other organ systems is vital.  Patients need to be aware of potential side effects and should adhere to a specific diet prescribed by their doctor.  Adequate sun protection is essential.

* **Are there any drug interactions with nitisinone?**  Yes, there can be interactions with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice on missed doses.  Do not attempt to double up on doses.
