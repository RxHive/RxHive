# Nalidixic Acid

**Generic Name:** Nalidixic Acid

**Usage:** Nalidixic acid is an older antibiotic primarily used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria, such as *Escherichia coli* and *Proteus mirabilis*.  It's generally reserved for cases where other, more effective antibiotics are not suitable or tolerated.  Its use has significantly decreased due to the emergence of resistant strains and the availability of better alternatives.

**Side Effects:**  Nalidixic acid can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  These include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), and rash.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumor cerebri), particularly in children,  blood disorders (hemolytic anemia, neutropenia), seizures, and liver damage.  Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.


**How it Works:** Nalidixic acid is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for DNA replication and repair.  By blocking this enzyme, nalidixic acid prevents bacterial cells from reproducing and ultimately leads to their death.  Its mechanism of action differs slightly from newer fluoroquinolones, resulting in a narrower spectrum of activity.

**FAQs:**

* **Is nalidixic acid still used frequently?** No. Due to the development of widespread bacterial resistance and the availability of safer and more effective antibiotics, nalidixic acid is rarely used as a first-line treatment for UTIs.  It may be considered in very specific situations where other antibiotics are ineffective or contraindicated.

* **What are the precautions before taking nalidixic acid?**  Patients with impaired kidney function, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or a history of seizures should use caution.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should also be discussed with a doctor before using nalidixic acid.

* **How long should I take nalidixic acid?**  The duration of treatment is determined by a doctor based on the severity of the infection and the patient's response to therapy.  Itâ€™s crucial to complete the prescribed course, even if symptoms improve, to prevent the development of resistant bacteria.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any severe or unusual side effects, stop taking nalidixic acid and contact your doctor immediately.  Minor side effects such as nausea or mild diarrhea may resolve on their own, but consult your doctor if they persist or worsen.

* **Can I take nalidixic acid with other medications?**  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking. Nalidixic acid may interact with other drugs, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.
