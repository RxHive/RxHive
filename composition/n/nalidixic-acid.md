# Nalidixic Acid
### Generic Name
Nalidixic Acid

### Usage
Nalidixic acid is an antibacterial medication primarily used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) and some gastrointestinal infections caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria.  It's particularly effective against bacteria like *Escherichia coli* and *Proteus mirabilis*, common culprits in UTIs.  While it *can* be used for gastrointestinal infections, its efficacy is less consistent compared to its use in UTIs, and other antibiotics are often preferred for these infections.  The use of nalidixic acid has declined in recent years due to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains and the availability of broader-spectrum and more effective antibiotics.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical adult dose is 1 gram (1000 mg) orally every six hours for at least seven days for acute infections. For chronic infections, the dose may be reduced to 500 mg every six hours.

**Children (over 3 months old):** The dosage for children is calculated based on their weight, typically 50-55 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into four doses (every six hours).  For chronic infections, this may be reduced to 30-33 mg/kg/day divided into four doses.  **Nalidixic acid is contraindicated in infants under 3 months of age.**

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic (liver) impairment, but caution is advised due to reduced metabolism. For renal (kidney) impairment, if creatinine clearance (CrCl) is greater than 20 mL/min, no adjustment is usually necessary. However, if CrCl is 20 mL/min or less, the dose should be reduced by 50%.  Always consult a healthcare provider for appropriate dosage adjustments based on individual patient factors.

### Side Effects
**Common side effects:**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain


**Less common, but serious side effects:**

* Hemolytic anemia (breakdown of red blood cells)
* Increased intracranial pressure
* Seizures
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Allergic reactions (including angioedema and anaphylaxis)
* Tendon inflammation or rupture
* Metabolic acidosis


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Nalidixic acid is a quinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial DNA replication.  Specifically, it targets and blocks the action of DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for unwinding and replicating bacterial DNA. By preventing DNA replication, nalidixic acid effectively stops the bacteria from multiplying and allows the body's immune system to clear the infection.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Nalidixic acid is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to nalidixic acid or related compounds, infants under 3 months old, patients with porphyria (a genetic disorder affecting heme production), those with a history of seizures, breastfeeding women, and pregnant women during the first trimester.
* **Interactions:** Nalidixic acid can interact with several other medications, including anticoagulants (like warfarin), antiarrhythmics, theophylline, and probenecid.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting nalidixic acid.  Taking antacids, multivitamins, or certain other medications within two hours of nalidixic acid can reduce its absorption.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, CNS disorders, G6PD deficiency (a genetic condition affecting red blood cells),  and the elderly.  Avoid excessive sun exposure while taking nalidixic acid due to the risk of photosensitivity.  The medication may cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for nalidixic acid to work?** A:  Improvement in symptoms usually begins within a few days, but a full course of treatment is essential to eliminate the infection.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nalidixic acid once I feel better?** A: No, completing the prescribed course is crucial to prevent the bacteria from becoming resistant to the medication and to ensure the infection is fully eradicated.

* **Q: How should I store nalidixic acid?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Is nalidixic acid safe during pregnancy?** A:  Nalidixic acid is generally avoided during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.  Consult your doctor to discuss alternative treatment options if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.
