# Neomycin

**Generic Name:** Neomycin

**Usage:** Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used topically (on the skin) and occasionally orally (though less common due to significant side effects).  Its topical uses include treating bacterial skin infections like impetigo, infected wounds, and burns.  Oral use is largely restricted to bowel preparation before surgery or colonoscopy (though this is becoming less frequent due to safer alternatives).

**Side Effects:**

* **Topical:**  Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site are common.  Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling) are possible, though less frequent. Prolonged or excessive use can lead to skin thinning or irritation.
* **Oral:**  Oral neomycin carries significantly more risks.  The most serious side effect is nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) and ototoxicity (hearing loss or damage to the inner ear).  Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are also common.  Absorption from the gut is typically low, but significant absorption can occur in patients with impaired kidney function.  Oral neomycin should only be used under strict medical supervision and rarely.


**How it Works:** Neomycin works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, interfering with protein synthesis. This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.  It is effective against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.

**FAQs:**

* **Is neomycin an antibiotic?** Yes, it's an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
* **Can I use neomycin on my face?**  While topical neomycin is available in some facial preparations, it's generally recommended to use it only as directed by a doctor due to potential for skin irritation and allergic reactions.
* **Can I use neomycin if I'm allergic to other antibiotics?**  Cross-allergenicity with other aminoglycosides (like gentamicin or streptomycin) is possible.  You should inform your doctor about any known allergies before using neomycin.
* **Is neomycin available over-the-counter?**  Topical neomycin preparations are sometimes available over-the-counter, often in combination with other medications. However, oral neomycin is only available with a prescription.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effectiveness of topical neomycin varies depending on the infection and its severity, but improvement should be seen within a few days.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Stop using neomycin and contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects, such as allergic reactions, significant skin irritation, or hearing problems.
