# Neomycin
### Generic Name
Neomycin

### Usage
Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic effective against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.  Its primary use is topical, meaning it's applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes.  It's commonly found in creams, ointments, and powders to treat bacterial skin infections such as impetigo, infected wounds, and burns.  It's also sometimes included in preparations for ear infections (otitis externa) and eye infections (conjunctivitis).  While less common due to potential systemic side effects, neomycin can be administered orally or intravenously for severe systemic infections, but this is usually reserved for situations where other antibiotics are ineffective.  However, systemic use is declining due to the availability of safer alternatives.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the route of administration, the specific condition being treated, and the patient's age and overall health.  There are no standardized pediatric oral or IV doses, as systemic use in children is generally avoided due to nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity risks.

**Topical:** The dosage for topical applications is determined by the specific product formulation.  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the affected area two to three times daily, or as directed by a healthcare professional.  The duration of treatment varies based on the severity and response to treatment.

**Oral (rare):**  Oral neomycin is rarely prescribed due to the risk of significant side effects.  Dosage, if prescribed, would be determined by the physician based on the severity of the infection and patient factors.  This route should only be considered when absolutely necessary.

**Intravenous (rare):** Intravenous neomycin is even more rarely used, and is typically reserved for life-threatening infections resistant to other antibiotics.  Dosage is strictly determined by a physician and is usually based on body weight and kidney function.  Continuous monitoring is crucial.

**Important Note:**  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or the medication labeling precisely.  Never increase the dose or frequency of application without consulting a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (Topical):**
* Mild skin irritation (redness, itching, burning)
* Allergic contact dermatitis (skin rash)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Systemic â€“ Oral and IV):**
* Hearing loss (ototoxicity)
* Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
* Neuromuscular blockade (muscle weakness)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, discontinue use immediately and consult a healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Neomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria.  It achieves this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacterial cells, interfering with protein synthesis essential for bacterial growth and survival.  By inhibiting protein synthesis, neomycin prevents bacterial reproduction and ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.  This mechanism is effective against a range of susceptible bacteria.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to aminoglycoside antibiotics should avoid neomycin.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Neomycin should be used with extreme caution (or avoided altogether) in patients with pre-existing kidney or liver disease due to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of neomycin during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a healthcare provider, as its safety in these situations has not been fully established.  The risk of potential harm to the fetus or infant must be weighed against the benefits of treatment.
* **Hearing Loss:**  Pre-existing hearing loss increases the risk of further hearing impairment with neomycin use.
* **Drug Interactions:** Neomycin can interact with other medications, such as neuromuscular blocking agents and diuretics.  Inform your physician about all medications you are taking before starting neomycin treatment.
* **Myasthenia Gravis:** Individuals with myasthenia gravis should avoid neomycin because it can worsen muscle weakness.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I use neomycin on open wounds?** A:  Topical neomycin can be used on some open wounds, but only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  They will assess the wound's severity and suitability for this treatment.
* **Q: How should I store neomycin?** A: Store neomycin at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I use neomycin if I am allergic to other antibiotics?** A: Allergic reactions to one aminoglycoside can increase the risk of allergic reactions to others. Consult a healthcare provider to determine a suitable alternative.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvements varies depending on the infection's severity and the type of application.  Improvement should be noticeable within a few days, but the full course of treatment should be completed.
* **Q:  What should I do if I accidentally ingest neomycin cream?** A: If you accidentally ingest neomycin cream, contact your healthcare provider or poison control immediately.
