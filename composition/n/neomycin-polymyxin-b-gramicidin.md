# Neomycin + Polymyxin B + Gramicidin
### Generic Name
Neomycin + Polymyxin B + Gramicidin

### Usage
This combination medication is an ophthalmic solution used for the short-term treatment of superficial external infections of the eye.  It's primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other similar infections affecting the outer surface of the eye.  It is not effective against viral or fungal infections.

### Dosage
**Ophthalmic Solution (Neomycin 1.75 mg/mL, Polymyxin B 10,000 units/mL, and Gramicidin 0.025 mg/mL):**

* **Adults and Children:** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 4 hours, or 2 drops every hour for severe infections. Treatment should typically last for 7-10 days.  The dosage is the same for both adults and children.  

**Administration Instructions:** Avoid touching the dropper tip to the eye or any surface to prevent contamination. After instillation, gently press on the inner corner of the eye (lacrimal sac) for a few seconds to minimize systemic absorption of the medication.


### Side Effects
* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or itching of the eye; temporary eye irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing),  worsening of the eye infection,  eye pain, blurred vision, or changes in vision.


**Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, stop using the medication and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
This triple antibiotic combination works by targeting bacterial growth in several ways:

* **Neomycin (Aminoglycoside):** Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacteria from producing essential proteins needed for survival.
* **Polymyxin B (Polypeptide):** Damages the bacterial cell membrane, leading to leakage of essential components and bacterial cell death.
* **Gramicidin (Polypeptide):**  Also disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, further enhancing the antibacterial effect.


By combining these three different mechanisms, the medication provides broader coverage against a range of bacteria commonly causing superficial eye infections.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Do not use this medication if you are allergic to neomycin, polymyxin B, gramicidin, or any other component of the formulation.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  The risk of developing allergic reactions (including sensitization to neomycin which can manifest as itching, redness, swelling, and delayed healing) increases with prolonged use.
* **Pre-existing Eye Conditions:** Use with caution if you have glaucoma, impaired vision, or other pre-existing eye conditions.  This medication may worsen these issues or interfere with their treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. While there is no established risk, it is recommended to use with caution in breastfeeding women.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other drugs. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) you are currently taking.
* **Prolonged Use:**  Extended use of this medication may increase the risk of developing secondary eye infections or other complications.  The course of treatment should not be exceeded unless directed by a physician.
