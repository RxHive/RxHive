# Naphazoline (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Naphazoline (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Naphazoline ophthalmic solution is primarily used to relieve redness in the eyes caused by minor irritations.  It provides temporary relief from burning and irritation associated with dry eyes and acts as a protectant against further irritation or dryness.  It's crucial to remember that naphazoline only treats the symptoms and not the underlying cause of eye redness or dryness.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For ocular congestion (as a decongestant), the usual dose is 1-2 drops of a 0.012%, 0.025%, or 0.1% solution into the affected eye(s) up to four times daily.  Treatment should not exceed three days.

**Children (aged 6 years and older):** For redness and irritation, the dose is typically 1-2 drops of a 0.012% to 0.03% solution into the affected eye up to four times daily.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance if you have liver or kidney disease.


**Important Note:**  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding dosage and frequency.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are not specifically listed in the manufacturer's labeling for naphazoline ophthalmic.  However, potential side effects associated with similar medications include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes
* Temporary blurred vision
* Eye irritation


Less common, but more serious side effects are rare but may include systemic effects if significant absorption occurs (unlikely with proper administration). These include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Decreased body temperature
* Drowsiness


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Naphazoline ophthalmic solution is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist.  It works by stimulating these receptors in the small blood vessels (arterioles) of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the scleraâ€”the white part of the eye), causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels). This narrowing reduces blood flow to the conjunctiva, thereby lessening the redness and relieving the associated discomfort.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Naphazoline ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to naphazoline or any component of the formulation, narrow-angle glaucoma, or anatomical narrow-angle.

* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular abnormalities, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, or ophthalmic infection or injury.

* **Drug Interactions:** Avoid concomitant use with ergot derivatives, iobenguane radiopharmaceutical products, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  Naphazoline may interact with several other medications. Consult a healthcare professional or pharmacist for a complete list of potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Naphazoline is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:**  This medication is for topical ophthalmic use only.  Avoid touching the tip of the container to any surface, eyelids, or surrounding areas. Remove contact lenses before administration, and apply gentle pressure to the lacrimal sac (the tear duct) for 1-2 minutes after instillation to minimize systemic absorption.  Discontinue use and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen, persist for more than 72 hours, or if systemic absorption symptoms (dizziness, headache, nausea, decreased body temperature, drowsiness) appear.
