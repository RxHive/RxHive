# Nabumetone
### Generic Name
Nabumetone

### Usage
Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, both acute and chronic.  It works by reducing inflammation, pain, and stiffness associated with these conditions. While its primary use is for arthritis,  it's important to note that nabumetone is not a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and doesn't alter the underlying disease process.  It only manages the symptoms.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  The typical starting dose is 1000 mg once daily.  This can be increased to a maximum of 2000 mg daily, divided into one or two doses, depending on individual response and the physician's assessment.  Doses exceeding 2000 mg haven't been extensively studied. Patients weighing less than 50 kg may not require doses greater than 1000 mg daily.  Nabumetone is available in tablet form.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of nabumetone in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's label doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment.  However,  use should be cautious as the drug's activation and metabolism rely on liver function, and this could be reduced in cases of severe liver disease. Close monitoring is necessary.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).
    * CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min: No adjustment is necessary.
    * CrCl 30-49 mL/min: Initial maximum dose of 750 mg once daily; maximum daily dose of 1500 mg.
    * CrCl < 30 mL/min: Initial maximum dose of 500 mg once daily; maximum daily dose of 1000 mg.
    * Hemodialysis: Nabumetone is not removed by hemodialysis.  The KDIGO 2012 guidelines for NSAIDs recommend temporarily discontinuing use in patients with eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m² who experience intercurrent illnesses increasing the risk of acute kidney injury. Use should be avoided in those with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m².


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea

* Abdominal pain


**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% or less, but warrant medical attention):**

* Occult blood in stools (blood in the stool not visible to the naked eye)
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)

**Rare but Severe Side Effects (Less than 1%, post-marketing reports, or case studies):**  A wide range of severe side effects are possible, including but not limited to:  serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, liver damage (hepatotoxicity), kidney problems (renal failure),  blood disorders (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia), cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), and serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Nabumetone is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form in the body.  This active form inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2. COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, nabumetone helps alleviate the symptoms of arthritis.  It's important to note that while the exact mechanism for its anti-inflammatory effects isn't fully understood, the COX inhibition is considered a primary factor.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nabumetone is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to nabumetone or other NSAIDs, active peptic ulcer disease, severe renal or hepatic impairment, patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and patients with complete or partial syndrome of nasal polyps.
* **Interactions:** Nabumetone can interact with many other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), ACE inhibitors, diuretics, lithium, and other NSAIDs.  This can lead to increased risk of bleeding, reduced effectiveness of other medications, or other adverse effects.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nabumetone is a pregnancy Category C drug, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully known.  Use during pregnancy, especially late in pregnancy, should be avoided due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Use during breastfeeding should also be carefully considered.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly individuals are more prone to experiencing side effects from NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney problems.  Close monitoring is needed.
* **Cardiovascular and Gastrointestinal Risk:**  Nabumetone, like other NSAIDs, carries an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events (heart attack, stroke) and serious gastrointestinal complications (bleeding, ulceration, perforation).  Patients with existing cardiovascular or gastrointestinal issues are at higher risk.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take nabumetone with alcohol?** A:  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking nabumetone, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Q: How should I store nabumetone?** A: Store nabumetone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking nabumetone abruptly?** A:  It's best to discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor before stopping nabumetone.  Abrupt cessation may not be advisable.
* **Q:  Is nabumetone habit-forming?** A: No, nabumetone is not a controlled substance and is not considered habit-forming.
