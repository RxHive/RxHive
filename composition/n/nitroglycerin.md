# Nitroglycerin

**Generic Name:** Nitroglycerin

**Usage:**

Nitroglycerin is primarily used to treat angina (chest pain) caused by coronary artery disease.  It's used both to prevent angina attacks (prophylactically) and to treat attacks as they occur (acutely).  It can be administered in several forms:

* **Sublingual tablets or spray:**  Used for acute angina relief, placed under the tongue to be quickly absorbed.
* **Oral tablets or capsules:** Used for long-term prophylaxis of angina.
* **Ointment:** Applied to the skin for long-term prophylaxis.
* **Transdermal patches:** Applied to the skin for long-term prophylaxis.
* **Intravenous infusion:** Used in hospital settings for severe angina or other cardiovascular conditions.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of nitroglycerin include:

* Headache (often a mild, throbbing headache, frequently the most common side effect)
* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Flushing (redness of the face and neck)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension) which can cause fainting or dizziness
* Nausea
* Rapid heart rate (tachycardia - paradoxically, in some cases)


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Severe hypotension
* Increased intracranial pressure
* Allergic reactions


**How it Works:**

Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes and widens blood vessels.  Specifically, it works by releasing nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, within the smooth muscle cells of blood vessel walls.  This leads to:

* **Reduced preload:**  Decreased blood returning to the heart, reducing the heart's workload.
* **Reduced afterload:**  Decreased resistance to blood flow out of the heart, reducing the heart's workload.
* **Increased blood flow to the heart muscle:** This improves oxygen supply to the heart, relieving angina pain.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?** Sublingual nitroglycerin works within minutes, while other forms take longer to become effective.
* **How many tablets/sprays can I take?**  Always follow your doctor's instructions.  If chest pain persists after taking one sublingual tablet or spray, you can take another one in 5 minutes.  If pain continues, seek immediate medical attention. Do not exceed the prescribed dosage.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking nitroglycerin?** Alcohol can enhance the hypotensive effects of nitroglycerin and should be avoided or limited, particularly during initial treatment.  Discuss this with your doctor.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects often subside.  If side effects are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.
* **Can I take nitroglycerin with other medications?** Some medications can interact with nitroglycerin.  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **How should I store nitroglycerin?** Store nitroglycerin in a cool, dry place, away from light and heat.  Sublingual tablets can lose their effectiveness over time, so pay attention to expiration dates.
* **What if I forget a dose?** If you forget a dose of your long-acting nitroglycerin, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
