# Naltrexone

**Generic Name:** Naltrexone

**Usage:**

Naltrexone is used to treat alcohol dependence and opioid dependence.  For alcohol dependence, it's used as part of a comprehensive treatment program that includes counseling and support.  For opioid dependence, it helps reduce cravings and prevent relapse after detoxification. It's also sometimes used to treat compulsive eating disorders and some other impulse control disorders, although this is less common and not as widely supported by evidence.  Prescription is crucial; it should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Abdominal cramps
* Anxiety
* Insomnia
* Depression

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Liver damage (rare but serious; regular liver function tests may be required)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Severe abdominal pain
* Changes in mental health (worsening of depression or anxiety)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior


**How it Works:**

Naltrexone works by blocking the effects of opioid drugs and alcohol on the brain.  Specifically, it acts as an opioid receptor antagonist, meaning it prevents opioid drugs (like heroin, morphine, and codeine) from binding to opioid receptors in the brain. This reduces the pleasurable effects of these substances, reducing cravings and the risk of relapse.  The mechanism of action for alcohol dependence is less clear but is thought to involve modulation of brain reward systems and potentially other neurotransmitters.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Naltrexone if I'm still using opioids or alcohol?** No.  You must be completely detoxified from opioids and alcohol before starting Naltrexone.  Taking it while still using these substances can lead to serious withdrawal symptoms.  Your doctor will need to monitor you carefully during the detoxification process.

* **How long do I need to take Naltrexone?** The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual and their specific needs. Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration.

* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Naltrexone can interact with several medications, including opioids (even those used for pain relief), certain antidepressants, and some other drugs.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **What are the withdrawal symptoms if I stop taking Naltrexone?**  Withdrawal symptoms from naltrexone itself are generally mild if the medication is stopped gradually.  However, stopping naltrexone without medical supervision increases the risk of relapse for opioid or alcohol dependence.

* **Is Naltrexone addictive?**  Naltrexone itself is not considered addictive.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.  Consistency in taking Naltrexone as prescribed is important for its effectiveness.
