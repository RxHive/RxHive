# Naltrexone
### Generic Name
Naltrexone

### Usage

Naltrexone is primarily used to treat alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder.  It works by blocking the effects of opioids in the brain, reducing cravings and the rewarding effects associated with alcohol and opioid use.  While its primary use is in treating substance use disorders, it has also been used off-label for managing cholestatic pruritus (severe itching related to liver dysfunction).  However, the use of naltrexone for cholestatic pruritus should only be considered under the strict supervision of a physician due to potential side effects.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration (oral or intramuscular injection).  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and route strictly.

**Alcohol Use Disorder:**

* **Oral:** The typical starting dose is 50 mg once daily. Some individuals may require a higher dose (up to 100 mg daily), or alternative maintenance schedules (e.g., 50 mg on weekdays and 100 mg on weekends).  Higher doses increase the risk of liver damage.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** 380 mg once every 4 weeks.  This extended-release injection provides a sustained therapeutic effect.

**Opioid Use Disorder:**

* **Oral:** Treatment usually begins with a low dose of 25 mg. If withdrawal symptoms are not significant, this is increased to 50 mg daily. Alternative maintenance schedules similar to those used for alcohol use disorder may also be employed, but increased risk of liver issues exists with higher dosages and less frequent administrations.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** 380 mg once every 4 weeks.


**Cholestatic Pruritus (Off-Label):**

* **Oral:**  Treatment starts with a low dose of 12.5 mg once daily and is gradually increased (by 12.5 mg every 3-7 days) until the desired effect is achieved.  The maximum dose is typically 50 mg daily for up to 28 weeks.


**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of naltrexone in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for patients with liver or kidney impairment may be necessary, and should be determined with careful monitoring by a physician.  Naltrexone is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys; compromised function in these organs can lead to increased risk of adverse events.  Always consult your doctor before adjusting your dosage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Insomnia
* Anxiety
* Abdominal pain
* Changes in appetite
* Fatigue

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) - This is particularly important to watch for, especially with higher doses and less frequent administrations.
* Depression
* Suicidal thoughts
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Injection site reactions (with IM administration)

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the effects of opioids (like heroin, morphine, and other similar substances, as well as endorphins) at their receptor sites in the brain and elsewhere in the body.  By preventing these opioids from binding to their receptors, naltrexone reduces the rewarding effects associated with their use, helping to reduce cravings and prevent relapse.  With alcohol, naltrexone appears to influence the brain's reward pathways and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, thus reducing alcohol's reinforcing effects and curbing consumption.


### Precautions

* **Opioid Dependence:** Naltrexone is contraindicated in individuals currently using opioids or those physically dependent on them.  Initiating treatment without proper detoxification could lead to severe withdrawal symptoms.  A naloxone challenge test may be employed to assess opioid-free status.
* **Liver Disease:** Naltrexone should be used cautiously in patients with liver impairment, as it can cause liver damage. Regular liver function tests are recommended.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Patients with kidney problems should also be monitored carefully due to the route of excretion.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Drug Interactions:** Naltrexone can interact with other medications, including some pain relievers and other drugs. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.
* **Suicidal Thoughts:** Patients should be monitored for signs of depression or suicidal ideation.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking naltrexone for alcohol use disorder?** A: No.  Drinking alcohol while on naltrexone may not prevent intoxication, and combining alcohol with naltrexone may pose health risks.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you are taking oral naltrexone, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once. For the IM version, consult your physician immediately as soon as you realize you have missed a dose.
* **Q: How should I store naltrexone?** A: Store naltrexone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I stop taking naltrexone suddenly?** A: No, stopping naltrexone abruptly is not recommended; always follow your physician's guidance on tapering off the medication to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms or other complications.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A:  Signs include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
