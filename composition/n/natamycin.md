# Natamycin

**Generic Name:** Natamycin

**Usage:**

Natamycin is an antifungal medication used to treat a variety of fungal infections, primarily affecting the eyes and digestive system.  Specific uses include:

* **Fungal keratitis:**  A serious infection of the cornea (the clear front part of the eye).
* **Other superficial ocular fungal infections:** Infections of the eye's surface.
* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):** A fungal infection of the mouth and throat, often seen in immunocompromised individuals.
* (Less common) Treatment of certain food products to prevent fungal spoilage.  This use is mainly in the manufacturing setting and not directly applicable to human self-treatment.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, especially when used topically in the eye.  Possible side effects include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rarely, more severe allergic reactions can occur.
* **Gastrointestinal effects (when used orally):** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (though less common than with other oral antifungals).
* **Local irritation (topical):**  At the site of application, such as mild skin irritation.


**How it Works:**

Natamycin works by binding to sterols in the fungal cell membrane.  This binding disrupts the membrane's structure and function, ultimately leading to the death of the fungal cells.  It is selectively toxic to fungi, meaning it has minimal effect on human cells.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Natamycin available over-the-counter?**  No, Natamycin is typically only available with a prescription from a doctor or ophthalmologist.
* **How is Natamycin administered?**  This depends on the infection being treated.  For eye infections, it is usually applied as eye drops or ointment. For oral thrush, it may be administered as a suspension or lozenge.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the infection's severity and location.  Consistent use as directed by a doctor is crucial.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  While generally well-tolerated, potential interactions are rare.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any significant side effects, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.
* **Can I use Natamycin for other fungal infections?**  No, Natamycin is specifically for certain types of fungal infections.  Do not use it to treat other fungal infections without consulting a doctor.  Using it for non-indicated purposes may be ineffective and potentially harmful.
