# Natamycin
### Generic Name
Natamycin

### Usage
Natamycin is a topical antifungal medication primarily used to treat fungal infections of the eye.  Its main applications include:

* **Fungal keratitis:** This is a serious infection of the cornea (the clear front part of the eye). Natamycin helps fight the fungus causing this infection, preventing vision-threatening complications.
* **Fungal conjunctivitis:**  This is an inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye). Natamycin effectively treats fungal infections causing this condition.
* **Fungal blepharitis:** This is an inflammation of the eyelids often caused by a fungal infection. Natamycin can help control the infection and alleviate symptoms.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Fungal keratitis (Ophthalmic Suspension 5%):** Initially, instill one drop into the conjunctival sac (the space between the eyelid and the eyeball) every one to two hours. After three to four days, reduce the frequency to one drop six to eight times daily. Treatment typically lasts two to three weeks, or until the infection is resolved.  The dosage should be gradually reduced at four to seven-day intervals to prevent recurrence.

* **Fungal blepharitis and conjunctivitis (Ophthalmic Suspension 5%):** Instill one drop into the conjunctival sac four to six times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of natamycin in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically directed by a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

No dosage adjustments are usually needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment due to the low systemic absorption of topical natamycin. However, always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Eye irritation
* Burning sensation
* Stinging
* Redness
* Discomfort
* Mild pain
* Itching
* Increased tearing

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include allergic reactions (such as rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), corneal opacity (clouding of the cornea), and changes in vision.  If any serious side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Natamycin is a polyene antifungal antibiotic. It works by binding to sterols in the fungal cell membrane. This binding alters the membrane's permeability, causing leakage of essential cellular components and ultimately leading to fungal cell death.  It effectively targets the fungus without significantly harming human cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Natamycin should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to natamycin or any of its components.
* **Interactions:**  While generally safe, there's a possibility of interactions with other eye medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently using.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Natamycin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  This means that the potential risks to a developing fetus are not fully known. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. The excretion of natamycin in breast milk is unknown; hence caution is advised when using it during breastfeeding.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying natamycin and avoid wearing them during treatment, as the formulation might contain preservatives that can be absorbed by soft contact lenses.
* **Epithelial Ulcers:** Use caution in patients with epithelial ulcers, as the suspension might adhere to these ulcers.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for natamycin to work?**  A: Improvement may be seen within a few days, but complete resolution of the infection often takes several weeks.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store natamycin?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q:  What if my infection doesn't improve after using natamycin for a week or more?** A:  This may indicate the infection is caused by a different microorganism not susceptible to natamycin. Consult your doctor immediately for alternative treatment options.
