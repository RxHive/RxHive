# Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate
### Generic Name
Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate

This combination is typically found in over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications.  It's important to note that the exact formulation (the amounts of each ingredient) can vary between brands.  Always check the label of the specific product you are using.

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, influenza (the flu), and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Each ingredient targets specific symptoms:

* **Noscapine:** An opioid derivative, noscapine acts as a cough suppressant (an antitussive). It reduces the urge to cough by affecting the cough center in the brain.  It does not typically cause the drowsiness associated with other opioid cough suppressants.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, chlorpheniramine helps to relieve runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies and the common cold. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Ammonium Chloride & Sodium Citrate:** These ingredients act as expectorants. They help to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear from the lungs. This can be particularly helpful in relieving a productive cough (one that produces mucus).

This combination medicine is designed to address multiple symptoms simultaneously; therefore, it's not intended for treating the underlying cause of the infection but rather managing its associated symptoms.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific product and the age and weight of the patient.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.**  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.  This information should not be considered a substitute for consulting a doctor or pharmacist.  There is generally no IV formulation of this combination drug; it is usually administered orally.

* **Adults:** The typical dosage will be specified on the product label, but generally involves taking a specific number of tablets or teaspoons of liquid at set intervals (e.g., every 4-6 hours).

* **Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower and depends on the child's age and weight.  Never give a child a medication intended for adults. Always consult a pediatrician or pharmacist before giving any over-the-counter medicine to a child.  Specific pediatric formulations often exist with appropriate dosing instructions.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Constipation
* Difficulty urinating

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures

**If you experience any serious side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works

As explained in the "Usage" section, each component of this combination medication works through a different mechanism: Noscapine suppresses the cough reflex, chlorpheniramine blocks histamine, and ammonium chloride and sodium citrate thin mucus.  They work synergistically to alleviate various cold and flu symptoms.
