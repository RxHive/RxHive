# Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate

**Usage:** This combination is typically used as an over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medication.  It's designed to treat the symptoms of the common cold and the flu, including:

* **Cough:** Noscapine acts as a cough suppressant (antitussive), reducing the urge to cough.
* **Runny Nose/Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine, which helps to dry up runny noses and reduce sneezing.
* **Chest Congestion:** Ammonium chloride and sodium citrate are expectorants.  They help to thin the mucus in the lungs and make it easier to cough up, relieving chest congestion.

**Important Note:** This combination is primarily for symptomatic relief and does *not* cure the underlying illness.  It's crucial to consult a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:**  This is a common side effect of both noscapine and chlorpheniramine. Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry Mouth:**  A common antihistamine side effect.
* **Constipation:**  Possible with some formulations.
* **Nausea/Vomiting:** Less common but possible.
* **Dizziness:** Particularly with higher doses.
* **Headache:**  Less common but possible.
* **Blurred Vision:** Less common but possible.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Though rare, allergic reactions, including rash, itching, or swelling, are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.


**How it Works:**

* **Noscapine:** This opioid derivative acts centrally in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't affect pain perception like other opioids.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This antihistamine works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This reduces symptoms like sneezing and runny nose.
* **Ammonium Chloride & Sodium Citrate:** These act as expectorants by increasing the fluid content of respiratory tract secretions, making mucus thinner and easier to expel.
