# Naftopidil
### Generic Name
Naftopidil

### Usage
Naftopidil is primarily used to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as an enlarged prostate.  BPH causes urinary problems such as frequent urination, difficulty starting urination, weak urine stream, and nighttime urination.  Naftopidil helps relieve these symptoms by relaxing the muscles in the prostate and urethra, improving urine flow.  It's important to note that Naftopidil does not treat the underlying cause of BPH, but rather manages its symptoms.


### Dosage
The recommended dosage of Naftopidil for adults with BPH is typically started at 25 mg once daily (OD).  The dose may be increased by the physician in increments, up to a maximum of 75 mg per day, at intervals of one to two weeks depending on individual response and tolerability.  This medication is usually taken orally as a tablet.   The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment, so caution is advised in patients with these conditions.  Naftopidil is not indicated for use in women.  Dosage for children is not established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Clouding of consciousness
* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST)

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:

* Loss of consciousness
* Chest pain
* Syncope (fainting)
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hepatic disease/insufficiency/jaundice
* Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (during eye surgery)
* Visual disturbances

Many other side effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports, emphasizing the importance of reporting any unusual symptoms to a healthcare professional.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Naftopidil is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, specifically targeting alpha-1A and alpha-1D receptors in the prostate.  It has a higher affinity for the alpha-1D subtype. By blocking these receptors, Naftopidil relaxes the smooth muscles in the prostate and urethra. This relaxation reduces the constriction of the urethra, allowing for improved urine flow and alleviating the symptoms of BPH.


### Precautions
Naftopidil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.  It should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, hepatic impairment, and elderly patients.  There is an increased risk of hypotension (low blood pressure), orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), syncope, and ocular effects, particularly intraoperative floppy iris syndrome in patients undergoing cataract surgery.  The concomitant use of Naftopidil with other alpha-1 blockers should be avoided.  It may interact with other medications, affecting their levels or effects; consult a healthcare provider to discuss potential drug interactions.  Naftopidil is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
