# Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Methylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Methylcellulose (This is a combination drug; there's no single generic name encompassing all three.)

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical nasal decongestant and antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of nasal congestion and allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  Specifically:

* **Naphazoline:**  A sympathomimetic decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and relieving congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions, reducing symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose.
* **Methylcellulose:** A lubricating agent that helps to soothe irritated nasal passages and improve the delivery of the other active ingredients.

This combination is typically used for short-term relief of symptoms, such as those associated with the common cold, allergies, or sinusitis.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage, but common ones include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation in the nose**
* **Dryness in the nose and throat**
* **Headache**
* **Drowsiness** (more likely with chlorpheniramine)
* **Nausea**
* **Increased heart rate** (less common, more likely with naphazoline)
* **Rebound congestion** (if used for prolonged periods, the congestion can worsen after the effect wears off)
* **High blood pressure** (rare, more likely with naphazoline)
* **Allergic reactions** (rash, itching, swelling)


**How it Works:**

* **Naphazoline:** Works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages. This causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), reducing swelling and nasal congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic responses like sneezing, itching, runny nose, and watery eyes.
* **Methylcellulose:** Acts as a lubricant and vehicle, improving the spread and adherence of the other active ingredients within the nasal passages, helping to soothe irritation.
