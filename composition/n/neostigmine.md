# Neostigmine
### Generic Name
Neostigmine

### Usage

Neostigmine is a medication primarily used to treat myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder causing muscle weakness.  It's also used to reverse the effects of certain muscle relaxants (non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers) given during surgery, helping patients regain normal muscle function after the procedure.  Additionally, it can be used to treat postoperative urinary retention (difficulty urinating after surgery) and, off-label,  acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome), a condition causing severe abdominal distension.  The use in Ogilvie syndrome is not officially supported by the FDA but is sometimes used by clinicians.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (oral, intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), or subcutaneous (SubQ)), and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.  The following information is for general understanding and should not be considered medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Myasthenia Gravis (Diagnosis):** A single IM injection of 0.022 mg/kg.  If inconclusive, a second dose of 0.031 mg/kg may be administered on a different day.  Atropine pretreatment is usually recommended.
* **Myasthenia Gravis (Treatment):** Oral:  Initial dose is typically 15 mg three times daily (TID),  with the total daily dose often reaching 150 mg in divided doses.  The dose is adjusted based on individual response. IM, IV, or SubQ: 0.5-2.5 mg, based on response.
* **Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade:** IV: 0.03-0.07 mg/kg.  The precise dose depends on the type and duration of the neuromuscular blocker used and the patient's response.  Atropine or a similar anticholinergic medication is usually given beforehand to prevent unwanted side effects.  Peripheral nerve stimulation (train-of-four) is used to monitor the effectiveness of the reversal.
* **Postoperative Urinary Retention (Prevention):** IM or SubQ: 0.25 mg soon after surgery, repeated every 4-6 hours for 2-3 days.
* **Postoperative Urinary Retention (Treatment):** IM or SubQ: 0.5-1 mg. If urination doesn't occur within an hour, catheterization is necessary.  Repeated doses may be given every 3 hours (up to five doses) after bladder emptying.
* **Acute Colonic Pseudo-obstruction (Off-label):** IV: 2 mg over 3-5 minutes.  Slower administration (over 60 minutes) may reduce bradycardia but may also reduce effectiveness.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and calculated based on weight.  Consult a pediatrician or specialist for precise instructions.  Similar principles apply to the different uses as in adults, with adjustments based on age and weight.  Atropine premedication is often advised.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Increased salivation
* Abdominal cramps
* Muscle weakness or twitching
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Sweating

Less common but more serious side effects may involve:

* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)


If any adverse effects occur, immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Neostigmine works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter essential for muscle contraction. By preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, neostigmine increases its levels at neuromuscular junctions, leading to improved muscle strength in myasthenia gravis and reversal of neuromuscular blockade.  The increased acetylcholine also affects other systems in the body, contributing to the effects seen in urinary retention and potentially in Ogilvie syndrome.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Neostigmine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, mechanical obstruction of the bowel or urinary tract, and certain types of hypersensitivity (for example to bromides in tablet forms).
* **Interactions:** Neostigmine can interact with many other medications, including anticholinergic drugs, neuromuscular blocking agents, and others. Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with asthma, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, epilepsy, vagotonia, or renal impairment.  Close monitoring is recommended in patients with renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Neostigmine is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its safety during pregnancy is not fully established.  It should be used only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Excretion into breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Neostigmine?** A:  Store according to the label instructions, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Neostigmine suddenly?** A: No, always follow your doctor's instructions for stopping the medication.  Sudden cessation can lead to a worsening of symptoms.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is Neostigmine addictive?** A:  Neostigmine is not considered an addictive medication.
* **Q: What are the signs of a cholinergic crisis?** A:  Symptoms can include excessive sweating, salivation, muscle weakness, respiratory difficulty, and gastrointestinal distress.  Seek immediate medical attention.
