# Nilotinib
### Generic Name
Nilotinib

### Usage
Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that is Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+).  This means it's effective against CML driven by the abnormal BCR-ABL gene.  It's approved for use in adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in the chronic phase. It's also used for adults whose CML in the chronic or accelerated phase is resistant to or intolerant of prior treatment with imatinib (another tyrosine kinase inhibitor).  While not officially labeled for these uses, nilotinib is sometimes used off-label in combination with chemotherapy for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and for refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).  The specific use and dosage will always be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual patient's condition and response to treatment.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Newly diagnosed Ph+ CML (chronic phase):**  The usual oral dose is 300 mg twice daily (BID), approximately 12 hours apart, taken on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after eating).  In some cases, discontinuation of treatment may be considered after at least 3 years of sustained molecular response.

* **Ph+ CML (chronic or accelerated phase; resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib therapy):** The usual oral dose is 400 mg BID, approximately 12 hours apart, taken on an empty stomach.  Similar to newly diagnosed cases, discontinuation may be considered after sustained response, but criteria are stricter.

* **Ph+ ALL (off-label):** Dosing varies considerably depending on the treatment phase (induction, consolidation, maintenance), usually 400 mg BID, often in combination with other chemotherapy agents.

* **Refractory GIST (off-label):** The typical dose is 400 mg BID until disease progression or intolerable side effects.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

For children with Ph+ CML in the chronic phase (newly diagnosed, resistant, or intolerant to prior therapy), the oral dose is typically calculated as 230 mg/mÂ² BID (approximately 12 hours apart, on an empty stomach). The maximum single dose is 400 mg.  The calculated dose should be rounded to the nearest 50 mg. Treatment continues as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity develops.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on factors such as liver function (hepatic impairment), kidney function (renal impairment), and the severity of side effects.  These adjustments should always be made under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* QT interval prolongation (on ECG)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Pancreatitis
* Severe allergic reactions
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Fluid retention (pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites, pulmonary edema)
* Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke)
* Tumor lysis syndrome

If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above,  contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by selectively blocking the activity of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enzyme. This enzyme is abnormally active in Ph+ CML and plays a critical role in the uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells. By inhibiting BCR-ABL, nilotinib prevents the leukemia cells from proliferating and helps to control the disease.  It also shows activity against other kinases, like c-KIT and PDGFR, potentially contributing to its broader effects in some cases.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nilotinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, persistent QTc prolongation (>480 msec), hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and long QT syndrome.

* **Drug Interactions:** Nilotinib can interact with several other medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Particular caution should be exercised with drugs that affect gastric acid secretion (PPIs), strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and other drugs that prolong the QT interval.

* **Warnings:**  Nilotinib carries a boxed warning regarding QT prolongation and the risk of sudden death. Regular monitoring of the QT interval on ECG, electrolyte levels, and careful management of risk factors are necessary.  Furthermore, it can cause bone marrow suppression, cardiovascular events, hemorrhage, hepatotoxicity, and fluid retention.  Use should be approached cautiously in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors or a history of pancreatitis.  Nilotinib is also a Category D drug in pregnancy; effective contraception is essential, and breastfeeding is not recommended during or shortly after treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I eat while taking Nilotinib?** A: No, it should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after a meal).

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Simply resume your regular dosing schedule.

* **Q: How should I store Nilotinib?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Are there specific monitoring requirements while on Nilotinib?** A: Yes, regular blood tests (complete blood count, liver function tests, electrolytes), and ECG monitoring are typically needed to monitor for side effects and treatment effectiveness.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while on Nilotinib?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor as it might interact with the medication or worsen side effects.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Nilotinib?** A: The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on your specific condition, response to therapy, and individual circumstances.  Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate treatment length.
