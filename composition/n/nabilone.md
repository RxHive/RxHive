# Nabilone
### Generic Name
Nabilone

### Usage
Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid primarily used to treat severe nausea and vomiting that doesn't respond to standard antiemetic treatments.  This type of nausea and vomiting is often associated with cancer chemotherapy.  It's specifically indicated for patients who haven't found relief with other antiemetic medications.  It is important to note that current clinical practice guidelines do not recommend Nabilone for preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children due to a lack of proven efficacy and safety.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (for refractory nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy):**

* **Oral:** The starting dose is typically 1-2 mg twice daily (BID).  The dose can be increased if needed, but the maximum daily dose is 6 mg, divided into three doses (TID).  Nabilone may be given BID or TID throughout the entire chemotherapy course and continued for up to 48 hours after the last chemotherapy dose. A single dose of 1-2 mg the night before chemotherapy might also be beneficial.  Recent guidance suggests that Nabilone might be considered for refractory or breakthrough nausea and vomiting (occurring despite optimal prophylaxis) in patients who have already received a trial of olanzapine.

**Pediatric Dosage (for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting):**

* **Oral (Note:  Use in children is not generally recommended due to safety and efficacy concerns):** Dosage is weight-based and is generally not used in current clinical practice.  Previously suggested dosing was:
    * Weight <18 kg: 0.5 mg BID
    * Weight 18-30 kg: 1 mg BID
    * Weight >30 kg: 1 mg TID


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on manufacturer labeling.

### How it Works

Nabilone's antiemetic effect is believed to be due to its interaction with cannabinoid receptors (CB1 receptors) in the central nervous system (CNS).  By interacting with these receptors, it helps to reduce the signals that trigger nausea and vomiting.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nabilone is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to nabilone, other cannabinoids, or any components of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nabilone can interact with numerous other medications, including alcohol, CNS depressants, and various other drugs. It can either enhance or decrease their effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking before starting nabilone.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, mental health conditions (mania, depression, schizophrenia), and a history of substance abuse.  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects.  Avoid activities requiring mental alertness (driving, operating machinery) due to the risk of drowsiness and impaired coordination.  Nabilone is a controlled substance with a high potential for abuse and should be used with careful monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nabilone is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its potential risks are not fully understood.  It's not recommended during breastfeeding as it may be excreted in breast milk.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Nabilone to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but effects are generally seen within a few hours of administration.

* **Q: How should I store Nabilone?** A: Store Nabilone as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Nabilone suddenly?** A:  It's generally best to taper off Nabilone under the guidance of a doctor to minimize potential withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Is Nabilone addictive?** A:  Yes, Nabilone is a controlled substance and carries a risk of addiction, especially with misuse or prolonged use.  Strict adherence to prescribed dosages and monitoring are vital.
