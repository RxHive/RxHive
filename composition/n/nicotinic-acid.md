# Nicotinic acid
### Generic Name
Nicotinic Acid

### Usage
Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin, is primarily used to treat and prevent pellagra, a disease caused by a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3).  Pellagra is characterized by skin rashes, diarrhea, dementia, and ultimately death if left untreated. Nicotinic acid is crucial for various metabolic processes in the body, including the production of energy and the synthesis of DNA and RNA.

Beyond treating pellagra, nicotinic acid has significant applications in managing dyslipidemia, a condition involving abnormally high levels of fats (lipids) in the blood.  Specifically, it's used to lower levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol, triglycerides, and to slightly raise levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol.  This effect makes it a valuable tool in cardiovascular disease prevention, often used in conjunction with other lipid-lowering medications or lifestyle changes.  It's important to note that while nicotinic acid can be beneficial for cardiovascular health, it's not a first-line treatment and is typically considered after other options have been explored.


### Dosage
Dosage of nicotinic acid varies greatly depending on the reason for its use.  It's crucial to follow the prescription and instructions provided by your healthcare provider.

**For Pellagra:**  The dosage is determined by the severity of the deficiency and is usually administered orally.  Specific amounts will be determined by a physician based on individual need.

**For Dyslipidemia:**  Dosage for this condition typically starts low and is gradually increased to find the most effective dose with tolerable side effects.  Oral dosages range from a few hundred milligrams per day to several grams per day, often divided into multiple doses.  Higher doses are usually required to achieve significant lipid-lowering effects.  Sustained-release formulations can help minimize flushing.  Intravenous administration is not typically used for dyslipidemia.

**Children:** The use of nicotinic acid in children is generally only considered in cases of severe niacin deficiency under strict medical supervision.  Dosage will be carefully determined based on the child's age, weight, and specific condition.

**Forms:** Nicotinic acid is available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and extended-release formulations.  The extended-release formulations are designed to reduce the frequency of side effects.

**Administration:** Nicotinic acid is typically taken orally with food to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of nicotinic acid, particularly at higher doses, include:

* Flushing (redness and warmth of the skin)
* Itching
* Headache
* Nausea
* Gastrointestinal upset (indigestion, heartburn)
* Liver damage (rare but serious)
* Increased blood sugar levels
* Gout (in predisposed individuals)


Less common but serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:

* Severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Severe allergic reactions


If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Nicotinic acid acts as a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are essential coenzymes involved in numerous metabolic processes.  In the case of pellagra, it directly addresses the vitamin B3 deficiency.  Regarding its lipid-lowering effects, the precise mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve several pathways:  It may reduce the production of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the liver, increase the activity of lipoprotein lipase (which breaks down triglycerides), and influence the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.


### Precautions
* **Liver Disease:** Nicotinic acid should be used with extreme caution in individuals with pre-existing liver disease, as it can further impair liver function.  Regular liver function tests are often recommended.
* **Diabetes:** Nicotinic acid can elevate blood sugar levels, so careful monitoring is necessary for individuals with diabetes.
* **Gout:** Nicotinic acid may increase uric acid levels, potentially exacerbating gout in susceptible individuals.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nicotinic acid may interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners) and some cholesterol-lowering drugs.  It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of nicotinic acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered under strict medical supervision, as its safety in these situations is not fully established.
* **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of liver damage when taking nicotinic acid.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to see results when using nicotinic acid for dyslipidemia?**  A:  The effects on cholesterol and triglycerides may not be noticeable immediately.  It usually takes several weeks to months of consistent use to see significant changes.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nicotinic acid without consulting my doctor?** A: No.  Suddenly stopping nicotinic acid, especially if it's being used to treat a chronic condition, can be harmful.  Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: How should I store nicotinic acid?** A:  Store nicotinic acid in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as instructed on the product label.

* **Q: Is nicotinic acid the same as niacinamide?** A: While both are forms of vitamin B3, they have different effects and uses. Nicotinic acid causes more flushing, while niacinamide does not.  Niacinamide is generally preferred for those with sensitive skin or a history of adverse reactions to nicotinic acid.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe flushing?** A:  If you experience severe flushing, stop taking the medication and contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Lowering the dose or switching to a sustained-release formulation may help reduce this side effect.
