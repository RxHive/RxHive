# Nicotinic acid

**Generic Name:** Nicotinic Acid (also known as Niacin)

**Usage:**

* **Hyperlipidemia (High Cholesterol):** Nicotinic acid is used to lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, triglycerides, and sometimes to raise HDL ("good") cholesterol.  It's often used in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications.
* **Pellagra:** This is a severe deficiency disease caused by a lack of niacin in the diet. Nicotinic acid supplementation is used to treat and prevent pellagra.

**Side Effects:**

Nicotinic acid can cause a range of side effects, some of which are dose-related.  These include:

* **Flushing:** This is the most common side effect, characterized by a feeling of warmth, redness, and itching of the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and chest. It usually occurs within 20-30 minutes of taking the medication and can be intense.  Lower doses, extended-release formulations, and aspirin pretreatment can help mitigate flushing.
* **Gastrointestinal Upset:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are possible.
* **Liver Damage:**  Rare but serious; liver function tests should be monitored, especially with high doses.
* **Elevated Blood Sugar:** Can worsen diabetes or cause hyperglycemia.
* **Blurred Vision:** Less common side effect.
* **Itching:**  Can be associated with flushing or occur independently.
* **Headache:** Relatively common.
* **Dizziness:**  Less frequent.


**How it Works:**

Nicotinic acid works through several mechanisms to lower cholesterol and triglycerides:

* **Reduces the production of VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein):** VLDL is a precursor to LDL cholesterol. By reducing VLDL production, nicotinic acid indirectly lowers LDL levels.
* **Increases HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol:**  Nicotinic acid can significantly raise HDL levels, offering cardiovascular protection.
* **Reduces the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue:** This decreases the amount of fatty acids available to the liver for triglyceride synthesis.

**FAQs:**

* **Is nicotinic acid the same as niacinamide?** No, although both are forms of vitamin B3, they have different effects. Nicotinic acid is more effective at lowering lipids but causes flushing, while niacinamide is less effective at lowering lipids but does not cause flushing.
* **How should I take nicotinic acid?** Always follow your doctor's instructions.  Dosage and timing depend on the specific condition being treated.
* **Can I take nicotinic acid with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking, as interactions are possible, particularly with diabetes medications, blood thinners, and other lipid-lowering drugs.
* **What are the long-term effects of taking nicotinic acid?** Long-term use may require regular monitoring of liver function and blood sugar levels.  Some individuals may develop tolerance to the flushing effect over time.
* **What if I experience flushing?** Talk to your doctor. They might suggest a lower dose, an extended-release formulation, aspirin pre-treatment, or a different medication.
