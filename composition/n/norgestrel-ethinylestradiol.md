# Norgestrel + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Norgestrel + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage
Norgestrel and Ethinylestradiol is a combination birth control pill used in females of reproductive age to prevent pregnancy.  This combined oral contraceptive pill works through multiple mechanisms: suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg), thickening cervical mucus to hinder sperm from reaching the egg, and altering the uterine lining to make implantation of a fertilized egg less likely.  It's primarily used for contraception, and has no other notable secondary uses.

### Dosage
**Contraception (Females):**  The typical adult dose is one tablet orally once daily (containing 0.03 mg Ethinylestradiol and 0.3 mg Norgestrel).  There are two main starting schedules:

* **Sunday Start:** Begin taking the first pill on the first Sunday following the onset of menstruation. If menstruation begins on a Sunday, start that day.  Additional contraception is needed for the first seven days of use with this method.
* **Day 1 Start:** Start taking the first pill on the first day of the menstrual cycle.

**Pediatric Dosage:** This medication is not recommended for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment. No specific dosage adjustments are provided for renal impairment; however, caution is advised, and blood pressure should be closely monitored in these patients.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

*   Headache
*   Nausea
*   Breast tenderness
*   Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
*   Weight changes
*   Mood changes
*   Acne


Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

*   Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, heart attack)
*   High blood pressure
*   Liver problems (including liver tumors)
*   Gallbladder disease
*   Depression


Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  Contact your doctor or other healthcare professional if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Norgestrel and Ethinylestradiol is a combined oral contraceptive containing a progestin (norgestrel) and an estrogen (ethinylestradiol).  These hormones work together to prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation.  The progestin also thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and alters the uterine lining to make implantation less likely.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with:

*   Hypersensitivity to norgestrel, ethinylestradiol, or any component of the formulation.
*   Active or history of breast cancer, or estrogen- or progestin-sensitive cancers.
*   Active or history of arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke, myocardial infarction), thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), or thrombogenic valvular disease.
*   Uncontrolled hypertension.
*   Diabetes mellitus with vascular involvement.
*   Migraine headaches with aura.
*   Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding.
*   Benign or malignant liver tumors, hepatic impairment, or cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy.
*   History of jaundice following oral contraceptive use.
*   Pregnancy.
*   Concurrent use of specific hepatitis C drug combinations (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir).
* Women over 35 who smoke, or any women with migraine headaches.
* Inherited or acquired coagulopathies.
* Thrombogenic valvular or rhythm diseases of the heart.

**Warnings:** Increased risk of certain conditions exists, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer, and thromboembolic disorders.  Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events with combined oral contraceptive use, especially in women over 35.  Use caution in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, history of depression, diabetes or prediabetes, and conditions exacerbated by fluid retention.  This medication should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks following elective surgery associated with increased thromboembolic risk or during prolonged immobilization.  It does not protect against HIV infection or sexually transmitted diseases.


**Drug Interactions:**  Many interactions are possible; consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** This medication is contraindicated during pregnancy (Category X).  It is excreted in breast milk and may reduce milk production; alternative contraception is recommended during breastfeeding.
