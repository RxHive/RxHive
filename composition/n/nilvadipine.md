# Nilvadipine
### Generic Name
Nilvadipine

### Usage
Nilvadipine is a calcium channel blocker primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (chest pain).  Angina treated with Nilvadipine is specifically vasospastic angina (chest pain caused by spasms in the coronary arteries) or chronic stable angina (chest pain that occurs predictably during exertion).  While not its primary use, it may also be used in the management of certain cerebrovascular diseases.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** The usual oral dose is 4-16 mg daily.  This may need to be reduced to a maximum of 8 mg daily in patients with liver cirrhosis or those concurrently taking cimetidine (a medication used to treat ulcers).

* **Angina Pectoris (vasospastic or chronic stable):** The typical oral dose is 8-16 mg daily.

* **Cerebrovascular Disease:** The usual oral dose is 2-4 mg twice daily.

**Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Nilvadipine have not been established in children.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  The daily dose should not exceed 8 mg in patients with liver cirrhosis.

* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment; however, use should be cautious. Nilvadipine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.


**Administration:** Nilvadipine is administered orally (by mouth).  Follow your doctor's instructions precisely regarding the dose and timing of your medication.


### Side Effects

* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Flushing (reddening of the skin)
* Paradoxical increase in ischemic chest pain (worsening chest pain)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Nilvadipine works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into the heart muscle cells and blood vessel walls.  Calcium ions play a crucial role in muscle contraction. By reducing calcium influx, Nilvadipine relaxes the blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure and decreased resistance to blood flow in the coronary arteries (reducing chest pain).  This improved blood flow increases oxygen delivery to the heart muscle.


### Precautions

**Contraindications (Nilvadipine should NOT be used in these cases):**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Nilvadipine or other calcium channel blockers
* Cardiogenic shock (a life-threatening condition where the heart isn't pumping enough blood)
* Recent myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Unstable angina (chest pain that occurs frequently and unpredictably)
* Severe renal impairment (severe kidney disease)
* Congestive heart failure
* Aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve)


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Increased risk:**  Nilvadipine may increase the risk of exacerbation of angina, hypotension (low blood pressure), hepatic (liver) effects, peripheral edema, and dermatologic (skin) reactions.
* **Use with caution:**  Use with caution in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (mild to moderate kidney disease), when used concomitantly with beta-blockers (especially in patients with left ventricular dysfunction), and in patients with gastrointestinal hypermotility or obstruction (for extended-release formulations, if applicable).
* **Grapefruit Juice:** Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice while taking Nilvadipine, as it can increase the drug's blood levels.
* **Driving and hazardous activities:** Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Nilvadipine affects you.
* **Abrupt Withdrawal:** Avoid abrupt cessation of Nilvadipine; gradual withdrawal is recommended to minimize the potential for increased adverse effects.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nilvadipine may interact with other medications, including beta-blockers, cimetidine, ranitidine, and antipsychotics.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Nilvadipine with other medications?**

A:  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting Nilvadipine.  Some medications can interact with it, potentially altering its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.

**Q: How should I store Nilvadipine?**

A: Store Nilvadipine as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: How long will it take before I feel the effects of Nilvadipine?**

A: The time it takes to feel the effects of Nilvadipine varies depending on several factors, including your individual response and the severity of your condition.  It might take a few days or weeks for you to notice a significant improvement.  Maintain regular contact with your physician to assess the efficacy of the treatment.

**Q:  Can I stop taking Nilvadipine suddenly?**

A: No. Stopping Nilvadipine suddenly can lead to an increase in adverse effects. Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your dose.  A gradual tapering off is typically recommended.
