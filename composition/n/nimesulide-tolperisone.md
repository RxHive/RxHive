**How it Works:**

* **Nimesulide:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing inflammation and pain.  It inhibits the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain sensation.

* **Tolperisone:** This is a muscle relaxant that reduces muscle spasms and stiffness.  Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to act on the central nervous system to decrease muscle activity.

The combination of these two drugs provides both pain relief and muscle relaxation, making it effective in treating conditions involving both pain and muscle spasms.
