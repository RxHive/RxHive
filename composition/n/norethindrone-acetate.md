# Norethindrone Acetate
### Generic Name
Norethindrone Acetate

### Usage
Norethindrone acetate is primarily used to treat abnormal uterine bleeding (due to hormonal imbalance, not organic pathology) and endometriosis.  It's a progestin, a type of hormone, that works by altering the uterine lining and impacting hormone levels in the body.  In the case of abnormal uterine bleeding, it helps regulate the menstrual cycle.  For endometriosis, it helps to shrink endometrial tissue outside the uterus, reducing pain and other symptoms.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  Always follow the prescription provided by your doctor.  There is no established pediatric dosage.  

**Secondary Amenorrhea/Abnormal Uterine Bleeding:** The usual oral dose is 2.5-10mg, starting on day 5 of the menstrual cycle and continuing until day 25.

**Endometriosis:**  Treatment typically starts with 5mg daily for two weeks, gradually increasing by 2.5mg every two weeks until a maximum of 15mg daily is reached. This higher dose is generally maintained for 6-9 months, or until breakthrough bleeding necessitates temporary discontinuation.  The doctor will monitor progress and adjust the dosage accordingly.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment.  For hepatic impairment, norethindrone acetate is contraindicated in cases of severe insufficiency; safety and efficacy haven't been established for milder forms.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Edema (swelling)
*   Weakness
*   Loss of appetite (anorexia)
*   Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
*   Breakthrough bleeding
*   Changes in menstrual flow
*   Spotting
*   Deep vein thrombosis
*   Thrombophlebitis (blood clot inflammation)
*   Depression
*   Dizziness
*   Headache
*   Nervousness
*   Sleepiness (somnolence)
*   Breast tenderness
*   Galactorrhea (inappropriate milk production)
*   Abdominal pain
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Weight changes
*   Cholestatic jaundice (liver disorder)

Less common, but serious side effects, include blood clots and liver problems.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any sudden vision changes, severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or unexplained leg pain.


### How it Works
Norethindrone acetate is a synthetic progestin.  In the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, it causes changes in the uterine lining, reducing bleeding. In endometriosis, it works by suppressing the production of gonadotropins (hormones that stimulate the ovaries). This reduced hormone production leads to endometrial atrophy (shrinking of the endometrial tissue) and decreased estrogen levels, ultimately reducing the size and activity of endometrial implants outside the uterus.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Norethindrone acetate is contraindicated in individuals with:

*   Hypersensitivity (allergy) to norethindrone acetate
*   History of venous thromboembolism (blood clots in veins)
*   History of arterial thromboembolism (blood clots in arteries)
*   Liver disease
*   History of estrogen or progestin-dependent malignancies (cancers)
*   Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
*   Partial or complete vision loss due to ophthalmic vascular disease
*   Known or suspected pregnancy
*   Missed abortion

**Warnings:**  The medication should be discontinued if sudden partial or complete vision loss, proptosis (protruding eyes), diplopia (double vision), or migraine occurs. Use with caution in patients with cardiac or renal disease (due to potential fluid retention), depression, dyslipidemias (abnormal blood fats), or diabetes.

**Drug Interactions:**  Norethindrone acetate's concentration might be reduced by CYP450 inducers.  It can cause additive fluid retention with NSAIDs and vasodilators, and might increase ciclosporin concentration. Concomitant use with these medications should be carefully considered and monitored by a healthcare professional.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Norethindrone acetate is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to a developing fetus and should not be used during pregnancy.  It also enters breast milk, making it unsuitable for breastfeeding mothers.
