# Nusinersen
### Generic Name
Nusinersen

### Usage
Nusinersen is primarily used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and wasting.  It's approved for use in infants, children, and adults with SMA.  While its primary application is in treating SMA, there are currently no notable secondary uses approved.

### Dosage
Nusinersen is administered intrathecally (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord).  The dosage is the same for both adults and children:

* **Loading Dose:** 12 mg is given once every 14 days for a total of three doses.
* **Fourth Dose:** A fourth dose of 12 mg is administered 30 days after the third dose.
* **Maintenance Dose:** 12 mg is given once every 4 months after the loading doses.

The medication is supplied as a sterile solution for intrathecal injection and should be administered by a healthcare professional experienced in performing this type of injection.  The physician should carefully follow the provided instructions for preparation and administration to minimize the risk of complications.

### Side Effects
The following side effects have been reported with Nusinersen use:

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Constipation
* Vomiting
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Proteinuria (protein in the urine)
* Back pain
* Lower respiratory tract infection
* Atelectasis (collapsed lung)
* Fever

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Falls
* Flatulence
* Weight loss
* Urinary tract infection
* Seasonal allergy
* Antibody development
* Respiratory congestion
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Otic infection (ear infection)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Aseptic meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord)
* Hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Maculopapular rash
* Meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord)
* Serious infections
* Skin rash

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide.  This means it's a small piece of genetic material designed to bind to a specific target within a cell. In the case of Nusinersen, the target is a specific sequence of RNA within the *SMN2* gene.  Mutations in the *SMN1* gene cause SMA by resulting in a deficiency of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein.  The *SMN2* gene produces some functional SMN protein, but it is often insufficient.  Nusinersen works by altering the splicing of the *SMN2* pre-mRNA, thereby increasing the production of full-length, functional SMN protein.  This increase in SMN protein helps to improve motor neuron function and reduce the severity of SMA.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Nusinersen is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to Nusinersen or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of coagulation abnormalities and thrombocytopenia (including acute severe thrombocytopenia) and renal toxicity (including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Nusinersen during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood counts (platelets), urine protein levels, and coagulation tests is necessary.  Careful attention should be paid to signs of bleeding and kidney problems.

### FAQs
