# Nesiritide
### Generic Name
Nesiritide

### Usage
Nesiritide is a medication used to treat acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in adults.  This means it's used for people experiencing a sudden worsening of their heart failure symptoms, specifically when they have shortness of breath at rest or with minimal physical activity.  It's administered intravenously (IV) to provide rapid relief of these symptoms.  It is *not* a long-term treatment for heart failure.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  The typical dose is an initial intravenous bolus of 2 mcg/kg (optional, may be omitted in certain patients, see below), followed by a continuous infusion at 0.01 mcg/kg/min.  The initial bolus dose is generally not recommended for patients with a low systolic blood pressure (less than 110 mmHg) or those recently treated with medications that lower afterload (resistance to blood flow in the arteries).  Increasing the infusion rate beyond the initial dose should only be done under close medical supervision with careful monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function. If hypotension occurs, the infusion should be stopped until the blood pressure stabilizes, then restarted at a reduced dose (approximately 70% of the previous infusion rate, omitting the bolus).

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of nesiritide in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. While no dosage adjustment is needed for patients with renal (kidney) impairment, close monitoring of kidney function is crucial, as nesiritide can affect kidney function.  Caution should be exercised in patients whose kidney function relies heavily on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

### Side Effects

* **Common (greater than 10%):** Hypotension (low blood pressure), increased serum creatinine levels (indicating potential kidney problems)
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Headache, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), nausea, back pain
* **Rare (less than 1%):** Extravasation (leakage of medication from the IV site), hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), pruritus (itching), skin rash.

**Important:** Any significant or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Nesiritide is a synthetic form of a naturally occurring hormone, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). It works by binding to receptors in blood vessels, causing them to relax and widen. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure and reduces the workload on the heart, easing the symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure, especially shortness of breath.  It also increases urine output, helping to remove excess fluid from the body.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Nesiritide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to natriuretic peptides, cardiogenic shock (when used as primary therapy), and persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg) before starting treatment.

**Interactions:** Nesiritide's hypotensive effects may be enhanced when used with certain medications, including those that lower blood pressure (e.g., alfuzosin, second-generation antipsychotics, barbiturates, molsidomine, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors).  Use caution and close monitoring is needed when combining these medications.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reactions, hypotension, and renal effects (such as the development of azotemia, a build-up of nitrogenous waste in the blood).  Use caution in patients with renal impairment or those receiving prolonged infusions.  Nesiritide should not be used in patients with low cardiac filling pressures or in those with conditions that rely on venous return for adequate cardiac function.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Nesiritide is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out. Breastfeeding is not recommended for women with heart failure due to the high metabolic demands of lactation and breastfeeding; excretion of nesiritide in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long is the typical treatment with Nesiritide?** A: Nesiritide is typically administered as a short-term intravenous infusion, usually for a limited period (less than 48 hours) during an acute decompensated heart failure episode.

* **Q: Can I take Nesiritide orally?** A: No, Nesiritide is only available as an intravenous infusion.

* **Q: How is Nesiritide stored?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist. Generally, it should be stored under refrigeration.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Nesiritide is administered as a continuous infusion; there is no concept of a "missed dose." If the infusion is interrupted, consult with your healthcare provider.

* **Q:  Is Nesiritide a cure for heart failure?** A: No, Nesiritide is a treatment for acute decompensated heart failure; it does not cure heart failure. It's intended to provide short-term relief of acute symptoms.
