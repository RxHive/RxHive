# Nivolumab + Relatlimab
### Generic Name
Nivolumab + Relatlimab

### Usage

Nivolumab and Relatlimab is a combination immunotherapy used to treat unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age or older.  "Unresectable" means the cancer cannot be surgically removed, and "metastatic" means it has spread to other parts of the body.  This combination therapy targets specific proteins on immune cells to help the body's immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively.  Currently, this combination is primarily approved for melanoma; however, research into its potential use in other cancers is ongoing.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma):**  The recommended dosage is 480 mg of Nivolumab and 160 mg of Relatlimab administered intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Pediatric Dosage (Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma):** For patients 12 years of age or older weighing at least 40 kg, the dosage is the same as for adults: 480 mg of Nivolumab and 160 mg of Relatlimab IV every 4 weeks.  The safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are not routinely made for mild to moderate hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, for severe impairment, dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling due to unknown effects on the drug's pharmacokinetics (how the body processes the medication).  Dosage may be modified or treatment discontinued based on the severity of side effects. Specific guidelines for dose modifications due to toxicity are provided by the manufacturer and should be followed carefully by healthcare professionals.

### How it Works

Nivolumab is a PD-1 inhibitor. It works by blocking the PD-1 protein, which is found on certain immune cells (T cells).  Cancer cells often use the PD-1 pathway to evade detection and attack by the immune system.  By blocking PD-1, Nivolumab helps reactivate T cells, allowing them to recognize and destroy cancer cells.

Relatlimab is a LAG-3 inhibitor.  It blocks the LAG-3 protein, another protein that can suppress the immune response. By blocking LAG-3, Relatlimab enhances the activation of T cells, further strengthening the immune system's anti-tumor response. The combined effect of blocking both PD-1 and LAG-3 leads to a more potent anti-tumor immune response.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Interactions:**  This combination may interact with other medications.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your healthcare provider.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This combination can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least five months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least five months after the last dose.
* **Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions:**  This combination can cause serious immune-related side effects affecting various organs.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Allogeneic HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant):** Increased risk of complications if administered to patients who have received or are receiving an allogeneic HSCT.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** While generally no dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate impairment, caution is advised, and close monitoring is essential.
