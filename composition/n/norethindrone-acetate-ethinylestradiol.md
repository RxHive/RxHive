# Norethindrone Acetate + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Norethindrone Acetate + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage

Norethindrone acetate and ethinylestradiol is a combination oral contraceptive pill (OCP), commonly known as a birth control pill.  Its primary use is to prevent pregnancy. This is achieved through a multi-pronged mechanism (detailed below) that primarily suppresses ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  Secondary uses are sometimes considered for managing certain menstrual disorders, but this should only be done under the strict guidance of a healthcare provider, as it's not the primary indication.  The use of this medication for conditions other than contraception should be discussed with a doctor to determine if it's appropriate and safe.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (for contraception):**  The dosage regimen varies depending on the specific formulation and brand.  Generally, a 21-day cycle is followed. One tablet is taken daily at the same time for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break (during which withdrawal bleeding, similar to a menstrual period, usually occurs).  A new pack is then started on the eighth day, regardless of whether bleeding has stopped.  The first tablet in the pack is usually a different color to help ensure the regimen is started correctly.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of norethindrone acetate and ethinylestradiol have not been established in children. It is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are usually not necessary, but caution is advised in patients with kidney (renal) impairment.  The medication is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in patients with liver (hepatic) impairment.

### How it Works

Norethindrone acetate is a progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone), and ethinylestradiol is an estrogen.  Together, they prevent pregnancy by working in several ways:

1. **Ovulation Suppression:** The primary mechanism is suppressing ovulation, preventing the release of an egg.
2. **Cervical Mucus Changes:**  The hormones alter cervical mucus, making it thicker and less permeable to sperm, hindering sperm from reaching the egg.
3. **Endometrial Changes:** They also alter the lining of the uterus (endometrium), making it less receptive to a fertilized egg, reducing the chances of implantation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of or current: breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke, heart attack), thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes with vascular involvement, migraine with aura, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, benign or malignant liver tumors, hepatic impairment, or jaundice associated with previous oral contraceptive use, and pregnancy.  Allergies to any component of the medication are also a contraindication.


* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other drugs, particularly those affecting blood clotting or liver function.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Certain medications (like some antibiotics) can decrease the effectiveness of the pill.


* **Specific Populations:**  This medication should be used with caution in women with risk factors for blood clots, high blood pressure, or diabetes.  It's contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women who smoke should be aware of increased risks associated with using combined oral contraceptives.


* **Warnings:** Women should have regular check-ups while using this medication to monitor their health.  Discontinue use and contact your doctor immediately if you experience signs of thromboembolism (blood clots), such as chest pain, shortness of breath, sudden severe headache, or leg pain.  Also, discontinue use 4 weeks before any major surgery or prolonged immobilization.
