# Nabiximols (Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol)
### Generic Name
Nabiximols (Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol)

### Usage
Nabiximols is a combination medication containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), both derived from the *Cannabis* plant.  Its primary use is as an adjunctive therapy in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) to alleviate spasticity symptoms that haven't responded adequately to other treatments.  This means it's used *in addition to* other therapies, not as a standalone treatment.  It's specifically for spasticity, which is muscle stiffness and tightness, a common and debilitating symptom of MS.  Currently, there are no approved secondary uses for Nabiximols.

### Dosage
Nabiximols is administered as a buccal spray.  Dosage is highly individualized and titrated based on the patient's response and tolerance.

* **Initial Dose (Day 1):** One spray in the morning and one spray in the afternoon or evening (a total of two sprays).
* **Titration:** The dose may be increased by one spray daily as needed, up to a maximum of 12 sprays per day.  Some patients may tolerate higher doses, but experience is limited beyond 12 sprays.  Sprays should be spread evenly throughout the day during initial titration.
* **Usual Dosage:** 4-8 sprays per day.
* **Children and Adolescents:** Nabiximols is not recommended for use in individuals under 18 years old due to a lack of safety and efficacy data.
* **Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for mild renal impairment.  For moderate to severe hepatic impairment or renal impairment, use is generally not recommended.  If adverse reactions occur, the dosage should be reduced, the interval between doses extended, or the medication temporarily suspended until symptoms resolve.  Re-titration may be required.


### Side Effects
The side effects of Nabiximols can vary widely depending on the individual and the dose.  Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Nausea

Less common but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Confusion
* Vertigo
* Disorientation
* Depression
* Hallucinations
* Hypotension
* Tachycardia
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Blurred vision


  Rare side effects (less than 1% of patients) have also been reported.  It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Nabiximols's mechanism of action involves interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system.  THC and CBD act on cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) located throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and other areas of the body.  Activation of these receptors can influence pain pathways and muscle tone, helping to alleviate spasticity. The precise mechanisms by which it reduces spasticity in MS patients are still being investigated.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Nabiximols is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any formulation component, serious cardiovascular disease, a history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and in women or fertile men not using reliable contraception.  It is also contraindicated in children under 18.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nabiximols can interact with several other medications.  Strong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease its levels, while CYP3A4 inhibitors and certain other drugs can increase its levels. It may also interact with CNS depressants and sympathomimetics. Consult a healthcare professional about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Nabiximols can impair cognitive function and motor skills.  Patients should avoid activities requiring alertness (driving, operating machinery) until they know how the medication affects them.  Individuals with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, significant hepatic or renal dysfunction, or seizure disorders should use Nabiximols with caution.  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects.  Grapefruit juice should be avoided as it can increase Nabiximols's blood levels.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Nabiximols to work?** A: The onset of effect varies, but it typically takes several days to weeks for noticeable improvement in spasticity symptoms.  Individual responses differ.

* **Q: How should I store Nabiximols?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat.  Follow the instructions on the label.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Nabiximols?** A: Combining alcohol with Nabiximols is generally discouraged, as both can depress the central nervous system, leading to increased drowsiness and impaired coordination.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one. Follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: Can I suddenly stop taking Nabiximols?** A: No, you should not stop taking Nabiximols suddenly without consulting your doctor.  A gradual tapering of the dose may be necessary to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Is Nabiximols addictive?** A:  While Nabiximols contains cannabinoids, the risk of addiction is considered low compared to other substances, however, misuse and tolerance are possible, so it is essential to follow your doctor's guidance carefully.
