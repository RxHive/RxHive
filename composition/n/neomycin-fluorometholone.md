# Neomycin + Fluorometholone

**Generic Name:** Neomycin Sulfate and Fluorometholone

**Usage:**  This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eye and eyelid that respond to neomycin and inflammation that responds to fluorometholone. It's commonly used for conditions like bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) with significant inflammation.  The specific conditions will be determined by a doctor.  This medication is for external use only in the eye; it should never be injected or taken orally.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Eye Irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness.
* **Increased Eye Pressure (Glaucoma):** Especially with prolonged use.  This can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. Regular monitoring of eye pressure might be necessary.
* **Cataracts:** Increased risk with prolonged use.
* **Thinning of the Cornea:**  Prolonged use can make the cornea thinner and more susceptible to damage.
* **Secondary Infections:**  The medication can mask the symptoms of fungal or viral infections, potentially worsening them.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling.


**Rare but more serious side effects:**  Vision changes, eye pain, headache.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.

**How it Works:**

* **Neomycin Sulfate:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by stopping the growth of bacteria causing the infection.  It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Fluorometholone:** This is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye by suppressing the immune response.  It decreases the release of inflammatory mediators.  The combination of the antibiotic and steroid allows for the treatment of both the infection and the inflammation simultaneously.
