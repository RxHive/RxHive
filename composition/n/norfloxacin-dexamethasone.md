# Norfloxacin + Dexamethasone

**Generic Name:** Norfloxacin + Dexamethasone (often found as a combination ophthalmic solution)

**Usage:**  Norfloxacin + Dexamethasone is primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial eye infections.  The combination utilizes the antibiotic properties of norfloxacin and the anti-inflammatory properties of dexamethasone.  It's crucial to note that this medication is only effective against bacterial infections, not viral or fungal ones.  A doctor must diagnose the infection before prescribing it.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness
* **Temporary blurry vision**
* **Increased eye pressure (rare but important to monitor, especially in patients with glaucoma)**
* **Headache**
* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild itching to severe swelling. Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if you experience a severe allergic reaction.

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* **Development of fungal or viral infections (due to suppression of normal flora)**
* **Increased risk of corneal ulceration (especially with prolonged use)**


**How it Works:**

* **Norfloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting the enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) that bacteria need to replicate their DNA.  This ultimately stops the growth and spread of the bacteria causing the eye infection.

* **Dexamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye, helping to alleviate symptoms like redness, pain, and discomfort associated with the infection.  The anti-inflammatory action helps speed up healing.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  Improvement in symptoms should be seen within a few days, but the full course of treatment (usually 7-10 days) should be completed as directed by the doctor, even if symptoms improve.

* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using this medication?** A: Generally, no.  You should avoid wearing contact lenses while using this medication unless specifically instructed otherwise by your ophthalmologist.

* **Q: Can I use this medication for ear infections?** A: No. This medication is specifically formulated for ophthalmic (eye) use.  Using it in the ear could be harmful.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Use the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a side effect?** A: Contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.

* **Q: Can this medication be used in children?** A:  Use in children should be determined by a physician based on individual needs and benefits vs. risks.
