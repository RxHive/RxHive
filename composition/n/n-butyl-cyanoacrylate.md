# N-Butyl Cyanoacrylate
### Generic Name
N-Butyl Cyanoacrylate

### Usage
N-butyl cyanoacrylate is primarily used as a tissue adhesive in medical settings.  Its main application is in the closure of skin lacerations (cuts), acting as a fast-setting glue to stop bleeding and promote wound healing.  It's also employed to control bleeding from small blood vessels (vascular structures).  Furthermore, it finds application in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), abnormal tangles of blood vessels, and bleeding gastric varices (enlarged veins in the stomach).  In these cases, the glue is injected directly into the affected area under imaging guidance (angiography) to occlude (block) the abnormal vessels.

### Dosage
Dosage of N-butyl cyanoacrylate is highly dependent on the specific application and the size of the wound or affected area. It's not a medication administered in standard dosages like pills or syrups.  Instead, the amount used is determined by the healthcare professional based on clinical assessment. For skin lacerations, a small amount is applied directly to the wound edges.  For internal applications, like treating AVMs or varices, it's injected under close monitoring through specialized procedures.  Precise administration details are determined by the physician based on the patient's condition and the treatment strategy.  There are no specific pediatric or adult dosage guidelines as the amount used is determined based on the clinical needs, not patient age or weight.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Mild pain or burning sensation at the application site.
* Skin irritation or redness.
* Allergic reactions (though rare).

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Embolization (blockage of blood vessels) if used improperly in internal applications.
* Tissue necrosis (death of tissue) if the glue is applied inappropriately or extravasates (leaks) into surrounding tissues.
* Inflammation or infection at the application site.

**It is crucial to report any adverse effects to a healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works
N-butyl cyanoacrylate is a fast-acting adhesive.  When applied to a wound, it polymerizes (hardens) almost instantly, creating a strong bond between the tissue edges. This quick adhesion stops bleeding and effectively closes the wound, providing a protective barrier that promotes faster healing and reduces scarring compared to some other wound closure methods.  In the case of internal applications, it acts by physically blocking abnormal blood vessels, thereby stemming bleeding from AVMs or varices.

### Precautions
* **Allergic reactions:**  Prior testing may be necessary in individuals with known sensitivities to cyanoacrylate or similar compounds.
* **Improper application:**  Avoid contact with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth).  Care must be taken to prevent the glue from spreading to surrounding healthy tissue. Incorrect application can lead to serious complications.
* **Interaction with other drugs:**  Interactions with other medications are generally not considered clinically significant but should be discussed with a physician.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** The safety of N-butyl cyanoacrylate during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Consult a doctor before using this if pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Use in children should be supervised and only administered by a healthcare professional.
* **Internal use:** Internal application requires specialized training and should only be performed by qualified medical professionals under controlled conditions using appropriate imaging guidance.

### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for the glue to harden?**  A:  N-butyl cyanoacrylate sets within seconds to a few minutes, depending on the application and surrounding conditions.
* **Q: Is it waterproof?** A: Once hardened, the glue offers a degree of water resistance, but itâ€™s advisable to protect the treated area from prolonged immersion in water until it has fully healed.
* **Q: How is it removed?** A:  Generally, the glue falls off naturally as the wound heals.  Surgical removal is rarely required.
* **Q: Can I use it at home?** A: No.  N-butyl cyanoacrylate is a medical-grade adhesive that should only be applied by a healthcare professional. Improper use can lead to serious complications.
* **Q: What if the glue gets into my eyes?** A: Immediately flush your eyes with copious amounts of water and seek medical attention immediately.
