# Norgestrel + Ethinyl Estradiol
### Generic Name
Norgestrel + Ethinyl Estradiol

### Usage
Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is a combination birth control pill used primarily for contraception.  It prevents pregnancy by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening the cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg), and altering the uterine lining (making it less hospitable for a fertilized egg to implant). While its primary use is preventing pregnancy, some formulations might also be prescribed to manage certain menstrual irregularities, such as heavy bleeding or painful periods.  However, it's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* intended to treat these conditions alone; it's primarily a contraceptive.  A doctor should always be consulted to determine the suitability of this medication for managing menstrual issues.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation of the combined pill.  Each pill contains a specific amount of both norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol.  The dosage is usually one tablet taken orally once daily, at roughly the same time each day, for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break during which a withdrawal bleed (similar to a period) occurs.  Some formulations are designed for continuous use (28-day packs with inactive pills included), eliminating the withdrawal bleed.

**It is absolutely critical to follow the exact dosage and schedule prescribed by your doctor.**  There are no universally applicable pediatric or IV dosages for this combination pill; it's an oral contraceptive specifically designed for adult women. Any changes to the dosage or schedule should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  Improper usage can significantly reduce its effectiveness.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Breast tenderness
*   Headache
*   Nausea
*   Weight changes
*   Mood changes (including depression)
*   Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
*   Changes in libido

Less common, but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, include:

*   Severe abdominal pain
*   Chest pain
*   Shortness of breath
*   Leg pain or swelling (potential signs of blood clots)
*   Severe headache or vision changes (potential signs of stroke)
*   Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
This combination pill works through a hormonal mechanism.  Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen that mimics the body's natural estrogen, while norgestrel is a synthetic progestin (progesterone-like hormone).  These hormones work together to suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland.  These hormones are essential for ovulation. By suppressing FSH and LH, the combination pill prevents ovulation, thus preventing pregnancy.  The progestin also thickens cervical mucus and alters the uterine lining, creating additional barriers to fertilization and implantation.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, liver disease, or certain types of migraine headaches.  Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects when using this type of medication, especially in women over 35.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Many medications can interact with norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the pill or increasing the risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings for Vulnerable Groups:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use this medication.  Older women should discuss potential risks and benefits with their doctor before starting this medication, as the risk of certain side effects, such as blood clots, may be higher.

* **Safety Measures:**  Consistent daily use is crucial for effectiveness.  Missed pills should be handled according to the instructions provided with your specific brand.  Regular check-ups with your doctor are essential to monitor for any potential problems.
