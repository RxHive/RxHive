# Norgestrel + Ethinyl Estradiol

**Generic Name:** Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol

**Usage:**  Norgestrel and ethinyl estradiol is a combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) used primarily for birth control. It prevents pregnancy by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg), and altering the uterine lining (making it less hospitable for implantation of a fertilized egg).  It may also be prescribed off-label for certain hormonal conditions, but this should only be done under the supervision of a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary significantly from person to person and may include:

* **Common:**  Breast tenderness, weight changes (gain or loss), mood changes (including depression or irritability), nausea, vomiting, bloating, headaches, breakthrough bleeding (bleeding between periods), changes in menstrual flow (lighter or heavier periods), acne.
* **Less Common but More Serious:**  High blood pressure, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, gallbladder disease, liver tumors (rare), increased risk of cervical cancer (although this risk is generally considered low and is mitigated by regular Pap smears), changes in libido.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Jaundice, severe abdominal pain, vision changes, severe headaches or migraines.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  It's crucial to discuss any concerns or side effects with a healthcare provider.

**How it Works:** Norgestrel is a progestin (synthetic progesterone) and ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen.  The combination of these hormones works in several ways to prevent pregnancy:

* **Ovulation Suppression:** The hormones primarily work by preventing the pituitary gland from releasing the hormones that stimulate ovulation.
* **Cervical Mucus Thickening:** The hormones increase the thickness and stickiness of cervical mucus, creating a barrier that makes it difficult for sperm to penetrate and reach the egg.
* **Endometrial Changes:** The hormones alter the uterine lining, making it less likely that a fertilized egg will be able to implant.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How effective is it?** A: When taken correctly, Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol is highly effective at preventing pregnancy (typically over 99% effective).  However, human error in taking the pill regularly can reduce effectiveness.

* **Q: When should I take it?** A:  Follow the specific instructions on your prescription label and the patient information leaflet. Usually, this involves taking one pill at the same time each day.

* **Q: What if I miss a pill?** A:  The instructions on what to do if you miss a pill vary depending on the brand and the number of pills missed.  Consult the package insert or your doctor immediately if you miss a pill.

* **Q: Can I take it if I smoke?** A: Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious side effects, particularly blood clots, stroke, and heart attack, especially in women over 35.  You should discuss this with your doctor before starting the pill.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A:  Yes, several medications can interact with Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol.  Be sure to tell your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q: Can I breastfeed while taking this?** A:  Consult your doctor.  Small amounts of hormones can pass into breast milk, and the effects on the infant may vary.

* **Q: When can I stop taking it?** A:  Stop taking the pill only after consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to irregular bleeding and other issues.
