# Neomycin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Neomycin (Systemic)

### Usage

Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic with systemic use, primarily employed for three distinct purposes:

1. **Perioperative Surgical Prophylaxis:**  Neomycin is used orally before surgery to reduce the number of bacteria in the intestines. This helps prevent infections in the abdomen after surgical procedures, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. It's typically used in conjunction with other antibiotics and bowel preparation techniques.

2. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** This is a serious complication of liver disease where toxins build up in the blood, affecting brain function. Neomycin helps reduce the levels of ammonia, a major toxin, in the gut by killing ammonia-producing bacteria.  This leads to a reduction in symptoms like confusion, drowsiness, and altered mental status.

3. **Chronic Hepatic Insufficiency:**  In patients with chronic liver failure, Neomycin can help manage symptoms associated with hepatic encephalopathy and prevent its recurrence.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the indication and the patient's age and condition.  Always follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional. The information below is for general understanding only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Perioperative Surgical Prophylaxis:**  1 gram orally at 1 PM, 2 PM, and 11 PM on the day before surgery (8 AM surgery).  This is usually part of a broader bowel preparation strategy.

* **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** 4-12 grams daily, divided into doses given every 4-6 hours, for 5-6 days.

* **Chronic Hepatic Insufficiency:** 4 grams daily for an indefinite period (as determined by the doctor).


**Children:**

Dosage for children is not consistently established for all indications and requires careful calculation based on weight and the specific condition.  Use in children is often limited to specific situations and under close medical supervision.  Examples include:

* **Cholangitis Prophylaxis (after Kasai portoenterostomy):**  25-50 mg/kg/day divided into four doses, four days a week, until the child is 2-3 years old.  (Note: Safety and efficacy are not fully established in children.)

* **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** 50-100 mg/kg/day, divided into doses every 6 hours, for a maximum of 7 days, with or without lactulose. (Note: Safety and efficacy are not fully established in children).


**Important Note:**  Dosages should be adjusted based on factors like renal and hepatic function.  Always consult a healthcare professional for accurate dosing information.  The information provided here is for educational purposes only and should not be used as a guide for self-medication.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Anorectal pain
* Rectal irritation
* Mouth irritation/soreness

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* **Ototoxicity (damage to the ears):**  This can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and balance problems.
* **Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage):** This can cause changes in kidney function.
* **Neurotoxicity (damage to the nervous system):** This can present with symptoms ranging from numbness and tingling to seizures.


If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis.  It binds irreversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, preventing the bacteria from creating necessary proteins. This disruption leads to bacterial cell death and reduced bacterial growth.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Neomycin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to neomycin or other aminoglycosides, intestinal obstruction, or inflammatory/ulcerative gastrointestinal disease.

* **Drug Interactions:** Neomycin can interact with numerous drugs, potentially affecting their absorption, metabolism, or efficacy.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Neomycin should be used with caution in patients with kidney or liver problems, as these organs are responsible for its elimination.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Neomycin is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus. Its use during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against the benefits.  The drug's excretion in breast milk is not well-established.

* **Other Precautions:** Neomycin can cause malabsorption of certain nutrients.  Patients should be monitored for signs of nutritional deficiencies.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Neomycin without a doctor's prescription?**
A: No. Neomycin is a powerful antibiotic that should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Improper use can lead to serious side effects, including antibiotic resistance.

**Q: How should I store Neomycin?**
A: Store Neomycin as directed on the product label.  Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice on how to proceed.

**Q:  How long does it take to see results?**
A: The time it takes to see results depends on the indication.  For hepatic encephalopathy, improvements might take several days, whereas for perioperative prophylaxis, the benefit is seen in preventing postoperative infection.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects of Neomycin use?**
A: Long-term use of Neomycin can increase the risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.  Regular monitoring is important for patients on prolonged treatment.
