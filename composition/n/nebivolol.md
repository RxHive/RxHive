# Nebivolol

**Generic Name:** Nebivolol

**Usage:**

Nebivolol is a beta-blocker used primarily to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It helps lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular complications.
* **Chronic stable angina (chest pain):** It helps reduce the frequency and severity of angina attacks by slowing the heart rate and reducing the heart's workload.
* **Heart failure (in combination with other medications):**  It improves symptoms and reduces hospitalization risk in certain patients with heart failure.  It's typically used in conjunction with other heart failure medications.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Cold hands and feet
* Sleep disturbances
* Depression

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Worsening of heart failure
* Breathing problems (bronchospasm â€“ particularly in patients with asthma or COPD)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Vivid dreams or nightmares
* Hallucinations


**How it Works:**

Nebivolol is a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker.  This means it primarily affects beta-1 receptors located in the heart. By blocking these receptors, nebivolol:

* **Slows the heart rate:** This reduces the heart's workload and oxygen demand.
* **Reduces the force of heart contractions:** This further decreases the heart's workload.
* **Dilates blood vessels:** This lowers blood pressure by reducing resistance to blood flow.

The mechanism of action in heart failure is more complex and involves also influencing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and improving vascular function.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I stop taking nebivolol suddenly?** No, you should never stop taking nebivolol suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to serious complications, especially in patients with heart conditions. Your doctor will likely recommend a gradual tapering off of the medication.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking nebivolol?**  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of nebivolol, particularly dizziness and low blood pressure.  Limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **Can I take nebivolol with other medications?**  Nebivolol can interact with several other medications, including other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, certain antiarrhythmics, and insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness. If you experience any of these, seek immediate medical attention.
