# Nebivolol
### Generic Name
Nebivolol

### Usage
Nebivolol is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's a type of medication called a beta-blocker, specifically a selective beta-1 blocker. This means it primarily affects the heart, slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of its contractions, thereby lowering blood pressure. While its primary use is for hypertension, it may sometimes be considered in the management of other cardiovascular conditions under strict medical supervision.  This is not a standalone treatment and should always be part of a broader care plan guided by a physician.

### Dosage
Dosage for nebivolol varies depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage regimen precisely.

**Adults (Hypertension):**

* **Oral:** The typical starting dose is 5 mg once daily.  Your doctor may gradually increase the dose to a maximum of 40 mg once daily, at intervals of at least two weeks, depending on how well your blood pressure responds.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of nebivolol in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  Dosage adjustments are necessary depending on the severity of liver impairment. Individuals with mild impairment may not require dosage changes, but those with moderate impairment generally start with a lower dose (2.5mg once daily).  Nebivolol is contraindicated in individuals with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on kidney function (creatinine clearance). Individuals with severely reduced kidney function usually begin with a lower dose (2.5mg once daily).  Those with mild to moderate impairment may not require dosage adjustments.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Chest pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Decreased HDL cholesterol
* Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol)
* Increased serum triglycerides
* Increased uric acid
* Decreased platelet count
* Weakness
* Increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Acute pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Acute renal failure (kidney failure)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Atrioventricular block (heart rhythm disturbance)
* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)
* Claudication (pain in the legs during exercise)
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Peripheral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the extremities)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Vomiting

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Nebivolol is a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist.  This means it works by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) specifically on beta-1 receptors located primarily in the heart. By blocking these receptors, nebivolol slows down the heart rate and reduces the force of heart contractions, leading to lower blood pressure. It also causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) through the release of nitric oxide, further contributing to blood pressure reduction.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nebivolol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it, severe bradycardia, heart block (except those with a pacemaker), cardiogenic shock, decompensated heart failure, sick sinus syndrome (without a pacemaker), severe hepatic impairment, severe peripheral arterial circulatory disorders, and sinoatrial block.  Also contraindicated in individuals with rare hereditary conditions such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nebivolol can interact with many other medications.  It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specific interactions can lead to increased or decreased effects of nebivolol or other drugs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nebivolol is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Its use during pregnancy is generally avoided unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  It is not recommended during breastfeeding as its excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, compensated heart failure, hepatic or renal impairment, myasthenia gravis, peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud's disease, history of severe anaphylaxis, or bronchospastic disease.  Careful monitoring is necessary in these situations.  Nebivolol should not be abruptly stopped, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking nebivolol?**  A: It's generally advisable to limit alcohol consumption while taking nebivolol, as alcohol can lower blood pressure and increase the risk of side effects. Consult your doctor for specific advice.

* **Q: How should I store nebivolol?** A: Store nebivolol at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nebivolol suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking nebivolol suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Abrupt cessation can lead to serious complications, especially in individuals with coronary artery disease. Your doctor will advise on a safe tapering schedule.

* **Q: Does nebivolol cause weight gain?**  A: While weight gain isn't a commonly reported side effect, some individuals may experience fluid retention, leading to slight weight increase.  Discuss any significant weight changes with your physician.
