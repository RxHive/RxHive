# Norgestimate + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Norgestimate + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage
Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is a combination birth control pill primarily used to prevent pregnancy.  It's a combined hormonal contraceptive, meaning it contains both a progestin (norgestimate) and an estrogen (ethinyl estradiol).  This combination works by suppressing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus to hinder sperm passage, and altering the uterine lining to make implantation less likely.  In addition to contraception, this medication is also used to treat moderate acne vulgaris (severe acne) in female patients aged 15 years and older *only if* they also wish to use it for birth control. It is important to note that this medication is only indicated for women of reproductive age; it is not intended for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation) or after menopause.

### Dosage
**Contraception & Acne Vulgaris (in patients also desiring contraception):**

* **Oral:** One tablet daily, taken in the order presented on the blister pack.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for detailed instructions.

**Starting the medication:**

* **Day 1 Start:** Begin taking the pills on the first day of your menstrual cycle.
* **Sunday Start:** Begin taking the pills on the first Sunday after the onset of your menstrual cycle (if your period starts on a Sunday, begin on that day).  With a Sunday start, use a backup method of contraception for the first 7 days.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for patients with kidney impairment.  Use with caution and close monitoring of blood pressure is advised.
* **Switching from other contraceptives:**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on transitioning from another form of birth control to Norgestimate and Ethinyl estradiol. Instructions will vary based on the type of contraception being replaced (e.g., implant, injection, IUD, patch, vaginal ring).
* **Postpartum:** This medication should not be started within the first 4 weeks after childbirth due to an increased risk of blood clots.  If menstruation has resumed, follow the instructions for patients not currently on hormonal contraception.  If menstruation hasn't resumed, it's important to be aware that ovulation could occur before starting the medication.
* **Post-abortion/miscarriage:** The timing for starting this medication depends on whether the abortion or miscarriage occurred in the first or second trimester. Consult your doctor for specific guidance.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of Norgestimate and Ethinyl estradiol have been established only in women of reproductive age. It is not indicated for use before menarche.

### How it Works
Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is a combined oral contraceptive (COC) that prevents pregnancy through a multi-pronged mechanism. The estrogen and progestin work together to primarily suppress ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  It also thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. Finally, it alters the uterine lining, reducing the likelihood of a fertilized egg implanting.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** (Should not be used in these cases)

* Allergy to Norgestimate, ethinyl estradiol, or any component of the medication.
* History of breast cancer or other hormone-dependent cancers.
* Liver tumors (benign or malignant) or liver disease.
* Pregnancy.
* Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.
* Concomitant use with certain Hepatitis C medications (ombitasvir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir).
* High risk of arterial or venous blood clots (e.g., history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, stroke, heart attack).
* Uncontrolled high blood pressure.
* Migraine headaches with aura, especially in women over 35.
* Smoking (especially in women over 35).
* History of myocardial infarction (heart attack).
* Ocular lesions due to ophthalmic vascular disease.
* History of pancreatitis associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia.


**Warnings:**

This medication may increase the risk of blood clots, high blood pressure, liver problems, gallbladder disease, depression, and certain types of cancer.  Regular checkups are recommended.  Smoking significantly increases these risks, particularly in women over 35.
