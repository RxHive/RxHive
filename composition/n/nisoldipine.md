# Nisoldipine
### Generic Name
Nisoldipine

### Usage
Nisoldipine is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  Its main action is to relax blood vessels, thereby reducing the resistance to blood flow and lowering blood pressure. While not its primary indication,  Nisoldipine might be considered in certain cases of angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart), although other medications are generally preferred for this condition.  It's crucial to remember that Nisoldipine should only be used under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Nisoldipine comes in different extended-release formulations (hydrogel and coat-core tablets).  Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation and the patient's response.

* **Hydrogel Extended-Release Tablets:** The initial dose is typically 17 mg once daily.  This may be gradually increased by 8.5 mg per week, with at least a one-week interval between dose adjustments, up to a maximum of 34 mg once daily.  Elderly patients often start with a lower dose of 8.5 mg once daily, with slower titration.

* **Coat-Core Extended-Release Tablets:**  The starting dose is usually 20 mg once daily.  Similar to the hydrogel formulation, this can be increased in 10 mg increments per week, up to a maximum of 60 mg once daily.  Again, elderly patients typically begin with a lower dose of 10 mg once daily and titrate more slowly.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Nisoldipine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  Lower starting doses are recommended for patients with liver problems. For hydrogel tablets, the initial dose shouldn't exceed 8.5 mg; for coat-core tablets, it shouldn't exceed 10 mg.  Careful monitoring is necessary.

* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  Dosage adjustment is generally not needed for patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment.  However, for those with severe kidney impairment, dosage recommendations are not explicitly provided in manufacturer's guidelines, necessitating careful medical supervision.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)

**Less Common but Potentially Significant Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels, potentially leading to low blood pressure)
* Palpitations
* Exacerbation of angina
* Chest pain
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Sinusitis

**Rare Side Effects (<1%):** A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including but not limited to:  various cardiovascular issues (e.g., abnormal heart rhythms), neurological symptoms (e.g., abnormal dreams, amnesia), gastrointestinal problems (e.g., diarrhea, constipation), skin reactions (e.g.,  exfoliative dermatitis), and other systemic effects.  This list is not exhaustive.

**Important Note:**  If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above or any unusual symptoms, immediately consult your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Nisoldipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type.  It works by relaxing the muscles in the walls of blood vessels.  This relaxation, or vasodilation, reduces the resistance to blood flow, thus lowering blood pressure.  It primarily affects arteries, decreasing peripheral resistance (the resistance to blood flow in the smaller blood vessels).  While it also affects the heart muscle to a lesser extent, its primary action in treating hypertension is focused on vascular relaxation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nisoldipine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Nisoldipine, other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or any of the formulation's components.

* **Interactions:**  Nisoldipine interacts with numerous other medications, including some commonly used drugs. These interactions can either increase or decrease the effectiveness of Nisoldipine or the other medications involved, or lead to increased side effects.  It is imperative to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Nisoldipine.  Grapefruit juice can also interact significantly and should be avoided.

* **Warnings:** Nisoldipine should be used cautiously in patients with severe aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve), severe hepatic impairment, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction, congestive heart failure, and in elderly patients (over 65 years old).  Patients with a history of angina should be carefully monitored for worsening symptoms, especially when starting Nisoldipine or adjusting its dosage.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nisoldipine is classified as Category C for pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been definitively established.  The decision to use Nisoldipine during pregnancy should be made carefully by a doctor, weighing the risks and benefits.  It is unknown whether Nisoldipine is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Nisoldipine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to discuss all your current medications and supplements with your doctor before starting Nisoldipine. Many medications can interact with it.

* **Q: How should I store Nisoldipine?** A: Store Nisoldipine as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Can I crush or chew the Nisoldipine tablets?** A: No.  Nisoldipine tablets are extended-release formulations; crushing or chewing them will disrupt the controlled release mechanism, potentially leading to an overdose or unpredictable effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  When will I see results from Nisoldipine?** A:  The effects of Nisoldipine may vary, but it typically takes several weeks to achieve optimal blood pressure control. Regular monitoring is crucial.
