# Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate
### Generic Name
Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

### Usage
Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate is a combination medication used primarily to relieve cold and flu symptoms.  It's a common over-the-counter (OTC) remedy targeting several symptoms simultaneously.  Noscapine acts as an antitussive (cough suppressant), effectively reducing the urge to cough, particularly dry, non-productive coughs. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps alleviate symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or the common cold.  While primarily used for cold and flu symptoms, this combination may also provide temporary relief from similar symptoms associated with other upper respiratory illnesses.  It is important to note that this combination does not treat the underlying cause of the illness, but rather manages the symptoms.

### Dosage
Dosage for Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate varies depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the manufacturer, and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product packaging or as directed by a healthcare professional.  

**Adults:**  Typical adult dosages are usually specified on the product label and may range from one to two tablets or a specific amount of syrup every 4-6 hours, not to exceed a certain maximum daily dose.

**Children:**  Dosage for children is strictly weight-based and age-dependent.  Never administer adult formulations to children.  Always consult the product labeling for pediatric dosage information or seek guidance from a pediatrician or pharmacist.  Many formulations are not recommended for very young children (often under 6 years).  Syrups are commonly used for children, with carefully measured doses based on weight or age recommendations on the product label.

**Oral Administration:**  Oral forms (tablets, capsules, syrup) should be taken with a full glass of water.

**IV Administration:**  This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Intravenous administration is only applicable to individual components under strict medical supervision in a hospital setting, and not as a combination.

**Important Note:**  Exceeding the recommended dosage can lead to adverse effects.  If symptoms persist or worsen, or if new symptoms develop, consult a doctor.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness

If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Noscapine works centrally in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't directly affect the cause of the cough but reduces the urge to cough by interfering with signals sent to the brain. Chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens or irritants. By blocking histamine, chlorpheniramine maleate helps to reduce inflammation and the associated symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
