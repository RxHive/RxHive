# Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Noscapine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve cold and allergy symptoms.  Noscapine acts as a mild antitussive (cough suppressant), while chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and itching.  It's typically used for the symptomatic relief of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms associated with the common cold, influenza, and allergies.  It's important to note that this medication does *not* treat the underlying cause of the illness.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of both noscapine and chlorpheniramine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:** This can be managed by drinking plenty of fluids.
* **Constipation:** Increase fluid and fiber intake to mitigate this.
* **Headache:** Usually mild and resolves on its own.
* **Dizziness:** Avoid activities requiring alertness if experiencing dizziness.
* **Nausea:**  Infrequent, but possible.

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or a rapid heartbeat.
* **Fast heartbeat (tachycardia):**  Consult your doctor if you experience this.
* **Difficulty urinating:**  This is more common in men with prostate problems.
* **Blurred vision:**  Consult your doctor if this occurs.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Consult the product packaging or a healthcare professional for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

* **Noscapine:** This is an opiate derivative, but unlike many other opiates, it primarily acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex without significant opioid-related side effects like euphoria or dependence.  It does not have significant analgesic (pain-relieving) properties.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens.  By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms associated with allergies and the common cold, such as runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
