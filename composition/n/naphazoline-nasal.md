# Naphazoline (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Naphazoline (Nasal)

### Usage
Naphazoline nasal spray is a decongestant used for the temporary relief of nasal congestion.  This congestion can stem from various causes, including the common cold, upper respiratory allergies (like hay fever), or sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses).  It primarily works by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, thus opening them up and improving airflow.  It's important to note that naphazoline only provides temporary relief and does not treat the underlying cause of the congestion.

### Dosage
**Adults (12 years and older):**  For nasal congestion, the typical dosage is 2-4 drops or sprays of a 0.05% solution in each nostril, up to 4-6 times daily.  The maximum daily dose is 48 drops.  It's crucial to avoid continuous use for more than 5 days.

**Children (under 12 years):**  Naphazoline nasal spray is generally not recommended for children under 12 years old. Always consult a doctor before using this medication in children.

**Important Administration Instructions:**  Gently blow your nose before using the spray.  Tilt your head back slightly and spray the medication into each nostril as directed.  Avoid touching the tip of the spray bottle to your nose to prevent contamination.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Nasal cavity pain
* Burning sensation in the nose
* Temporary irritation (stinging, burning, sneezing)


Less common, but more serious side effects, especially in older adults, can include:

* Worsening of cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Worsening of hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Nausea
* Exacerbation of diabetes mellitus


If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.  Prolonged or excessive use can lead to rebound congestion, meaning the congestion returns worse than before.


### How it Works
Naphazoline is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist. This means it works by stimulating specific receptors (alpha-1 adrenergic receptors) in the blood vessels of the nasal passages. This stimulation causes vasoconstrictionâ€”the narrowing of blood vessels.  By reducing blood flow to the swollen nasal membranes, the nasal passages become less congested, allowing for easier breathing.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Naphazoline nasal spray should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to naphazoline or other components of the medication.  It's also contraindicated in individuals with:

* Cardiac disease
* Angle-closure glaucoma
* Children under 12 years of age


**Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with:

* Cardiovascular disease (hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease)
* Diabetes mellitus
* Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate)
* Open-angle glaucoma
* Chronic bronchial asthma


**Drug Interactions:** Naphazoline can interact with several medications, including:

* Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blockers
* Antiarrhythmics
* Antihypertensives
* Antipsychotics
* Caffeine
* Cardiac glycosides
* Ergot derivatives
* MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)
* Norepinephrine/noradrenaline transport inhibitors
* Sympathomimetics
* Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential interactions.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Naphazoline is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  Its excretion in breast milk is also unknown. Consult your doctor before using naphazoline if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I use naphazoline nasal spray?**  A:  Do not use for more than 5 consecutive days. Prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion.
* **Q: Can I use naphazoline nasal spray with other nasal medications?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining naphazoline with other nasal medications to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally swallow some naphazoline?** A: Contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately.
* **Q: How should I store naphazoline nasal spray?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep out of reach of children.
