# Nepafenac
### Generic Name
Nepafenac

### Usage
Nepafenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used primarily to manage pain and inflammation in the eye following cataract surgery.  Its primary use is to reduce post-operative discomfort and promote healing.  It's specifically designed for ophthalmic (eye) application.

### Dosage
The dosage of nepafenac varies depending on the concentration of the ophthalmic suspension and the specifics of the surgical procedure.

**Adults (including those â‰¥10 years old):**

* **0.1% Suspension:**  One drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily (TID), starting one day before surgery, continuing on the day of surgery, and for the following two weeks.
* **0.3% Suspension:** One drop in the affected eye(s) once daily (OD), starting one day before surgery, continuing on the day of surgery, and for the following two weeks. An additional drop should be administered 30-120 minutes before the surgery.


**Children:**  The dosage for children aged 10 years and older is the same as for adults.  Nepafenac is not generally recommended for children under 10 without specific guidance from an ophthalmologist.


**Administration:**  Always shake the suspension well before use. Avoid touching the tip of the container to any surface to prevent contamination.  If using other eye drops, wait at least 5 minutes between applications.  Using separate bottles for each eye is recommended, especially after surgery on both eyes, to minimize infection risk.  Remove contact lenses before administering the medication.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Headache
* Foreign body sensation in the eye
* Eye discomfort, pain, or itching
* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye
* Redness or swelling of the eye (conjunctival or corneal edema)
* Increased eye watering (lacrimation)
* Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
* Sticky sensation in the eye
* Crusting of the eyelids
* Nausea and vomiting
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Sinusitis


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include increased intraocular pressure and decreased visual acuity.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works
Nepafenac is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form (amfenac) in the body.  Amfenac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, nepafenac helps to decrease both pain and inflammation in the eye.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Nepafenac is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to nepafenac, other NSAIDs, or any components of the formulation.  It should be used cautiously in patients with aspirin/NSAID sensitivity.
* **Asthma/Allergies:**  Individuals with a history of asthma, urticaria (hives), or acute rhinitis triggered by aspirin or other NSAIDs should avoid nepafenac.
* **Bleeding:**  Nepafenac may increase bleeding time. Patients with bleeding disorders or those taking medications that affect blood clotting should use it with caution.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nepafenac is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against the potential risks.  It is unknown if nepafenac is excreted in breast milk; caution is advised for breastfeeding mothers.
* **Other Medications:**  Nepafenac may interact with other eye drops, particularly prostaglandins and corticosteroids.  Consult your doctor or ophthalmologist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Ocular Conditions:**  Use caution in patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, ocular surface disease, or repeat ocular surgeries (within a short timeframe).


### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use nepafenac?**  A:  Typically, nepafenac is used for two weeks following cataract surgery, as directed by your ophthalmologist.
* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using nepafenac?** A: No, you should remove contact lenses before applying nepafenac, especially those containing benzalkonium chloride.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is nepafenac safe for children?** A:  It's generally not recommended for children under 10 years without specific guidance from a doctor.
