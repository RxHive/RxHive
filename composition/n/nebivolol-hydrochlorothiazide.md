# Nebivolol + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Nebivolol and Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  Nebivolol is a beta-blocker that slows the heartbeat and makes the heart work less hard. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that helps your body get rid of extra salt and water, which lowers blood pressure.  This combination is prescribed when treatment with either drug alone is insufficient.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Nebivolol and Hydrochlorothiazide can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects may include:

* **From Nebivolol:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, cold hands and feet, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, and nightmares.  Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include slow heart rate (bradycardia), worsening of heart failure, and bronchospasm (wheezing) in individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* **From Hydrochlorothiazide:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, dehydration, frequent urination, low blood pressure (hypotension), muscle cramps, weakness, increased sensitivity to sunlight, and electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium, magnesium).  Rare but serious side effects include allergic reactions and kidney problems.
* **Combined Side Effects:** The combination of the two drugs may increase the risk of some side effects, especially those related to low blood pressure or electrolyte imbalances.


**How it Works:**

* **Nebivolol:** This beta-blocker works by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on the heart and blood vessels. This slows down the heart rate, reduces the force of heart contractions, and relaxes blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** This thiazide diuretic works by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine.  By reducing the amount of fluid in the bloodstream, it lowers blood pressure.

The combined effect of both medications provides a more significant reduction in blood pressure than either drug alone.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly, as it can lead to a dangerous rebound effect in blood pressure.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose before you stop taking it completely.
