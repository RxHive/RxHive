# Nefopam
### Generic Name
Nefopam

### Usage
Nefopam is a non-opioid analgesic medication primarily used for the management of both acute and chronic pain.  This includes a wide range of pain types, such as postoperative pain (pain after surgery), dental pain, musculoskeletal pain (pain in muscles and bones), cancer pain, and acute traumatic pain (pain from injuries).  While its primary use is pain relief, it's important to note that it's not a first-line treatment for all types of pain and its suitability should always be determined by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
Dosage for nefopam varies greatly depending on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, intravenous), the patient's age, and the severity of their pain.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is typically 60 mg three times a day (TID).  Geriatric patients may start with a lower initial dose of 30 mg TID.  The maintenance dose usually ranges from 30 to 90 mg TID.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** The usual dose is 20 mg every 6 hours as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 120 mg.  IM and IV administration should generally be avoided in geriatric patients.
* **Intravenous (IV) bolus infusion:** 20 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 120 mg.
* **Intravenous (IV) continuous infusion:** The usual dose is 5 mg/hour, which may be temporarily increased to 7.5 mg/hour if necessary. The maximum cumulative dose remains at 120 mg per 24 hours.


**Children:**

* The use of nefopam in children is generally limited, with specific dosage information requiring careful consideration and guidance from a pediatrician.  In children 12 years and older, the dosage may be similar to the adult oral dose; however, IM and IV administration is typically restricted to adolescents 15 years or older and at the adult dosage.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, particularly in individuals with severe kidney disease.  Always consult a doctor for appropriate dosage modifications in these cases.

### Side Effects

Nefopam, like other medications, can cause side effects.  These vary in frequency and severity.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Nausea and vomiting


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Urinary retention
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Syncope (fainting)

A range of other less frequent side effects are possible, including neurological effects like confusion and hallucinations.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Nefopam is a centrally acting non-opioid analgesic. This means it works within the central nervous system to reduce pain signals without directly affecting opioid receptors. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.  This modulation of neurotransmitter levels helps to alleviate pain perception.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Nefopam is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication, a history of seizures, those who have recently received MAOIs, myocardial infarction (heart attack), urinary retention due to urinary or prostatic obstruction (for injection only), angle-closure glaucoma (for injection only), and children under 15 years old (for injection only).
* **Interactions:** Nefopam can interact with many other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.  Significant interactions can occur with MAOIs, CNS depressants, and certain anticholinergic medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of nefopam during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless explicitly advised by a doctor.
* **Geriatric Patients and Patients with Impaired Liver or Kidney Function:** Caution should be exercised when administering nefopam to older adults and those with liver or kidney problems.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Nefopam can cause drowsiness and dizziness. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take nefopam with other pain relievers?** A:  It's essential to discuss taking nefopam alongside other pain relievers with your doctor.  Interactions can occur, potentially leading to adverse effects.

* **Q: How should I store nefopam?** A: Store nefopam as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.
