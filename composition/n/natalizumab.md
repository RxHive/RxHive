# Natalizumab

**Generic Name:** Natalizumab

**Usage:**

Natalizumab is a prescription medication used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease.  Specifically, it's used for:

* **Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS):**  To reduce the frequency of relapses and to slow the progression of disability in patients with highly active disease.
* **Crohn's disease:** To induce and maintain remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.

It's important to note that Natalizumab is a *last-line therapy*, meaning it's typically used after other treatments have proven ineffective.


**Side Effects:**

Natalizumab carries a significant risk of serious side effects, the most notable being **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**. PML is a rare but often fatal brain infection caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV).  The risk of PML is increased in patients with prior exposure to JCV and those with higher levels of JCV antibodies in their blood.

Other potential side effects include:

* **Infections:** Increased risk of various infections, including upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and opportunistic infections.
* **Infusion reactions:**  Reactions such as headache, nausea, fever, chills, and rash can occur during or after infusion.
* **Hepatitis:** Liver inflammation.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions.
* **Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache:** These are common but usually mild side effects.


**How it Works:**

Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking the adhesion molecule α4-integrin.  This molecule is found on the surface of certain white blood cells (leukocytes), which are involved in the inflammatory processes that cause damage in MS and Crohn's disease. By blocking α4-integrin, Natalizumab prevents these white blood cells from migrating into the central nervous system (in MS) and the gut (in Crohn's disease), thus reducing inflammation and disease activity.


**FAQs:**

* **How is Natalizumab administered?**  It's administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.  Infusion typically takes about 1 hour.
* **How often is Natalizumab given?** It's usually given every 4 weeks.
* **What are the monitoring requirements for Natalizumab?**  Regular monitoring for JCV antibodies and neurological symptoms is crucial to detect PML early.  Patients also undergo regular blood tests to check for other side effects.
* **What are the contraindications for Natalizumab?**  It's contraindicated in patients with active, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or known JCV infection.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should also avoid it unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms, especially neurological symptoms (e.g., weakness, numbness, vision changes), or signs of infection.
* **Is there a generic version of Natalizumab available?**  While brand-name Tysabri is commonly known, biosimilar versions of natalizumab may be available depending on your region and healthcare system.  Check with your doctor or pharmacist for availability.
