# Natalizumab
### Generic Name
Natalizumab

### Usage
Natalizumab is a prescription medication primarily used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults who haven't responded well to or can't tolerate other treatments.  It works by reducing the inflammation in the central nervous system that causes MS relapses.  It's also approved to treat moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults.  In Crohn's disease, it's used for patients who haven't had success with standard treatments like conventional therapies and TNF-alpha inhibitors.  It's crucial to understand that Natalizumab should not be used in combination with other immunosuppressants or TNF-alpha inhibitors.

### Dosage
Natalizumab is administered intravenously (IV) as a 300 mg infusion over one hour.  For both multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, the typical dosage is every 4 weeks.  

* **Multiple Sclerosis:**  Natalizumab is used as monotherapy in patients who have not responded adequately to or cannot tolerate other treatments. The 300mg infusion is given every 4 weeks.

* **Crohn's Disease:** The 300 mg infusion is given every 4 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued if there's no improvement within the first 12 weeks. If a patient is already on corticosteroids, tapering should begin once Natalizumab shows benefit.  Treatment should be stopped if the patient can't be weaned off corticosteroids within 6 months, or if additional corticosteroid use exceeds 3 months per year beyond the initial taper.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Natalizumab in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Natalizumab can cause several side effects, ranging in severity.  Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* Depression
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Flu-like symptoms
* Upper and lower respiratory tract infections
* Abdominal distress
* Nausea
* Skin rash
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Limb pain
* Urinary tract infection
* Infusion-related reactions

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (affecting less than 10% of patients) include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Serious infections (including opportunistic infections like progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy – PML)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) – a rare but potentially fatal brain infection.
* Meningitis and encephalitis
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha-4 subunit of integrin molecules.  These molecules play a crucial role in the movement of immune cells (leukocytes) from the bloodstream into inflamed tissues. By blocking the interaction of integrins with receptors in blood vessels, Natalizumab prevents leukocytes from entering the brain (in MS) or the gut (in Crohn's disease), thus reducing inflammation and disease activity.


### Precautions
Natalizumab carries significant risks, and its use requires careful monitoring.  

* **Contraindications:** Natalizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, hypersensitivity to murine proteins, active or prior progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or those with immunosuppression due to conditions like HIV, leukemia, lymphoma, or immunosuppressant/antineoplastic therapy.

* **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):** This is a serious and potentially fatal brain infection linked to Natalizumab.  The risk of PML increases with longer treatment duration and the presence of anti-JC virus antibodies. Regular monitoring for PML symptoms is crucial.

* **Infections:** Natalizumab suppresses the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Natalizumab is a Pregnancy Category C drug.  The potential risks to the fetus should be weighed against the benefits of treatment. It's excreted in breast milk, and a decision to breastfeed should consider the risks to the infant.

* **Drug Interactions:** Natalizumab should not be used with other immunosuppressants or TNF-alpha inhibitors.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Natalizumab?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the condition and individual response. For Crohn's disease, it is typically assessed at 12 weeks.

* **Q: How is Natalizumab stored?** A: Store Natalizumab under refrigeration. Allow it to reach room temperature before administration.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to reschedule your infusion.

* **Q: Are there any specific tests I need to undergo while taking Natalizumab?** A: Yes, regular monitoring, including blood tests and brain MRI scans (especially for PML),  are essential while on this medication.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Natalizumab?** A: Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor. It's advisable to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while on immunosuppressants.

* **Q:  What are the signs and symptoms I should watch for that could indicate PML?** A:  Symptoms can be subtle and include progressive weakness, difficulty walking or talking, vision changes, memory loss, or confusion.  If you experience any unusual neurological symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.
