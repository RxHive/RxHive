# Necitumumab
### Generic Name
Necitumumab

### Usage
Necitumumab is a medication used in the treatment of metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  It's specifically indicated for first-line treatment, meaning it's used when the cancer has spread and hasn't been treated with other systemic therapies before.  It's crucial to understand that Necitumumab is *not* used to treat non-squamous NSCLC.  It's always administered in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, typically gemcitabine and cisplatin.

### Dosage
Necitumumab is given intravenously (IV). The standard dosage for adults with metastatic squamous NSCLC is 800 mg on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week treatment cycle. This is administered alongside gemcitabine and cisplatin. Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or the side effects become intolerable.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dosage might need adjustment based on side effects. For instance, if a patient experiences a grade 3 rash, the dose may be reduced to 400 mg temporarily, then gradually increased.  Severe side effects may necessitate permanent discontinuation of Necitumumab.  Specific adjustments are made based on the severity of side effects and are determined by a healthcare professional.  There are no specific dosage adjustments for mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment or renal impairment noted in the prescribing information, although this does not exclude the possibility of a need for dosage adjustments depending on the patient's clinical condition.  Dosage adjustments for pediatric patients are not established.

### Side Effects
Necitumumab can cause several side effects, some common and some less frequent but potentially serious.  

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Skin toxicity (rash, acne)
* Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels)
* Hypocalcemia (low calcium levels)
* Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Weight loss


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**

* Venous or arterial thromboembolic events (blood clots)
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs)
* Cardiopulmonary arrest
* Severe skin reactions
* Infusion-related reactions


Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Necitumumab is a monoclonal antibody.  It works by targeting and binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on cancer cells.  EGFR is a protein that helps cancer cells grow and divide. By binding to EGFR, Necitumumab blocks the action of this protein, preventing cancer cell growth and promoting their death.  It also triggers the destruction of EGFR-expressing cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

### Precautions
* **Cardiopulmonary arrest:** A boxed warning highlights the risk of cardiopulmonary arrest and sudden death.  Close monitoring of electrolyte levels (magnesium, potassium, calcium) is crucial.
* **Hypomagnesemia:**  Necitumumab frequently causes hypomagnesemia (low magnesium).  Careful monitoring and electrolyte replacement are essential.  Similarly, hypocalcemia and hypokalemia are frequently seen.
* **Thromboembolic events:** Necitumumab increases the risk of blood clots (venous and arterial thromboembolic events).
* **Infusion reactions:** Infusion-related reactions can occur. Careful monitoring during infusion is necessary.
* **Dermatological toxicities:** Skin reactions, including rash and acne, are common.
* **Pregnancy:** Necitumumab can harm a developing fetus.  Effective contraception is necessary for women of childbearing age.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for three months after.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  While no specific dosage adjustments are provided in the prescribing information for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, careful monitoring is essential.
