# Nortriptyline
### Generic Name
Nortriptyline

### Usage
Nortriptyline is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (unipolar depression).  It's a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), working by affecting the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain.  While its primary indication is depression, nortriptyline also sees off-label use in managing various types of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain (nerve pain), diabetic neuropathy, myofascial pain, orofacial pain, and postherpetic neuralgia (shingles-related nerve pain).  It's also sometimes used off-label to aid in smoking cessation.  It's important to note that these off-label uses are not universally accepted and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and individual response.  It's usually started at a low dose and gradually increased under a doctor's supervision.

* **Major Depressive Disorder:**  Typically starts at 25 mg once daily, increasing to 25-75 mg daily in divided doses (e.g., 25 mg three times a day). Maximum daily dose is usually 150 mg.  The total daily dose can sometimes be given once daily.
* **Chronic Pain (Off-label):**  Initial doses are typically lower, starting at 10-25 mg at bedtime and gradually increasing up to 150 mg/day as tolerated, but the dosage and frequency will depend on the specific type of chronic pain, and the physician's assessment.
* **Other Off-Label Uses:**  Dosages for other off-label uses like diabetic neuropathy or smoking cessation are also individualized and require careful titration under medical guidance.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Nortriptyline is not typically recommended for children due to safety concerns, except in specific situations and under extremely close medical supervision.  If prescribed for children, the dosage is carefully calculated based on weight and the specific condition.  It is used with caution in children for conditions like ADHD and enuresis (bedwetting) and typically involves a very low starting dose, gradually increased.  Precise pediatric dosages must always be determined by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems, as these organs play a role in the metabolism and excretion of the drug.  Consult a physician for guidance.  A careful tapering off period is crucial when stopping nortriptyline to avoid withdrawal symptoms.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Weight gain or loss
* Fatigue

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* High blood pressure
* Seizures
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially important to watch for, particularly at the beginning of treatment)
* Serotonin syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening condition)

If you experience any concerning side effects, it's vital to consult a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).  It primarily works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. These neurotransmitters play important roles in mood regulation and pain perception. By blocking the reuptake of these chemicals, nortriptyline makes more of them available in the synapses (connections between nerve cells), potentially alleviating symptoms of depression and chronic pain.  It also affects other neurotransmitters like histamine and acetylcholine, which can contribute to some of its side effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nortriptyline should not be used by individuals with certain conditions, including hypersensitivity to the drug, acute recovery phase after a heart attack, or those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) – a specific type of antidepressant—within 14 days of starting or stopping nortriptyline.  
* **Drug Interactions:**  Nortriptyline interacts with many other medications, including other antidepressants, pain relievers, and some over-the-counter drugs. This can affect its effectiveness and increase the risk of side effects. Thoroughly inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nortriptyline is generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the developing fetus or nursing infant. However, a pregnant woman stable on the medication may continue it while breastfeeding under close medical supervision.
* **Elderly and Vulnerable Populations:**  Older adults are particularly susceptible to side effects, such as orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing).  The dosage should be carefully monitored and started at a lower dose.
* **Suicidal Thoughts:**  Nortriptyline, like other antidepressants, carries a risk of worsening suicidal thoughts, especially at the start of treatment or when doses are changed.  Close monitoring is essential.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking nortriptyline?**  A: It's best to avoid alcohol while on nortriptyline, as it can increase drowsiness and other side effects.
* **Q: How should I store nortriptyline?**  A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can I stop taking nortriptyline suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication, as a gradual tapering-off process is usually required.
* **Q:  How long does it take for nortriptyline to work?** A: It can take several weeks to notice a significant improvement in symptoms.
