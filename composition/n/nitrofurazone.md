# Nitrofurazone

**Generic Name:** Nitrofurazone

**Usage:**

Nitrofurazone is a topical antibacterial agent used to prevent or treat infections of minor burns, wounds, and ulcers.  It's typically applied to the affected area as a cream, ointment, or solution.  It's important to note that it is **not** for systemic use (i.e., swallowing it or injecting it) and is only intended for external application.  Its use should be limited to superficial wounds and should not be used for deep wounds or serious infections.  A doctor's guidance is recommended, particularly for larger or more severe wounds.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Irritation at the application site:  This can manifest as redness, itching, or burning.
* Allergic reactions: While uncommon, allergic reactions can range from mild skin rashes to more severe symptoms. Stop use and seek medical attention if an allergic reaction is suspected.

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Hypersensitivity:  Severe allergic reactions requiring immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

Nitrofurazone is a nitrofuran derivative that inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with their metabolic processes.  Specifically, it interferes with bacterial enzyme systems, leading to the disruption of DNA and RNA synthesis, thus preventing bacterial replication and killing existing bacteria.  It's effective against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
