# Neratinib
### Generic Name
Neratinib

### Usage
Neratinib is a targeted therapy used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer.  Its primary use is as an extended adjuvant treatment for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer following initial treatment with trastuzumab-based therapy. This means it's given after the main cancer treatment to help prevent the cancer from returning.  Neratinib is also used in combination with capecitabine to treat adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer that has progressed despite two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens.  In simpler terms, it's used for patients whose cancer has spread and hasn't responded well to other treatments.

### Dosage

**Early-Stage Breast Cancer (Extended Adjuvant Treatment):** The recommended dose is 240 mg (six tablets) once daily orally with food. This is typically taken continuously for up to one year, or until the cancer returns. A dose escalation strategy may be used to improve tolerability, starting at 120 mg daily for the first week, increasing to 160 mg daily in the second week, and then to the full 240 mg dose from day 15 onwards.  Antidiarrheal prophylaxis (usually loperamide) is usually recommended for the first 8 weeks of treatment, even with dose escalation.

**Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer (in combination with capecitabine):** The recommended dose of Neratinib is 240 mg once daily orally with food, given on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle.  Capecitabine is given concurrently at a dose of 750 mg/mÂ² twice daily on days 1-14 of the same cycle. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.  Similar to early-stage treatment, a dose-escalation strategy might be used and antidiarrheal prophylaxis is commonly employed.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on liver function (hepatic impairment), and the severity of side effects, particularly diarrhea.  The drug's label does not specify adjustments for kidney function (renal impairment), but renal function typically doesn't significantly impact Neratinib pharmacokinetics. Specific adjustments are made based on the severity of adverse events.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Muscle spasms
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe diarrhea leading to dehydration, hypotension (low blood pressure), and potentially renal failure.
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):  Liver enzyme elevation.
* Interstitial lung disease.

**Important Note:**  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Neratinib is a kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the activity of certain enzymes called tyrosine kinases, specifically those found in the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), HER2, and HER4 families.  These enzymes play a crucial role in the growth and spread of cancer cells. By inhibiting these kinases, Neratinib disrupts the signaling pathways that drive the growth of HER2-positive breast cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Neratinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to Neratinib or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Neratinib interacts with several other medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Strong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease Neratinib's effectiveness, while strong inhibitors can increase its levels in the body, potentially leading to heightened side effects. Concurrent use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor antagonists, and antacids should be carefully managed due to potential interactions affecting absorption.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Neratinib can harm a developing fetus; women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with moderate to severe liver impairment.
* **Diarrhea Management:**  Diarrhea is a common and potentially serious side effect.  Patients should be instructed on managing diarrhea with antidiarrheal medications, increased fluid intake, and dietary adjustments.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Neratinib?** A: Store Neratinib tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Skip the missed dose and resume your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Neratinib?** A: No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit products as they can interact with Neratinib.
* **Q: How long will I be on Neratinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your specific situation and your healthcare provider's recommendations. For adjuvant treatment, it's typically up to one year.
* **Q: What are the signs of a severe allergic reaction?** A: Signs may include hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and severe skin reactions. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Q:  Is Neratinib safe for children?** A: The safety and efficacy of Neratinib in children have not been established.
