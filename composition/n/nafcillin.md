# Nafcillin
### Generic Name
Nafcillin

### Usage
Nafcillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic.  Its primary use is to treat infections caused by susceptible penicillinase-producing staphylococci, a type of bacteria that produces an enzyme (penicillinase) capable of inactivating many penicillins.  These infections can affect various parts of the body, including skin, soft tissues, bones, and even the lining of the heart (endocarditis).  It's important to note that Nafcillin is *not* effective against infections caused by bacteria susceptible to penicillin G (another type of penicillin).  Nafcillin is sometimes used off-label to treat more severe infections like endocarditis, meningitis, and prosthetic joint infections caused by methicillin-susceptible *Staphylococcus aureus* (MSSA).  However, always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate usage.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the infection's severity, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM)).  The following are guidelines, and a healthcare professional will determine the correct dosage in each case.

**Adults:**  For susceptible bacterial infections, the typical dose is 0.5g every 4-6 hours, given either IV or IM.  The maximum daily dose is generally 12g. For more serious conditions like endocarditis or meningitis, much higher doses and longer treatment durations (often several weeks) are necessary, often involving combinations with other antibiotics.  Specific dosing for these conditions must be determined by a physician.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosing is complex and weight-based.  Infants, children, and adolescents may receive 50-200 mg/kg/day, divided into doses every 4-6 hours, depending on the severity of the infection.  Maximum daily doses are also weight-based and can be significantly higher than adult maximum doses. Neonatal dosing is further adjusted based on age and weight.  Precise dosages for children should always be determined and overseen by a pediatrician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Nafcillin can include:

* Local inflammation at the injection site (pain, swelling)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Rash

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Liver damage (elevated liver enzymes)
* Kidney problems (interstitial nephritis)
* Blood disorders (neutropenia, agranulocytosis)
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (a severe intestinal infection)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Nafcillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By preventing the bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, Nafcillin causes the bacteria to lyse (break open and die).  Its resistance to penicillinase makes it effective against bacteria that produce this enzyme, unlike many other penicillins.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:**  Nafcillin should not be used in individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or any of its components.  A history of severe allergies or asthma increases the risk of allergic reactions.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Nafcillin is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  Individuals with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments or close monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Nafcillin is classified as Pregnancy Category B, meaning studies in animals haven't shown risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It's important to weigh the benefits against potential risks.  Nafcillin is excreted in breast milk and may cause diarrhea or thrush in breastfed infants; careful monitoring is required.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nafcillin can interact with several other medications, including aminoglycosides, probenecid, and oral contraceptives.  Inform your healthcare professional about all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Nafcillin with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  Nafcillin can interact with some drugs, potentially affecting their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.
* **Q: How should I store Nafcillin?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, antibiotics should be kept in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Nafcillin?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the type and severity of the infection.  You may start feeling better within a few days, but the full course of treatment must be completed to ensure the infection is eradicated.
* **Q: Is Nafcillin safe for children?** A:  Yes, but pediatric dosing is critical and must be determined by a pediatrician.  The dosage is based on the child's weight and the infection's severity.
* **Q: What if I develop diarrhea while taking Nafcillin?** A:  Diarrhea can be a common side effect, but severe or persistent diarrhea could indicate a *C. difficile* infection, a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.
