# Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Boric Acid + Sodium Chloride + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Boric Acid + Sodium Chloride + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (This is a combination of ingredients, not a single generic name.  Each ingredient has its own generic name.)

**Usage:** This combination of ingredients is typically found in ophthalmic solutions (eye drops) used to relieve the symptoms of:

* **Allergic conjunctivitis:**  Inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye) due to allergies.  Symptoms include redness, itching, burning, and watery eyes.
* **Other eye irritations:**  While primarily used for allergies, it might be used to temporarily relieve minor eye irritation.

**Important Note:** This is not a prescription drug and its use should be limited to short-term relief.  Persistent or worsening eye irritation requires professional medical evaluation.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and the duration of use. Common side effects may include:

* **Burning or stinging:**  Upon initial application.
* **Eye irritation:** Redness, dryness, or itching.
* **Blurred vision:** Temporary.
* **Dilated pupils:**  Naphazoline's vasoconstrictive action.
* **Increased eye pressure:**  In susceptible individuals, particularly those with glaucoma. This is a serious concern.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible.  Symptoms may include swelling of the eyelids or face.


**How it Works:**

* **Naphazoline:** A vasoconstrictor, which means it narrows the blood vessels in the eyes, reducing redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, which blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions, thereby reducing itching and inflammation.
* **Boric Acid:** Acts as a buffering agent, helping to maintain the solution's pH balance and preserve its stability.
* **Sodium Chloride:**  Helps maintain the solution's osmotic balance (similar to the salt content of tears), making it less irritating to the eyes.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** A viscosity-increasing agent (thickener), which helps the solution stay in contact with the eye longer, improving efficacy.


**FAQs:**

* **How long can I use these eye drops?**  Do not use them for longer than a few days without consulting a doctor. Prolonged use of naphazoline can lead to rebound congestion (worsening of symptoms).
* **Can I use these eye drops if I have glaucoma or other eye conditions?** No, you should not use these eye drops without consulting your doctor first. Naphazoline can increase eye pressure.
* **Can I use these eye drops with other medications?** Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are using, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, to avoid potential interactions.
* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** Stop using the eye drops immediately and contact a doctor or seek medical attention.
* **Are these eye drops safe for contact lens wearers?**  Check the product label or consult your doctor.  Some formulations may not be compatible with contact lenses.
