# Norethindrone + Mestranol
### Generic Name
Norethindrone + Mestranol

### Usage
Norethindrone and Mestranol is a combination of a progestin (norethindrone) and an estrogen (mestranol).  Its primary use is as an oral contraceptive, meaning it prevents pregnancy.  However, it's important to note that mestranol-containing oral contraceptive formulations are largely discontinued due to safety concerns and have been replaced by newer, safer formulations using ethinylestradiol and norethisterone (or similar progestins).  Therefore, while this combination was historically used for birth control, it's rarely prescribed today.

### Dosage
Because mestranol-containing formulations are largely obsolete, specific dosage information for this exact combination is difficult to find and may vary depending on the now-discontinued brand.  Dosage would have been determined by a physician based on the individual's needs and medical history.  It's crucial to consult a doctor for current and safe contraceptive options.

### Side Effects
Since this combination is outdated, a comprehensive list of side effects might not be completely accurate or relevant to current medical practice.  However, side effects associated with *similar* oral contraceptives (containing ethinylestradiol and other progestins) include:

*   Breast tenderness
*   Weight changes
*   Mood changes (including depression)
*   Headaches
*   Nausea
*   Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
*   Changes in libido

Serious, though less common, side effects can include blood clots, stroke, heart attack, and liver problems.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.**  This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.

### How it Works
Norethindrone and Mestranol work by preventing pregnancy through a combination of mechanisms. Mestranol (the estrogen) suppresses the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This prevents the ovary from releasing an egg (ovulation). Norethindrone (the progestin) thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and it also alters the uterine lining, making it less hospitable for implantation.  Even if ovulation does occur, these changes reduce the chances of conception.

### Precautions
Because mestranol-containing formulations are no longer widely used, detailed precautions specific to this combination are hard to find. However, general precautions for *all* oral contraceptives, including those that use similar hormones, are:

* **Contraindications:** Oral contraceptives should not be used by individuals with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, certain types of cancer, liver disease, or unexplained vaginal bleeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Many medications can interact with oral contraceptives, potentially reducing their effectiveness.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings for Vulnerable Groups:**  Oral contraceptives may carry increased risks for women who smoke, are older than 35, have certain medical conditions, or are obese.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use oral contraceptives.


### FAQs
* **Q: Is Norethindrone + Mestranol still available?** A:  Formulations containing mestranol are largely discontinued. Modern oral contraceptives use different estrogens.
* **Q: What are safer alternatives?** A: Consult your doctor for current and safe contraceptive options, which will likely involve newer formulations with ethinylestradiol and other progestins.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a pill?** A:  This information is not applicable to this outdated formulation.  Follow the instructions provided with any current oral contraceptive you may be taking.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  This information is not applicable to this outdated formulation. Store any current medication according to its label instructions.
