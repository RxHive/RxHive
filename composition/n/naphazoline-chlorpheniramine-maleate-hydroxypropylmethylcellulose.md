# Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (This is a combination of three active ingredients)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is typically used as a nasal decongestant and antihistamine for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies.  Specifically:

* **Naphazoline:** A vasoconstrictor that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, thus reducing sneezing, runny nose, and itching.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** A lubricant and thickener. It helps to coat and soothe irritated nasal passages.

This combination is usually applied directly into the nostrils as a nasal spray or drops.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but common ones include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation** in the nose
* **Drowsiness** (especially with chlorpheniramine)
* **Dry mouth and throat**
* **Headache**
* **Rebound congestion** (worsening of congestion after the medication wears off, if used for extended periods)
* **Irritation or dryness** of the nasal passages
* **Nausea**
* **Dizziness**
* **Insomnia** (less common)
* **Increased heart rate** (less common)
* **High blood pressure** (less common)


**How it Works:**

* **Naphazoline:**  Works by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and congestion, making breathing easier.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from causing allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itching.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** Acts as a lubricant and thickener, soothing irritated nasal membranes.
