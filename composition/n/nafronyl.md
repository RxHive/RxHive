# Nafronyl
### Generic Name
Naftidrofuryl

### Usage
Naftidrofuryl, commonly known as Nafronyl, is primarily used to treat peripheral vascular disorders.  These are conditions affecting blood vessels supplying the limbs.  Specific conditions treated include intermittent claudication (pain in the legs during exercise), Raynaud's syndrome (reduced blood flow to the fingers and toes), night cramps, rest pain (pain in the limbs even at rest), incipient gangrene (early stages of tissue death), trophic ulcers (sores due to poor blood flow), diabetic arteriopathy (blood vessel damage related to diabetes), and acrocyanosis (bluish discoloration of the extremities).  Additionally, Naftidrofuryl is used in the treatment of certain cerebral vascular disorders, which affect the blood vessels in the brain.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescription.

* **Peripheral Vascular Disorders:** The typical dose is 100-200 mg three times a day (TID) orally.
* **Raynaud's Syndrome:**  A common dosage is 200 mg twice a day (BID) orally.
* **Cerebral Vascular Disorders:**  The typical dose is 100 mg three times a day (TID) orally.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Naftidrofuryl in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and a physician may adjust the dosage based on individual patient needs and response.

**Administration:** Naftidrofuryl is usually administered orally in the form of tablets or capsules.  It's important to swallow the medication whole with plenty of water to minimize the risk of esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Agitation
* Sleep disturbances

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus): This is more likely if the medication isn't taken with sufficient water.
* Hepatic failure (severe liver damage): This is rare but serious.
* Calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis (kidney stones):  This is a less common but serious risk, particularly with inadequate fluid intake.
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen)
* Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Naftidrofuryl is a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of serotonin (a neurotransmitter) at specific receptors in blood vessels.  This blockage leads to vasodilationâ€”the widening of blood vessels. This widening improves blood flow to the extremities and brain, relieving symptoms associated with peripheral and cerebral vascular disorders.  Additionally, Naftidrofuryl is thought to improve intracellular aerobic metabolism (the way cells use oxygen to produce energy), potentially protecting cells from damage caused by reduced blood flow.  It also has antispasmodic properties, helping to relax blood vessel walls.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Naftidrofuryl or any of its components.
* History of hyperoxaluria (excess oxalate in the urine) or recurrent calcium-containing kidney stones.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
* Use with caution in patients with congenital galactosemia, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or lactase deficiency (related to the tablet's excipients).
* Patients should be well hydrated to reduce the risk of kidney stones.
* The medication should be taken with food and a full glass of water to minimize the risk of esophageal irritation.
* Patients should avoid tasks requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, until they know how the medication affects them.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I crush or chew the Naftidrofuryl tablets?**

A: No, swallow the tablets or capsules whole with plenty of water to avoid esophageal irritation.

**Q: How should I store Naftidrofuryl?**

A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  Follow the storage instructions on the product label.

**Q:  Can I take Naftidrofuryl if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?**

A:  The safety of Naftidrofuryl during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless specifically directed by your physician.
