# Nimesulide + Paracetamol + Dextropropoxyphene

It's crucial to understand that **combining Nimesulide, Paracetamol (Acetaminophen), and Dextropropoxyphene is NOT a standard or recommended combination.**  Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic that has been largely withdrawn from the market due to its serious risks of overdose and cardiac effects.  Therefore, information on this specific combination is unavailable and potentially dangerous.  Prescribing or using this combination would be highly irresponsible.

While we can discuss each component individually,  it's vital to emphasize that you **should never attempt to combine these medications without explicit instruction from a qualified medical professional.**

* **Usage:** Pain reliever and fever reducer.
* **Side Effects:**  Rarely serious at recommended doses, but high doses can cause liver damage.  Allergic reactions are also possible.
