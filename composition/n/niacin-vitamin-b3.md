# Niacin (Vitamin B3)
### Generic Name
Niacin (Vitamin B3)

### Usage
Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid or vitamin B3, is primarily used to treat dyslipidemias, specifically Fredrickson types IIa and IIb (primary hypercholesterolemia).  It's effective as both monotherapy and adjunctive therapy, meaning it can be used alone or with other medications.  A key application is minimizing the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (heart attack) in patients with a history of heart attack and hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood).  Niacin also helps delay the progression or even promote the regression of coronary artery disease. In addition, it's used as adjunctive therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia (very high triglyceride levels) in adults at risk of pancreatitis.  Finally, it's widely used as a dietary supplement.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Regular-release and extended-release formulations of niacin are *not* interchangeable.  Dosages vary significantly depending on the formulation and the reason for taking it.

**Adults:**

* **Dyslipidemia:** Dosages are highly individualized and titrated up slowly to find the most effective dose with tolerable side effects.  This usually involves starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it over several weeks or months.  Specific starting doses and maximum daily doses vary widely depending on the formulation (immediate-release, sustained-release, extended-release).  A physician will carefully determine the appropriate regimen.  
    * Regular-release:  May start at 250 mg once daily, gradually increasing to a maximum of 6 grams daily in divided doses.
    * Sustained-release:  Usual dose is 250-750 mg once daily.
    * Extended-release:  May start at 500 mg at bedtime, increasing to a maximum of 2 grams daily.


* **Dietary Supplement:** The recommended daily allowance varies by age and sex but is typically much lower than the doses used to treat dyslipidemia.  Commonly, 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily.


* **Pellagra (off-label use):**  This is a rare condition caused by niacin deficiency.  Dosages are much lower than those used for lipid management, typically 50-100 mg three or four times daily, not exceeding 500 mg daily.

**Children:**

Pediatric use of niacin for dyslipidemia is uncommon and typically not the first-line treatment.  Dosages for dyslipidemia in children (aged 10 and older) are carefully determined by a physician and are based on weight, starting low and increasing gradually as tolerated.  For pellagra, the dosage is also lower than that used in adults.  Precise dosing will be determined by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Flushing (redness of the skin)
* Itching
* Headache
* Upset stomach (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Liver damage (hepatitis, jaundice)
* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
* Gout
* Irregular heartbeat
* Vision changes


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Niacin is converted into nicotinamide, which then forms nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form NADH. These are crucial coenzymes involved in numerous metabolic processes, including lipid metabolism.  While the exact mechanism of niacin's lipid-lowering effects isn't fully understood, it's thought to involve reducing the release of free fatty acids from fat tissue and increasing lipoprotein lipase activity, leading to improved removal of triglycerides from the blood.  This results in decreased levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a), and increased levels of HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Niacin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to niacin or any formulation component, active liver disease, significant or unexplained elevations in liver enzymes, active peptic ulcers, or arterial hemorrhage.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.  Concurrent use with cholestyramine or colestipol reduces niacin's bioavailability.  Concomitant use with aspirin may decrease niacin's clearance.  Niacin can potentiate the effects of ganglionic blocking agents and vasoactive drugs.
* **Warnings:**  Niacin can cause flushing and itching, especially at higher doses.  It may aggravate peptic ulcers or cause gastrointestinal distress.  There's a risk of liver damage, especially at high doses.  Patients with diabetes, gout, or bleeding disorders need careful monitoring.  Use caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding, as niacin crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take niacin without a doctor's prescription?**  A: While niacin is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement, doses used for treating dyslipidemia are significantly higher and require medical supervision due to the increased risk of side effects.
* **Q: How do I minimize flushing?** A: Taking niacin with food or milk can help.  Lower doses, slow titration, and taking the medication at bedtime can also reduce flushing.  Your doctor might prescribe aspirin or another NSAID to prevent flushing.
* **Q: How should I store niacin?** A: Store niacin in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see improvements in lipid levels varies depending on the dose and individual response.  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor progress.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose to catch up.
