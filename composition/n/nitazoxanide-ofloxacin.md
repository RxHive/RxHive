# Nitazoxanide + Ofloxacin
### Generic Name
Nitazoxanide + Ofloxacin  (Combination)

**Note:**  Nitazoxanide and Ofloxacin are often used in combination, particularly in certain parts of the world, but this is not a universally approved or standardized fixed-dose combination.  Prescribing information will vary depending on the specific formulation and country of origin. This information provides general guidance based on the individual properties of each drug.  Always refer to the prescribing information provided with your specific medication.


### Usage

This combination medication typically targets infections caused by both bacteria and parasites.  

* **Nitazoxanide:** Primarily acts as an antiparasitic agent. It's effective against various intestinal parasites, including *Giardia lamblia*, *Cryptosporidium parvum*, and *Entamoeba histolytica*. It may also show activity against some viruses, although this is less established.

* **Ofloxacin:**  This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, effective against a broad range of bacteria.  It's often used to treat bacterial infections in various parts of the body, including the respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin.


The combination is frequently used to treat diarrheal illnesses where both bacterial and parasitic causes are suspected or confirmed.  The exact indications might vary according to regional practices and physician judgment.


### Dosage

**Dosage information for Nitazoxanide + Ofloxacin combination products is not standardized.**  The dosage of each component will vary greatly depending on the specific formulation, the age and weight of the patient, the severity of the infection, and the prescribing physician's judgment.  There is no single "standard" dosage to provide here.  **Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or the medication packaging.**

**Individual Drug Dosages (Illustrative - NOT a prescription):**

* **Nitazoxanide:**  Dosage is typically weight-based for oral administration, usually ranging from 10-20 mg/kg/day divided into two or three doses. Specific dosages for children and adults vary.  There are no IV formulations of nitazoxanide.

* **Ofloxacin:** Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Oral and intravenous formulations exist, with dosages often ranging from 200mg to 800mg daily for adults, divided into doses.  Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and weight-based.

### How it Works

* **Nitazoxanide:** The precise mechanism isn't completely understood, but it's believed to interfere with the energy production pathways of parasites, leading to their death.

* **Ofloxacin:**  Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This action prevents bacterial growth and leads to bacterial cell death.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of both Nitazoxanide and Ofloxacin during pregnancy and breastfeeding needs careful consideration by a healthcare professional, as they may pose risks to the fetus or infant.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ofloxacin can interact with other medications, including anticoagulants, theophylline, and some antacids. Nitazoxanide interactions are less documented. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with a history of allergies to quinolones (like Ofloxacin) or nitazoxanide should exercise extreme caution and inform their doctor.

* **Liver or Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function for both drugs.

* **Children:**  Pediatric use of both drugs requires careful attention to appropriate dosing and potential risks.
