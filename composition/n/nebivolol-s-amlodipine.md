# Nebivolol + S-Amlodipine

**Generic Name:** Nebivolol and Amlodipine Besylate (Note:  "S-Amlodipine" refers to the active isomer of amlodipine.  Generic formulations usually list Amlodipine Besylate.)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It combines a beta-blocker (nebivolol) and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine).  This combination is often prescribed when a single medication is not effective enough to control blood pressure.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual, but common ones include:

* **Nebivolol-related:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, slow heart rate (bradycardia), shortness of breath, cold extremities, sleep disturbances.  Rarely, more serious side effects such as worsening heart failure or bronchospasm (in individuals with asthma or COPD) can occur.
* **Amlodipine-related:** Headache, dizziness, swelling in the ankles or feet (peripheral edema), flushing, fatigue, nausea.  Rarely, more serious side effects such as liver problems, low blood pressure (hypotension), and heart problems can occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Nebivolol:**  Works by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on the heart and blood vessels. This leads to a decrease in heart rate and blood vessel constriction, lowering blood pressure.  It also has some vasodilating properties.
* **Amlodipine:** Relaxes blood vessels by blocking the entry of calcium ions into the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel walls. This causes the blood vessels to widen, reducing resistance to blood flow and lowering blood pressure.

The combination of nebivolol and amlodipine provides a synergistic effect, meaning that the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.  This allows for better blood pressure control.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can potentially lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects like dizziness.
* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure or other complications.  Your doctor should help you gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue treatment.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **What are the precautions?** Inform your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions, such as heart problems, liver or kidney disease, asthma, or diabetes.  This medication should be used with caution in elderly patients and those with impaired liver or kidney function.
* **Can I take this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  This should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding under the strict supervision of a doctor. The risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed.
* **What are the potential drug interactions?** Many medications can interact with nebivolol and amlodipine.  Be sure to inform your doctor about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.
