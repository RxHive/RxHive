# Norepinephrine

**Generic Name:** Norepinephrine (also known as Noradrenaline)

**Usage:**

Norepinephrine is used primarily in medical emergencies to treat:

* **Hypotensive shock:**  Specifically, septic shock, neurogenic shock, and cardiogenic shock (though other treatments are usually preferred for the last).  It raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels.
* **Cardiac arrest:** In conjunction with other resuscitation efforts. It helps increase heart rate and contractility.


It is administered intravenously (IV) in these situations, usually under close medical supervision.  It's *not* used for chronic conditions or everyday blood pressure management.

**Side Effects:**

Norepinephrine has a significant number of potential side effects, many due to its potent vasoconstricting properties:

* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):** Can lead to arrhythmias.
* **Increased blood pressure (hypertension):** Can be severe and potentially dangerous, especially in patients with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Headache:** A common side effect.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Relatively common.
* **Chest pain (angina):** Can worsen existing angina.
* **Tissue necrosis (localized death of tissue):**  Due to vasoconstriction if the drug extravasates (leaks out of the vein).
* **Peripheral ischemia:** Reduced blood flow to the extremities, causing coldness and discoloration.
* **Anxiety:**  A common response to the drug's effects and the stressful situation it is used to treat.
* **Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs):** In some cases.


**How it Works:**

Norepinephrine is a naturally occurring catecholamine and a neurotransmitter. It acts primarily on alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptors.  This action leads to:

* **Vasoconstriction:**  Contraction of blood vessels, increasing peripheral resistance and raising blood pressure.  This is primarily mediated by alpha-1 receptors.
* **Increased heart rate and contractility:**  Increasing cardiac output and boosting blood pressure.  This is primarily mediated by beta-1 receptors.


The net effect is an increase in blood pressure and improved perfusion (blood flow) to vital organs in critically ill patients.

**FAQs:**

* **Is norepinephrine the same as epinephrine (adrenaline)?** No, while both are catecholamines and affect similar systems, they have different receptor affinities and effects. Epinephrine has a broader effect on alpha and beta receptors, leading to more significant effects on the heart and bronchodilation.
* **Can I take norepinephrine orally?** No, norepinephrine is rapidly metabolized and is ineffective when taken orally. It must be administered intravenously.
* **Is norepinephrine safe for long-term use?** No, it is only used in emergency situations due to the significant risks of side effects with prolonged administration.
* **What are the risks of extravasation?** Extravasation, where the drug leaks out of the vein, can cause severe tissue damage due to the potent vasoconstriction. Immediate intervention is required if this occurs.
* **Who should not receive norepinephrine?** Patients with certain cardiovascular conditions (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, severe coronary artery disease), pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland), and those with hypersensitivity to the drug should avoid its use.
