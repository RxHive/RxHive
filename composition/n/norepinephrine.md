# Norepinephrine
### Generic Name
Norepinephrine (Noradrenaline)

### Usage

Norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and inotropic agent primarily used in emergency situations to treat severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and various forms of shock.  These include:

* **Cardiogenic shock:**  Shock caused by the heart's inability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
* **Septic shock:**  A life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming infection. Norepinephrine is used as an adjunct therapy in septic shock, meaning it's used alongside other treatments.
* **Hypovolemic shock:** Though technically contraindicated unless used temporarily to maintain vital organ perfusion until fluid replacement can occur, norepinephrine can be briefly employed if blood volume needs to be urgently improved.
* **Post-cardiac arrest shock:**  Shock that occurs after a cardiac arrest.


Norepinephrine's effects on blood pressure and heart function make it a critical medication in these life-threatening situations.  It's important to note that norepinephrine is not a first-line treatment for these conditions; addressing the underlying cause is crucial.  Fluid resuscitation (giving fluids intravenously) is typically attempted first. Norepinephrine is reserved for situations where the shock persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

### Dosage

Norepinephrine dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's condition, response to treatment, and other medications they may be taking.  It's always administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion using an infusion pump for precise control.  The medication needs dilution before administration.  Central line administration is preferred to avoid extravasation (leakage into surrounding tissue). If a central line is unavailable, a large proximal vein may be used temporarily.

**Adult Dosage (IV infusion):**

Dosage is usually determined either by weight or non-weight-based methods.  The most common method is by starting with a low dose, which is carefully increased until the desired blood pressure is achieved.  

* **Non-weight-based:** Initial dose of 8-12 mcg/min, titrated up or down in 2-4 mcg/min increments to achieve the desired blood pressure.  
* **Weight-based:** Initial dose of 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min, then adjusted to 0.02-1 mcg/kg/min as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage (IV infusion):**

The safety and effectiveness of norepinephrine in children haven't been fully established. Use in pediatrics is carefully monitored, and dosage is based on weight:

* **Hypotension/shock:** Initial dose: 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min; maximum dose: 1-2 mcg/kg/min
* **Cardiac output maintenance:** Initial dose: 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min; maintenance dose: 0.1-0.2 mcg/kg/min


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Specific adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not routinely recommended in manufacturer's guidelines, but close monitoring is necessary.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Anxiety
* Transient high blood pressure (hypertension)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Peripheral vascular insufficiency (reduced blood flow to the extremities)
* Peripheral ischemia or gangrene (tissue damage due to lack of blood flow)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as less common, immediate medical attention should be sought.

### How it Works

Norepinephrine acts on alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the body.  

* **Alpha-1 receptor activation** causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), increasing peripheral resistance, and thus raising blood pressure.
* **Beta-1 receptor activation** increases heart rate and contractility (the force of heart contractions), boosting cardiac output (the amount of blood the heart pumps).

By these mechanisms, norepinephrine raises blood pressure and improves blood flow to vital organs, combating the effects of shock.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Norepinephrine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it, severe hypovolemia (except for temporary use), mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis (except in critical situations), and when used concurrently with certain anesthetic agents (cyclopropane or halothane).
* **Drug Interactions:** Norepinephrine can interact significantly with numerous medications, including alpha-blockers, amphetamines, anesthetics, antacids, anti-arrhythmics, anti-diabetic drugs, anti-hypertensives, MAO inhibitors, and many others.  The interactions can either reduce norepinephrine's effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects. Close monitoring and potential dosage adjustments are necessary when using norepinephrine with other medications.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Patients with known hypersensitivity to sulfites should be carefully monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Norepinephrine is categorized as pregnancy category C; its effects on the fetus are not fully understood. Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered.  Excretion into breast milk is unknown, so caution is warranted during breastfeeding.
* **Extravasation:**  A very serious risk with norepinephrine. Extravasation can lead to severe tissue damage. Careful monitoring of the IV site is crucial. Immediate action is needed if extravasation occurs. (See general considerations below).
* **Abrupt Withdrawal:** Abrupt discontinuation of norepinephrine can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure.  The infusion rate should be gradually reduced while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is norepinephrine stored?** A:  Storage requirements vary depending on the specific formulation; always follow the manufacturer's instructions.  Generally, it should be protected from light and stored at controlled room temperature.
* **Q: How long does it take for norepinephrine to work?** A: The effects are typically seen quite quickly, within minutes of starting the infusion.
* **Q: Can norepinephrine be given orally?** A: No, norepinephrine is only administered intravenously.
* **Q: What happens if I miss a dose?** A: Norepinephrine is given as a continuous infusion, not as individual doses. It's crucial to maintain a continuous infusion as prescribed.  If there is a disruption, consult a healthcare provider immediately.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of norepinephrine?** A: Norepinephrine is generally used for short periods during critical situations. Long-term use is uncommon, and the potential long-term effects are not well documented.


**General Considerations:**

* **IV Administration:** Administer as a continuous infusion via an infusion pump. Dilute prior to use.
* **Extravasation Management:** If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion immediately, aspirate extravasated fluid, remove the catheter, elevate the extremity, and administer a phentolamine injection (or other approved antidote) into the affected area as soon as possible, followed by warm compresses.
* **Hypovolemia:** Address hypovolemia before starting norepinephrine therapy.  Adequate fluid resuscitation is essential.
* **Blood Pressure Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is crucial to avoid dangerously high blood pressure.
