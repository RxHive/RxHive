# Nimesulide + Levocetirizine

**Generic Name:** Nimesulide + Levocetirizine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to provide relief from symptoms associated with allergic reactions and pain, particularly those involving inflammation.  Common uses include:

* **Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever):**  Relieves symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and itching.
* **Urticaria (Hives):**  Reduces itching and inflammation associated with hives.
* **Pain Relief:**  Provides relief from mild to moderate pain, such as headache, muscle aches, and toothache, often associated with allergic reactions.  It's *not* typically used for severe pain.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, and the severity can depend on the dosage and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects may include:

* **Nimesulide related:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach upset, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache.  Rare but serious side effects include liver damage (hepatotoxicity), allergic reactions (skin rash, swelling), and increased risk of bleeding.
* **Levocetirizine related:**  Drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, dizziness.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.

**It's crucial to note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Nimesulide:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.
* **Levocetirizine:** This is an antihistamine. It blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions.  Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with allergies.  By blocking histamine, levocetirizine helps relieve itching, sneezing, runny nose, and other allergic symptoms.

The combination works synergistically; Nimesulide addresses the pain and inflammation component, while Levocetirizine targets the allergic symptoms.
