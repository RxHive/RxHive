# Nimesulide + Levocetirizine
### Generic Name
Nimesulide + Levocetirizine

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used to provide relief from symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and the common cold.  It combines the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of nimesulide with the antihistamine properties of levocetirizine.

Nimesulide acts as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to reduce pain and inflammation, particularly helpful in managing symptoms like headache, muscle aches, and sinus pain often accompanying colds and allergies. Levocetirizine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  This helps to alleviate symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion.  While this combination is primarily used for upper respiratory symptoms, it's crucial to understand that it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the allergy or infection; it only manages the symptoms.

### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of their symptoms.  There is no standardized, universally approved dosage for this combination as it's usually prescribed as a compounded medication tailored to the patient's specific needs.  Therefore, the following information is for general illustrative purposes and should *not* replace a doctor's prescription.

**Oral Dosage (typically tablet or capsule form):**  The dosages for both nimesulide and levocetirizine would be prescribed separately by a physician within the approved ranges for each individual component. The specific combination and frequency would be tailored to the patient.

**For Adults:**  A typical dosage might involve 100mg of nimesulide and 5mg of levocetirizine, usually taken once or twice daily.

**For Children:** The use of this combination in children is generally not recommended without specific guidance from a pediatrician, as appropriate dosages for nimesulide and levocetirizine in children need careful consideration due to their developmental stages.

**IV Dosage:** This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously.  Nimesulide and levocetirizine are usually given orally.

**Important Note:** Never adjust the dosage on your own. Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage regimen.

### How it Works

Nimesulide inhibits the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory chemicals responsible for pain and swelling.  By reducing prostaglandin levels, nimesulide alleviates pain and inflammation. Levocetirizine is a selective antagonist of peripheral H1-receptors. Histamine, when released during an allergic reaction, binds to these receptors triggering symptoms like sneezing and itching.  Levocetirizine blocks histamine from binding, thus preventing these symptoms.  The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic actions, addressing multiple symptoms of allergic rhinitis and the common cold.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with known allergies to nimesulide, levocetirizine, or any of the inactive ingredients.  Individuals with a history of peptic ulcers, bleeding disorders, or severe liver or kidney problems should avoid this medication.  It's also generally contraindicated in pregnant women, especially during the third trimester, breastfeeding mothers, and children unless prescribed by a pediatrician.

* **Drug Interactions:** Nimesulide can interact with anticoagulants (blood thinners), aspirin, and other NSAIDs, increasing the risk of bleeding.  It may also interact with certain medications used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetes. Levocetirizine can interact with other sedatives or central nervous system depressants, increasing drowsiness. Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Warnings:**  Elderly patients and those with pre-existing liver or kidney disease require careful monitoring when taking this medication due to increased risk of adverse effects.  Alcohol consumption should be minimized while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of stomach upset and other adverse effects.
