# Naproxen

**Generic Name:** Naproxen

**Usage:** Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce fever and relieve mild to moderate pain and inflammation.  It's commonly used for:

* **Pain relief:** Headaches, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, back pain, toothaches, and other types of pain.
* **Fever reduction:**  To lower a fever associated with the common cold, flu, or other illnesses.
* **Inflammation reduction:** To reduce inflammation in conditions like arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile arthritis), tendinitis, bursitis, and gout.


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, naproxen can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, gas.  More serious gastrointestinal issues like ulcers, bleeding, or perforation are possible, though less common.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure, especially with long-term use or high doses.
* **Renal:**  Fluid retention, kidney problems.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a rare but serious reaction).
* **Other:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, ringing in the ears (tinnitus).


**How it Works:** Naproxen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation. By reducing prostaglandin production, naproxen helps to alleviate these symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **Is naproxen a blood thinner?**  While not as strong a blood thinner as warfarin or heparin, naproxen can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in combination with other blood thinners or if you have a bleeding disorder.
* **Can I take naproxen with alcohol?** Combining naproxen with alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects.  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking naproxen.
* **Can I take naproxen with other medications?**  Naproxen can interact with many other medications, including blood thinners, diuretics, and some antidepressants. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting naproxen.
* **How long can I take naproxen?** The length of time you can take naproxen depends on your condition and your doctor's recommendations.  Long-term use should be carefully monitored due to the risk of side effects.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **What are the symptoms of a naproxen overdose?** Symptoms of an overdose can include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, dizziness, and ringing in the ears.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose.
