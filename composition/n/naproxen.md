# Naproxen
### Generic Name
Naproxen

### Usage
Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat a variety of conditions involving pain and inflammation.  Its primary uses include relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It's also effective in managing acute gout flares, bursitis, and tendonitis.  Naproxen is frequently used for the relief of mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea), and other types of musculoskeletal pain.  While not officially approved for all these conditions in every country, it is commonly used off-label for migraine prevention and acute migraine treatment.


### Dosage
Naproxen dosages vary considerably depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation (immediate-release, extended-release, or suppository).  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.  Information provided below is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice.


**Adult Dosage:**  Dosages are usually expressed in terms of naproxen base; note that naproxen sodium contains a slightly higher amount of the active ingredient.

* **Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis:** Typically 500-1000 mg daily divided into two doses. Higher doses (up to 1500 mg/day) may be used for a limited time under strict medical supervision.  Extended-release formulations offer once-daily dosing options.
* **Acute Gout Flares:**  Usually starts with a higher initial dose (750 mg) followed by smaller doses every 8 hours.
* **Mild to Moderate Pain, Dysmenorrhea:**  Often begins with 500 mg, followed by 250-500 mg every 6-12 hours, as needed. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 1000 mg (except possibly on the first day).
* **Migraine (off-label):**  Dosage varies depending on whether it's for prevention or acute treatment.  Prevention typically involves lower doses (250-500 mg twice daily), while acute treatment might necessitate a higher initial dose.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage in children depends greatly on the child's weight and the specific condition.  It is crucial to follow the physician's instructions closely, as incorrect dosing can be harmful.  Immediate-release formulations are generally preferred for children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage modifications might be necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  Those with severe renal impairment should generally avoid naproxen.  Always consult a healthcare professional before adjusting the dosage.

### How it Works
Naproxen works by inhibiting the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, which are responsible for producing prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, naproxen alleviates these symptoms.  While the primary mechanism is COX inhibition, other potential mechanisms involving immune cells may also play a role.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Naproxen should be avoided by individuals with a history of allergies to NSAIDs, aspirin, or any of its components.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Naproxen can increase the risk of stomach ulcers, bleeding, and perforation. Use with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal problems.  Taking it with food or milk may help reduce these risks.
* **Cardiovascular Risk:**  Naproxen may increase the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke, especially with long-term use or in individuals with existing heart conditions.
* **Renal Function:**  Use caution in patients with kidney problems; naproxen may impair kidney function further.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Naproxen is generally avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy and while breastfeeding.  Use during the second trimester should only be considered after consulting a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Naproxen can interact with many other medications, including blood thinners, diuretics, and other NSAIDs.  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly individuals are at higher risk for adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take naproxen with alcohol?**  A: Combining naproxen with alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other adverse effects.  It is best to avoid alcohol while taking naproxen.
* **Q: How should I store naproxen?** A: Store naproxen in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.
* **Q: Can I stop taking naproxen suddenly?**  A: It's generally best to taper off naproxen under your doctor's supervision, rather than stopping suddenly.
