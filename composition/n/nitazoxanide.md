# Nitazoxanide
### Generic Name
Nitazoxanide

### Usage
Nitazoxanide is an antiparasitic medication primarily used to treat diarrhea caused by the parasites *Giardia lamblia* (giardiasis) and *Cryptosporidium parvum* (cryptosporidiosis).  While its primary use is in treating these intestinal infections,  it's also sometimes used off-label for other conditions. These off-label uses include treating *Clostridioides difficile* infection (commonly known as *C. difficile* colitis) and cryptosporidiosis-associated diarrhea in HIV-infected patients (though this requires careful management and often involves additional therapies).  It's important to note that off-label use should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The standard adult dose for giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis is 500 mg orally every 12 hours for three days. For *C. difficile* infection (off-label), the dose may be extended to 500 mg every 12 hours for 7-10 days.  For cryptosporidiosis in HIV-positive individuals (off-label), dosages of 500-1000 mg twice daily for 14 days may be used, but this must be combined with other treatments such as optimized antiretroviral therapy, electrolyte replacement, and supportive care for rehydration.


**Children:**  Dosage for children varies significantly based on age and the specific infection being treated.  Always follow the healthcare provider's instructions and use the appropriate formulation (e.g., suspension or tablets). Generally, lower dosages are used for younger children.  Specific pediatric dosing information is required from a healthcare provider and will consider the child’s weight and condition.  The provided text offers examples, but these are NOT substitutes for a physician's specific instructions.

**Forms:** Nitazoxanide is available in both tablet and oral suspension forms.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Discoloration of urine

Less common, but more serious side effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients) may include:

* Worsening diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Skin rash
* Hives (urticaria)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Nitazoxanide works by interfering with the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for the energy metabolism of certain anaerobic parasites. By inhibiting PFOR, nitazoxanide disrupts the parasite's ability to produce energy, ultimately leading to its death and resolution of the infection.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Nitazoxanide should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to the medication or any of its components.
* **Immunocompromised patients:** Use caution in patients with weakened immune systems, as their response to treatment might be less effective.
* **Neonates:**  Formulations containing benzyl alcohol should be avoided in neonates due to the risk of gasping syndrome.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nitazoxanide may interact with other drugs, particularly those that are highly protein-bound, like warfarin.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While nitazoxanide is categorized as pregnancy category B (meaning it has not shown risk in animal studies, but human data is limited), its use during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor.  The active metabolite of nitazoxanide is present in breast milk.  The decision to breastfeed while on this medication needs to balance the benefit to the mother against the potential risk to the infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Nitazoxanide with food?** A: Yes, it's recommended to take Nitazoxanide with food.
* **Q: How should I store Nitazoxanide?** A: Store Nitazoxanide as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Is Nitazoxanide safe for long-term use?** A:  Nitazoxanide is generally not intended for long-term use. The duration of treatment is typically short, as determined by the healthcare provider based on the individual's condition and response to therapy.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it’s nearly time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking Nitazoxanide if my symptoms improve?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if your symptoms improve before the medication is finished. This helps prevent recurrence of the infection.
