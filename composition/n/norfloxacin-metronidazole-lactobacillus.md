# Norfloxacin + Metronidazole + Lactobacillus
### Generic Name
Norfloxacin + Metronidazole + Lactobacillus


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly those involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against a wide range of aerobic bacteria, while metronidazole targets anaerobic bacteria. Lactobacillus is added as a probiotic to help restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which can be disrupted by the antibiotics.  This combination is often prescribed for infections like:

* **Infectious diarrhea:**  Caused by a mixture of bacteria.
* **Gastroenteritis:** Inflammation of the stomach and intestines often accompanied by diarrhea and vomiting.
* **Infections following colorectal surgery:** Preventing post-operative infections.


It's crucial to understand that this combination is not suitable for all types of gastrointestinal infections.  A doctor will determine if this is the appropriate treatment based on the specific bacteria identified and the patient's overall health.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation, the age and weight of the patient, the severity of the infection, and the prescribing physician's judgment.  There is no standardized, universally applicable dosage. **It's vital to follow the instructions on your prescription label precisely.**  There are several possible delivery methods:

* **Oral Tablets/Capsules:**  The dosage will typically be in the form of tablets or capsules that should be taken with food.  The specific numbers of tablets/capsules and the frequency will vary per prescription.
* **Oral Suspension (Syrup):**  A liquid form is available for children and patients who have difficulty swallowing pills. Again, the specific dose and frequency will be indicated on your prescription.

**There are no standard IV formulations of this combined medication.**  Intravenous administration of the individual components (Norfloxacin and Metronidazole) may be used in severe cases of infection but only under direct medical supervision in a hospital setting.  Lactobacillus is not typically administered intravenously.

**Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for the correct dosage and administration instructions.** Self-adjusting dosage can be dangerous.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Changes in taste
* Allergic skin reactions (rash, itching)

Less common, but more serious side effects, require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Tendonitis or tendon rupture (especially with Norfloxacin)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) â€“ a serious intestinal infection
* Liver damage (with Metronidazole)
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

This combination medication works through the combined action of its components:

* **Norfloxacin:** This antibiotic inhibits DNA replication and repair in susceptible bacteria, ultimately killing them.  It's effective against a broad spectrum of aerobic (oxygen-requiring) gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.

* **Metronidazole:** This antibiotic disrupts the DNA of anaerobic (non-oxygen-requiring) bacteria, leading to their death. It's particularly effective against many anaerobic bacteria commonly found in the gut.

* **Lactobacillus:** This probiotic is a type of beneficial bacteria that helps restore the normal gut flora. The antibiotics can kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria; Lactobacillus helps replenish the good bacteria, reducing the risk of side effects like diarrhea and promoting gut health.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a physician, weighing the risks and benefits.

* **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor about any allergies to antibiotics, particularly fluoroquinolones or nitroimidazoles.

* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.

* **Children:**  Use in children should be based on the doctor's assessment and is not recommended for very young children.

* **Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), antacids, and certain medications metabolized by the liver.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Photosensitivity:**  Avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet (UV) light while taking this medication, especially Norfloxacin, which increases sensitivity to sunlight.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with alcohol?** A: No. Alcohol can interact with metronidazole, potentially causing severe side effects. Avoid alcohol during treatment.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How long does treatment usually last?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the infection's severity and response to the medication. Your doctor will determine the appropriate course of treatment.

* **Q: Can I stop taking the medication early if I feel better?** A: No.  Completing the full course of antibiotics is crucial to ensure the infection is completely eradicated.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence or antibiotic resistance.
