# Nicardipine
### Generic Name
Nicardipine

### Usage
Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker primarily used to manage two significant cardiovascular conditions: chronic stable angina and hypertension (high blood pressure).  Its primary action is to relax blood vessels, improving blood flow to the heart (in angina) and lowering blood pressure throughout the body.  While its primary use is in these chronic conditions, nicardipine also has off-label uses in managing acute hypertension (including hypertensive emergencies) and in specific situations during and after stroke treatment.  These off-label uses often involve intravenous administration for rapid blood pressure control.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (oral or intravenous), and the patient's individual response.  Always follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  Information below is for general understanding only and should not be considered a substitute for personalized medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension (Oral):**  The typical starting dose is 20-40 mg of the immediate-release formulation every 8 hours, or 30-60 mg of the extended-release formulation every 12 hours.  The extended-release form is generally preferred for its convenience and smoother blood pressure control.  The dose is adjusted based on blood pressure response.
* **Hypertension (Intravenous):** For those unable to take oral medication, intravenous nicardipine is initiated at a rate of 5 mg/hour.  This rate can be carefully increased in increments of 2.5 mg/hour every 5-15 minutes, as directed by a healthcare professional, up to a maximum of 15 mg/hour.  The infusion rate is adjusted according to the patient's blood pressure response.
* **Chronic Stable Angina (Oral):**  Treatment starts at 20 mg three times daily, increasing gradually over several days to reach a total daily dose of 60-120 mg.
* **Acute Hypertension, Stroke, and other critical situations (Intravenous):** The dosage and titration strategy are highly individualized and require close monitoring by a healthcare professional.  The starting dose is typically 5 mg/hour, with adjustments in 2.5 mg/hour increments.

**Children:**

Intravenous nicardipine is sometimes used off-label in children with severe hypertension. Dosage is highly individualized based on weight and blood pressure and requires careful monitoring by a physician.  Specific dosing should always be determined by a pediatrician or pediatric cardiologist.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.  Always consult a physician for appropriate adjustments based on your health status.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Swelling in the ankles or feet (edema)
* Nausea
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Chest pain
* Liver problems
* Severe low blood pressure
* Allergic reactions

If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Nicardipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.  Calcium ions play a key role in the contraction of heart muscle and blood vessel walls. Nicardipine works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into these cells, causing relaxation of both the heart muscle and blood vessels. This leads to decreased heart rate, reduced blood pressure, and improved blood flow, particularly to the heart muscle in angina patients.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Nicardipine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug and those with severe aortic stenosis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nicardipine can interact with other medications, particularly beta-blockers, cimetidine, and cyclosporine. Consult a doctor about any other medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nicardipine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its safety has not been fully established. It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should avoid it.
* **Other Precautions:** Nicardipine should be used cautiously in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Abrupt withdrawal can lead to rebound angina in patients with coronary artery disease.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take nicardipine with grapefruit juice?** A: No, grapefruit juice can interact with nicardipine and increase its levels in your body, potentially causing adverse effects.  Avoid consuming grapefruit juice while taking this medication.

* **Q: How should I store nicardipine?** A: Store nicardipine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking nicardipine suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping nicardipine, especially if you have coronary artery disease, can lead to a rebound effect and worsen angina.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing the dosage of your medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is nicardipine addictive?** A: Nicardipine is not considered an addictive medication.
