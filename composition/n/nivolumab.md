# Nivolumab
### Generic Name
Nivolumab

### Usage
Nivolumab is a type of immunotherapy drug, specifically a PD-1 inhibitor.  It works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which is found on certain immune cells (T cells).  Cancer cells often use PD-1 to evade detection and destruction by the immune system. By blocking PD-1, Nivolumab helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively.

Nivolumab is used to treat various types of cancers, either as a single agent or in combination with other therapies.  Its primary use is in treating advanced or metastatic cancers that have not responded well to other treatments, or have recurred after previous therapies.  Specific cancers it is used to treat include:

* **Melanoma:**  Both unresectable (cannot be surgically removed) and metastatic (spread to other parts of the body) melanoma.
* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):** Metastatic or recurrent NSCLC, sometimes used as a first-line treatment in combination with other therapies.
* **Renal cell carcinoma (RCC):** Advanced RCC, sometimes as a first-line treatment in combination with other therapies.
* **Urothelial carcinoma:** Locally advanced or metastatic, as well as adjuvant treatment (after surgery) to reduce the risk of recurrence.
* **Colorectal cancer:** Metastatic colorectal cancer with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) characteristics.
* **Esophageal cancer:**  Including esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and gastroesophageal junction cancer; used both for advanced disease and as adjuvant therapy after surgery.
* **Gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction cancer:** Advanced or metastatic disease.
* **Squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck:** Recurrent or metastatic disease.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma:** In combination with ipilimumab.
* **Classical Hodgkin lymphoma:** In patients whose disease has progressed after other treatments.
* **Malignant pleural mesothelioma:** Unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma, often as a first-line treatment in combination with ipilimumab.


### Dosage

Nivolumab is administered intravenously (IV) as an infusion. The dosage varies greatly depending on the specific cancer being treated, whether it's used alone or in combination with other drugs, and the patient's weight.  It is crucial to follow the healthcare provider's precise instructions.  Examples of dosing regimens include:

* **Single agent:** 240 mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks.
* **Combination therapy (with ipilimumab):**  Dosage regimens vary significantly depending on the specific cancer, often involving a combination of initial doses followed by maintenance therapy. Dosages may be based on body weight (mg/kg) or a fixed dose (mg).


**Pediatric Dosage:** Nivolumab is used in pediatric patients (age ≥12 years) with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer.  Dosage is determined by weight and age, typically 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 240 mg/480 mg based on weight. Consult a specialist for precise guidelines.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function, and the occurrence of side effects.  These adjustments are determined by the healthcare provider, typically reducing the dosage or temporarily halting treatment if side effects are severe.

### Side Effects

Nivolumab can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.  It's important to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Rash
* Cough
* Shortness of breath
* Headache
* Muscle aches

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  These can include:

* **Immune-related adverse events:**  These are a significant concern with Nivolumab and can affect various organs.  Examples include pneumonitis (lung inflammation), colitis (inflammation of the colon), hepatitis (liver inflammation), nephritis (kidney inflammation), endocrinopathies (hormonal imbalances), and skin reactions (severe rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).  These serious side effects usually require immediate medical attention and may necessitate stopping Nivolumab treatment.
* **Infusion reactions:** Allergic-type reactions during the IV infusion.
* **Cardiovascular effects:**  Including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and hypertension (high blood pressure).
* **Neurological effects:**  Including encephalitis (brain inflammation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and neuropathy (nerve damage).

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your physician for a complete list of potential side effects and for advice on managing any adverse effects.


### How it Works

Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 protein found on the surface of T cells, a type of immune cell crucial for fighting infections and cancer.  Cancer cells often produce proteins like PD-L1 that bind to PD-1, effectively putting the brakes on the T cells and preventing them from attacking the cancer. Nivolumab blocks the PD-1 receptor, thus releasing the T cells and allowing them to resume their attack on the cancer cells. This is often referred to as immune checkpoint inhibition.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Nivolumab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:**  Nivolumab is not recommended for use during pregnancy due to the potential risk to the fetus.  Women should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 5 months after the last dose. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for 5 months afterward.
* **Immune-related adverse events:** Patients should be closely monitored for immune-related adverse effects.  Early detection and appropriate management are essential to minimize the risk of serious complications.
* **Other medications:**  Interactions with other medications are possible.  It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies currently being taken.
* **Infusion reactions:** Patients should be closely monitored during and after the infusion for any signs of infusion-related reactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Nivolumab to work?**  A: The response time to Nivolumab varies greatly depending on the individual, the type of cancer, and the stage of the disease.  Some patients may see improvement within a few weeks, while others may take longer.  Regular monitoring is needed to assess treatment response.

* **Q: How is Nivolumab stored?** A:  Storage instructions are provided by the manufacturer and should be followed precisely.  Generally, Nivolumab is stored refrigerated.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a scheduled dose to discuss the next steps. Do not try to adjust the dose yourself.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Nivolumab?** A:  Alcohol consumption may interact with certain side effects (such as fatigue) associated with Nivolumab. Consult your healthcare provider regarding alcohol consumption during treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects, no matter how minor, to your healthcare provider immediately. Some side effects may require medical attention or dosage adjustments.
