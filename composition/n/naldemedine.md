# Naldemedine
### Generic Name
Naldemedine

### Usage
Naldemedine is primarily used to treat opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults experiencing chronic non-cancer pain.  This includes individuals with chronic pain stemming from previous cancer or its treatment who don't need frequent increases in their opioid dosage (e.g., weekly or more often).  It's specifically designed to address constipation caused by opioid medications, not constipation from other sources.

### Dosage
**Opioid-induced constipation (Adults):** The standard oral dose is 0.2 mg once daily.  Treatment should be stopped if the opioid pain medication is discontinued.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of naldemedine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B). However, naldemedine should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) as its safety and efficacy haven't been established in this population.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary, but use should be avoided.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (Frequency not precisely defined but reported):**

* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Gastroenteritis

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Post-marketing reports and/or case studies):**

* Hypersensitivity reactions

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Naldemedine is an opioid antagonist. It works by blocking the effects of opioids in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  Specifically, it antagonizes mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors, primarily focusing on mu-opioid receptors.  By blocking these receptors, it counteracts the opioid-induced slowing of bowel movements, thereby relieving constipation.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Known hypersensitivity to naldemedine or any component of the formulation.
* Gastrointestinal obstruction (known or suspected) or increased risk of recurrent obstruction.

**Increased Risk:**

* Gastrointestinal perforation:  Monitor for symptoms such as severe, persistent, and worsening abdominal pain.
* Opioid withdrawal symptoms:  This is a possibility, particularly if naldemedine is started suddenly or if opioid dosage is reduced too quickly.

**Drug Interactions:**

* Avoid concurrent use with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) as they can decrease naldemedine's effectiveness.
* Avoid use with other opioid antagonists due to the potential for additive effects and increased risk of opioid withdrawal.
* P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: Monitor for potential increased naldemedine adverse effects due to higher plasma concentrations.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Naldemedine may cross the placenta and potentially cause opioid withdrawal in the fetus.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  The decision to breastfeed while taking naldemedine should be made carefully, weighing the risks and benefits.  Discontinuing naldemedine three days before resuming breastfeeding is suggested to minimize infant exposure.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take naldemedine with food?**  A:  Naldemedine can be taken without regard to meals.

**Q: How long does it take to work?** A: While not explicitly stated, effectiveness is best established after at least 4 weeks of opioid use. Patients taking opioids for less than 4 weeks might not respond as well.

**Q: Do I need to change my opioid dosage before starting naldemedine?** A: No, altering the analgesic regimen before starting naldemedine is generally not required.

**Q: How should I store naldemedine?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product label.
