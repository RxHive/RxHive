# Nedocromil (Oral inhalation)
### Generic Name
Nedocromil (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Nedocromil oral inhalation is primarily used for the prophylactic (preventative) treatment of mild to moderate asthma.  It's designed to prevent asthma attacks, not to treat them once they've started.  It's also effective in preventing bronchospasm triggered by various factors, including exercise, exposure to cold air, and inhalation of allergens, pollutants, or other irritants.  It works by reducing the inflammation in the airways, thereby preventing the constriction that leads to asthma symptoms.  Nedocromil is not a rescue medication for acute asthma attacks.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Asthma:** The usual starting dose is two 4 mg inhalations four times a day (QID). Once symptoms are well-controlled, the doctor may reduce this to two 4 mg inhalations twice a day (BID).
* **Bronchospasm Prevention:** Two 4 mg inhalations should be taken a few minutes before anticipated exposure to a trigger (e.g., exercise, cold air, allergens).

**Children (aged >2 years):**

The dosage for children over 2 years of age is the same as for adults. However,  a doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on the child's specific needs and response to treatment.

**Dosage Forms:**  Nedocromil is available as a metered-dose inhaler (MDI).  Always follow the instructions provided with your specific inhaler.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Cough
* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Increased cough
* Bronchospasm (in some cases)
* Throat irritation

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** While rare, allergic reactions can occur. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or hives.


### How it Works

Nedocromil is a mast cell stabilizer.  It works by preventing the release of inflammatory substances (such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from mast cells in the airways. These substances are key players in the inflammatory response that triggers asthma symptoms. By inhibiting their release, nedocromil helps keep the airways open and prevents bronchospasm.  It also affects other inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nedocromil should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to nedocromil sodium or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While significant drug interactions are not commonly reported, it's essential to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and other inhaled medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nedocromil is categorized as pregnancy category B.  However, caution is advised during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. The excretion of nedocromil in breast milk is unknown; therefore, it's generally advised to avoid using nedocromil while breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Nedocromil should be tapered off gradually and not stopped abruptly. It's a preventative medication and should not be used to treat acute asthma attacks.  Patients should always have a rescue inhaler readily available for acute symptoms.  Correct inhaler technique is crucial for effective delivery.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Nedocromil for an acute asthma attack?** A: No, Nedocromil is a preventative medication, not a rescue medication. Use a prescribed rescue inhaler for acute symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store Nedocromil?** A: Store the inhaler at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and excessive heat or moisture.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full therapeutic effect of Nedocromil may take several weeks to develop.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I use Nedocromil with other asthma medications?** A: Yes, often Nedocromil is used in conjunction with other asthma medications. Your doctor will determine the appropriate combination for your individual needs.  If using with a bronchodilator, the bronchodilator should be administered *before* the Nedocromil.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.  Stop using the medication immediately if you experience a severe allergic reaction.
