# Naratriptan
### Generic Name
Naratriptan

### Usage
Naratriptan is a triptan medication primarily used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults, both with and without aura.  It's specifically designed to relieve the pain and associated symptoms of a migraine headache once it has begun.  It is *not* intended for the prevention of migraines or for treating other types of headaches, such as cluster headaches.  While not officially approved for this purpose, some clinicians may use it off-label for menstrual migraine prevention.

### Dosage
**Adult Migraine Treatment:** The recommended starting dose is 1-2.5 mg orally. If symptoms don't fully resolve or return, a second dose of 1-2.5 mg may be taken after at least 4 hours have passed, but the total daily dose should not exceed 5 mg.  The safety of using naratriptan to treat more than an average of four migraine attacks in a 30-day period hasn't been fully established.

**Off-Label Menstrual Migraine Prevention:**  For this off-label use, the typical dosage is 1 mg twice daily (BID), starting 2-3 days before the anticipated onset of menstruation and continuing for a total of 5-6 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Individuals with mild to moderate liver or kidney impairment should start with a lower dose (1 mg) and not exceed a total daily dose of 2.5 mg. Naratriptan is contraindicated in patients with severe liver or kidney impairment.  Dosage adjustments for children are not established; this medication is not currently approved for pediatric use.

Naratriptan is available in tablet form and should be swallowed whole with liquid; do not crush or chew the tablet.

### How it Works
Naratriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub>).  This means it binds to specific serotonin receptors in the brain and blood vessels of the head. By activating these receptors, naratriptan constricts blood vessels in the brain, reducing the inflammation and nerve stimulation believed to contribute to migraine pain.  It also helps block the release of certain inflammatory substances. This combined action leads to pain relief and other symptom improvements associated with a migraine attack.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Naratriptan should not be used by individuals with:

* Allergy to naratriptan or other triptans
* Coronary artery disease (CAD), including angina, history of heart attack, or silent ischemia
* Coronary artery vasospasm (including Prinzmetal's angina)
* Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or other arrhythmias related to accessory cardiac conduction pathways
* Peripheral vascular disease
* Ischemic bowel disease
* Uncontrolled hypertension
* History of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or hemiplegic or basilar migraine
* Recent use (within 24 hours) of another 5-HT1 agonist, ergotamine, or ergot-type medication
* Severe renal or hepatic impairment
* Severe hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias (especially tachycardias)
* Valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, or atherosclerotic disease


**Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate kidney or liver impairment. Naratriptan may increase the risk of:

* Hypertensive crisis
* Serotonin syndrome
* Arrhythmias
* Myocardial ischemia or infarction
* Cerebrovascular events
* Vasospasm
* Visual disturbances (including transient or permanent vision loss)
* Elevated blood pressure
* Anaphylactic reactions
* Medication overuse headache

Naratriptan should be used with caution in patients taking other medications, particularly those affecting serotonin levels (e.g., certain antidepressants) or blood pressure.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are currently using.  Discuss the use of naratriptan with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have other health concerns.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take naratriptan with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and other migraine medications, as interactions may occur.  Specifically, avoid using naratriptan with other triptans or ergot derivatives within 24 hours.

* **Q: How should I store naratriptan?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Naratriptan is used for acute migraine treatment; missed doses are not applicable in this context.  If a migraine starts, take the medication as soon as possible.

* **Q: Is naratriptan safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term safety hasn't been thoroughly established. Frequent use of acute migraine medication can lead to medication overuse headache.  Discuss your treatment plan with your doctor.

* **Q:  Can I drive after taking naratriptan?** A: Since naratriptan can cause dizziness or drowsiness, avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking naratriptan?** A: Itâ€™s best to avoid alcohol while taking naratriptan, as alcohol can worsen some side effects and may interact with the medication.  Consult your doctor if you have concerns.
