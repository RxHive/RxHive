# Naratriptan

**Generic Name:** Naratriptan

**Usage:** Naratriptan is a triptan used to treat migraine headaches with or without aura in adults.  It's used for *acute* treatment â€“ meaning it's taken *during* a migraine attack to relieve symptoms, not to prevent them.  It does *not* prevent future migraines.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Somnolence (sleepiness):** Feeling unusually drowsy or tired.
* **Weakness:** General feeling of lack of strength.
* **Warmth or flushing:** Sensation of warmth or redness in the skin.
* **Pressure sensation in the chest or throat:**  A feeling of tightness or pressure.  This is usually not serious but should be reported to a doctor.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Dry mouth:** Reduced saliva production.
* **Fatigue:** Extreme tiredness or lack of energy.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Serious allergic reactions:** (Rare)  Symptoms can include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing or swallowing.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Heart problems:** (Rare)  Such as increased heart rate, chest pain, or irregular heartbeat.  Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions should use caution and consult their doctor.
* **Seizures:** (Rare)  Sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain.
* **Stroke or heart attack:** (Very rare)  Extremely uncommon but a possibility, especially for those with risk factors.


**How it Works:** Naratriptan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist.  This means it works by binding to specific receptors in the brain and blood vessels.  By activating these receptors, naratriptan constricts blood vessels in the brain (narrowing them), and reduces the release of inflammatory substances, helping to relieve migraine pain and associated symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.


**FAQs:**

* **How often can I take naratriptan?**  Follow your doctor's instructions.  Typically, it's taken only when a migraine begins and not more than one dose in a 24-hour period.
* **Can I take naratriptan with other medications?**  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, you are taking.  Some medications may interact with naratriptan.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Naratriptan is used for acute treatment, not on a regular schedule.  If you miss a dose because you're not having a migraine, do not take it.  Take a dose only *during* a migraine attack as needed.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects usually resolve on their own.  If you experience serious side effects or side effects that persist or worsen, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.
