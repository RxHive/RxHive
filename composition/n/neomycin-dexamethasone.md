# Neomycin + Dexamethasone

**Generic Name:** Neomycin sulfate and dexamethasone ophthalmic

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat eye infections that respond to both an antibiotic (neomycin) and a steroid (dexamethasone).  It's commonly prescribed for bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) accompanied by inflammation.  The neomycin fights the bacterial infection, and the dexamethasone reduces inflammation and swelling.  It's crucial to note that this medication is *not* effective against viral or fungal infections.  It's only used for bacterial infections diagnosed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Neomycin + Dexamethasone ophthalmic can cause side effects, although they are not experienced by everyone.  Common side effects include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye upon application.
* Itching
* Temporary blurred vision
* Eye redness
* Increased eye pressure (rare, but serious â€“ requires immediate medical attention)
* Eyelid irritation

Rare but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (such as rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Secondary infection (due to suppression of the normal eye flora by the antibiotic)
* Cataracts
* Glaucoma

**How it Works:**

* **Neomycin sulfate:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by interfering with the protein synthesis of bacteria, leading to bacterial cell death and therefore resolving the infection.
* **Dexamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It reduces inflammation by decreasing the body's immune response in the eye. This lessens swelling, redness, and discomfort.

The combination of these two components provides both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory actions necessary for effective treatment of certain bacterial eye infections.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I use it with contact lenses?**  No. You should not wear contact lenses while using this medication. Remove contact lenses before applying the drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any serious side effects, such as allergic reactions or significant increases in eye pressure, stop using the medication and contact your doctor immediately. For less serious side effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

* **Can I use this for any type of eye infection?** No, it's only effective against bacterial conjunctivitis.  It won't work for viral or fungal infections and may even worsen them.  A proper diagnosis from a doctor is essential.
