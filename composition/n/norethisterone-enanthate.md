# Norethisterone enanthate

**Generic Name:** Norethisterone enanthate

**Usage:**

Norethisterone enanthate is a long-acting progestogen (a type of female hormone) primarily used for:

* **Contraception:**  It's used as a long-acting injectable contraceptive, offering protection against pregnancy for several months.  It's often a choice for women who prefer infrequent injections over daily pills or other methods.
* **Hormone therapy:** In some cases, it may be used as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to manage menopausal symptoms, particularly heavy menstrual bleeding. However, its use in HRT is less common compared to other progestogens.
* **Treatment of endometriosis:**  It can be used to suppress endometrial growth, helping manage symptoms of endometriosis.  This is less common as more effective treatments exist.
* **Treatment of uterine bleeding:** It can help control excessive uterine bleeding (menorrhagia) in some women.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Weight gain, irregular bleeding (spotting, breakthrough bleeding), mood changes (depression, anxiety), acne, breast tenderness, headache, fluid retention.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Thromboembolic events (blood clots in the legs or lungs), increased risk of cardiovascular disease (especially in smokers or those with risk factors), changes in libido, changes in cholesterol levels.  Liver problems, jaundice, and allergic reactions are also possible.


**How it Works:**

Norethisterone enanthate works primarily by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  This prevents pregnancy.  It also thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg, and alters the uterine lining, making it less hospitable for implantation. In other uses, its effects on the endometrium help reduce bleeding and manage endometriosis symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does the effect last?** The duration of action depends on the dose but typically provides contraceptive protection for 2-3 months.
* **Is it reversible?** Yes, once injections stop, fertility usually returns within a few months.
* **Who shouldn't use it?**  Women with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, liver disease, or unexplained vaginal bleeding should generally not use norethisterone enanthate.  Those who smoke and are over 35 also face increased risks.  It's important to discuss suitability with a doctor.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Norethisterone enanthate can interact with certain medications, including some anticonvulsants and antibiotics. It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Are there alternatives?**  Yes, many other contraceptive methods and treatments for endometriosis and abnormal uterine bleeding are available.  Your doctor can discuss the best option for you.
