# Norfloxacin

**Generic Name:** Norfloxacin

**Usage:** Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including:

* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  This is a common use.  It's often prescribed for uncomplicated UTIs.
* **Prostatitis:**  Infection of the prostate gland.
* **Gonorrhea:**  A sexually transmitted infection (STI), although resistance is increasing and other antibiotics are often preferred.
* **Infections of the intestines:**  Such as traveler's diarrhea caused by specific bacteria.
* **Infections of the skin and soft tissues:** In some cases.
* **Respiratory tract infections:**  In certain situations, usually only in combination with other drugs.

**Important Note:** Norfloxacin is *not* effective against viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Always consult a doctor to determine the appropriate antibiotic for your specific infection.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, norfloxacin can cause side effects. Some are common and mild, while others are rare but serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Insomnia:**
* **Rash:**

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Tendonitis and tendon rupture:**  This is a potentially serious side effect, especially in older adults and those taking corticosteroids.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:**  Numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities.
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare but can be serious.
* **Seizures:**  Rare, but more likely in those with a history of seizures or kidney problems.
* **QT prolongation:**  An abnormal heart rhythm.
* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis.


**How it Works:** Norfloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by interfering with an enzyme (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) that bacteria need to replicate their DNA.  By inhibiting this enzyme, norfloxacin prevents bacterial growth and ultimately leads to their death.
