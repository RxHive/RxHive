# Norfloxacin
### Generic Name
Norfloxacin

### Usage
Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial infections, particularly those of the urinary tract.  Its main uses include uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including cystitis and prostatitis.  While it's been used in the past for uncomplicated gonorrhea, current guidelines no longer recommend fluoroquinolones for this purpose due to emerging resistance.  Norfloxacin may also be used off-label in certain situations, such as dysenteric enterocolitis (Shigella infection),  prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and traveler's diarrhea.  However, these off-label uses should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  It's crucial to remember that Norfloxacin should be reserved for patients without alternative treatment options for uncomplicated UTIs due to the risk of potentially serious side effects.


### Dosage

**Adults:** Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated and its severity.  

* **Uncomplicated UTI (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis):** 400 mg twice daily (BID) for 3 days.
* **Uncomplicated UTI (other organisms):** 400 mg BID for 7-10 days.
* **Complicated UTI:** 400 mg BID for 10-21 days.
* **Prostatitis:** 400 mg every 12 hours for 4-6 weeks.
* **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (Note:  This is outdated; consult current CDC guidelines):** 800 mg as a single dose.
* **Off-label uses (Dosage varies significantly based on the condition; consult a healthcare professional):**  The dosage for off-label uses such as dysenteric enterocolitis, SBP prophylaxis, or traveler's diarrhea will differ significantly.  A doctor should provide specific instructions.


**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Norfloxacin in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≤30 mL/min.  In these cases, the typical dose is 400 mg once daily (OD).
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment. However, it's essential to monitor liver function tests.


**Administration:** Norfloxacin is typically administered orally. It should be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after meals, milk, or other dairy products.  Antacids, sucralfate, or multivitamins containing certain minerals should not be taken concurrently.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Abdominal cramping
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils in the blood)
* Increased serum liver enzyme levels


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<0.3%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Tendinitis and tendon rupture
* Peripheral neuropathy
* CNS effects (seizures, increased intracranial pressure, psychosis, confusion, hallucinations)
*  Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
*  QT prolongation (potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormality)
*  Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea
*  Acute renal failure
*  Hepatic failure or necrosis
*  Anaphylaxis

A complete list of potential side effects is extensive.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Norfloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase, an enzyme crucial for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and other processes.  By blocking this enzyme, Norfloxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death. This action targets a wide range of bacteria, giving it broad-spectrum activity.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Known hypersensitivity to Norfloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or any formulation components.
* History of tendonitis or tendon rupture associated with quinolone use.

**Warnings:**

* Fluoroquinolones, including Norfloxacin, are associated with potentially irreversible and serious side effects (tendinitis/tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects). Discontinue immediately if these occur and avoid future fluoroquinolone use.
* Norfloxacin may prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of dangerous heart rhythms.  Patients with existing heart conditions should be closely monitored.
* Norfloxacin may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.
* Patients should be advised to avoid excessive sun exposure.
* May increase the risk of seizures, particularly in patients with underlying CNS disorders or risk factors.
* May cause disordered glucose regulation.
* May interact with numerous medications (see Interactions section).

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with renal or hepatic impairment (dosage adjustment may be needed).
* In pregnant or breastfeeding women (benefits must outweigh potential risks).  Information about excretion in breast milk is limited.
* In older adults (increased risk of adverse effects).

**Drug Interactions:** Norfloxacin can interact with a broad range of medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Norfloxacin with antacids?** A: No, antacids and other medications containing minerals like calcium, magnesium, iron, or aluminum interfere with Norfloxacin absorption.  Separate administration by at least 2 hours is recommended.

* **Q: How should I store Norfloxacin?** A: Store Norfloxacin at room temperature, away from moisture and light, and out of the reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Is Norfloxacin safe for pregnant women?** A:  Norfloxacin is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  Use should be carefully considered, only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. A doctor should make this decision.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Norfloxacin?** A: While there is no specific contraindication of alcohol with Norfloxacin, excessive alcohol intake can worsen some side effects like nausea and dizziness. Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q:  What should I do if I develop a serious side effect?** A:  Stop taking Norfloxacin immediately and seek medical attention.  Serious side effects require immediate intervention.
