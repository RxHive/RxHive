# Naphazoline + Pheniramine

**Generic Name:** Naphazoline + Pheniramine

**Usage:**  This combination medication is a nasal decongestant and antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose associated with the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies.  Naphazoline works as a vasoconstrictor (shrinks blood vessels in the nose), reducing swelling and congestion. Pheniramine is an antihistamine that helps reduce runny nose and sneezing caused by allergies.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but common ones include:

* **Burning/stinging sensation in the nose:** This is relatively common, especially immediately after application.
* **Drowsiness:** Pheniramine can cause drowsiness.
* **Rebound congestion:**  Prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion, where the nasal congestion worsens after stopping the medication. This is why it's crucial to follow the recommended dosage and duration of use.
* **Headache:**  Less frequent but possible.
* **Dryness in the nose/mouth/throat:** This is a common side effect of decongestants.
* **Nausea:**  Less frequent.
* **Insomnia:** In some cases, particularly if taken later in the day.
* **Irritability:**  Less frequent.
* **High blood pressure (rare but possible):** Especially in individuals already predisposed to hypertension.
* **Allergic reactions:** While rare, allergic reactions such as rash or hives can occur.  Stop use and seek medical attention if this happens.


**How it Works:**

* **Naphazoline:** This is a sympathomimetic amine that acts directly on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages.  This causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), reducing swelling and mucus production, thus relieving congestion.

* **Pheniramine:** This is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. By blocking histamine, pheniramine helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and itching associated with allergies.

* **Can I use this medication with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions may occur.
