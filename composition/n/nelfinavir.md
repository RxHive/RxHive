# Nelfinavir
### Generic Name
Nelfinavir

### Usage
Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor, a type of antiretroviral drug.  Its primary use is in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It's crucial to understand that nelfinavir is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral medications as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.  It's not effective as a standalone treatment for HIV. The combination approach helps to suppress the virus more effectively and prevent the development of resistance.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (HIV-1 Infection):**  The typical adult dose is 750 mg three times daily (TID) or 1250 mg twice daily (BID), always taken with other antiretroviral drugs.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual factors and should be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Pediatric Dosage (HIV-1 Infection):** Dosing for children aged 2 years and older is weight-based.  There's no established dose for infants and children younger than 2 years.  The weight-based dosing ranges from 45-55 mg/kg/dose (maximum 1250 mg/dose) BID or 25-35 mg/kg/dose (maximum 750 mg/dose) TID.  Fixed-dose regimens are also available based on weight categories.  Precise dosing for children should be determined by a pediatrician experienced in managing HIV infection.  Daily doses exceeding 2500 mg have not been established in children.  Adolescents typically receive the adult dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A).  However, nelfinavir is not recommended for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C).  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment; this should be discussed with a doctor.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Liver problems (hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests)
* Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis)
* Severe allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)
* Changes in blood cell counts (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)
*  Metabolic changes (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lipodystrophy)
* Neurological effects (anxiety, depression, insomnia, seizures)

If any serious or concerning side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.  Even seemingly minor side effects warrant discussion with a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Nelfinavir is a protease inhibitor.  HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, needs a protease enzyme to replicate and become infectious. Nelfinavir works by binding to the HIV-1 protease, blocking its activity.  This prevents the virus from producing mature, infectious viral particles, thereby suppressing viral replication and reducing the viral load in the body.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Nelfinavir is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to nelfinavir or any of its components.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment. It's contraindicated in those with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Nelfinavir can interact with many other medications, potentially affecting their efficacy or causing adverse effects.  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, before starting nelfinavir.  Careful monitoring might be needed.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Nelfinavir is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. While generally considered safe for pregnant women, the benefits must be carefully weighed against potential risks.  Itâ€™s excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers need to discuss this with their doctor and consider the risk to the infant.
* **Other Precautions:** Nelfinavir can increase blood glucose levels and lipid levels. Regular monitoring of blood glucose and lipid profiles is essential, especially in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperlipidemia.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take nelfinavir with antacids?** A:  No, antacids can significantly reduce the effectiveness of nelfinavir.  Avoid taking them concurrently.
* **Q: How should I store nelfinavir?** A:  Store nelfinavir as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking nelfinavir if I feel better?** A:  No, never stop taking nelfinavir or any antiretroviral medication without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to viral resistance and disease progression.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q:  Is nelfinavir a cure for HIV?** A: No, nelfinavir is not a cure for HIV, but it's a vital component of the treatment that helps to manage the infection and improve quality of life.
