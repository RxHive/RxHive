# Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Methylcellulose + Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate
### Generic Name
Naphazoline + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Methylcellulose + Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate (Note: This combination is typically found in ophthalmic solutions.  The exact brand name and formulation may vary.)


### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used as an ophthalmic solution (eye drops) to treat symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the sclera).  It targets several symptoms simultaneously:

* **Naphazoline:** A sympathomimetic decongestant, it constricts blood vessels in the eyes, reducing redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, it blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions.  This helps alleviate itching, swelling, and watery eyes.
* **Methylcellulose:**  A viscosity-increasing agent; it acts as a lubricant, helping to soothe irritated eyes and prolong the contact time of the active ingredients with the eye's surface.
* **Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate:** A preservative that helps prevent microbial growth in the solution.  (Note:  Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate is being phased out in many countries due to toxicity concerns.  Look for newer formulations without this preservative.)


The primary use is for symptom relief; this medication does not cure the underlying allergic condition.


### Dosage
Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific brand and formulation.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or by your ophthalmologist or healthcare provider.  Generally, for adults and children over 6 years old, one or two drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) several times a day as needed, but not more frequently than every 4 hours.  Use in children under 6 years old should be guided by a physician.   **Never exceed the recommended dosage.**  This medication is for topical use in the eyes only; do not ingest it.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or temporary blurry vision upon application.  Mild eye irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased eye pressure (especially in individuals with pre-existing glaucoma), allergic reactions (including rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), and irregular heartbeat (palpitations).
* **Long-term use side effects (with naphazoline):** Rebound congestion (worsening of symptoms after stopping the medication).

**If you experience any of these side effects, particularly serious ones, stop using the medication and contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works
This combination works by targeting different aspects of allergic conjunctivitis:

* **Naphazoline:** Reduces redness and swelling by constricting blood vessels in the conjunctiva.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the effects of histamine, reducing itching, swelling, and watery eyes.
* **Methylcellulose:** Soothes irritated eyes by providing lubrication.
* **Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate (preservative):** Prevents microbial contamination of the eye drops.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to any of its components.  Those with narrow-angle glaucoma or individuals on MAO inhibitors should exercise caution and consult their physician before use.
* **Drug Interactions:** Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications, particularly other eye drops or medications affecting blood pressure or heart rate.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
