# Nevirapine

**Generic Name:** Nevirapine

**Usage:** Nevirapine is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1 infection.  It's typically part of a combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, not used alone.  It's used in both adults and children, often in specific situations such as:

* **Treatment of HIV-1 infection:** As part of a combination ART regimen to reduce the viral load and improve CD4+ T-cell counts.
* **Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV:** Given to pregnant women with HIV-1 to prevent transmission to their infants.  This often includes a single dose during labor and a course for the infant.


**Side Effects:**  Nevirapine can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:**  Rash (sometimes severe), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain.
* **Serious side effects:** Severe skin rash (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), liver damage (hepatitis),  blood disorders (thrombocytopenia, anemia),  central nervous system effects (seizures, drowsiness, confusion), allergic reactions.  A rare but serious side effect is a severe rash that can be life-threatening.
* **Specific to women:**  Nevirapine can interact with hormonal contraceptives, decreasing their effectiveness.


**How it Works:** Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  It works by blocking the action of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV uses to replicate its genetic material (RNA) into DNA.  By inhibiting reverse transcriptase, nevirapine prevents the virus from multiplying and spreading within the body.
