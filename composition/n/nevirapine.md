# Nevirapine
### Generic Name
Nevirapine

### Usage
Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat HIV-1 infection.  It's a crucial part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens, and its primary use is to suppress HIV replication, slowing the progression of the disease and improving the patient's quality of life.  While not used alone, it plays a vital role in effectively managing HIV.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (HIV-1 infection):**

* **Initial Therapy (Immediate-Release):** 200 mg once daily for 14 days.  This is a "lead-in" period to monitor for adverse effects.

* **Maintenance Therapy (Immediate-Release):** If no rash or other significant side effects occur during the initial 14 days, the dose is increased to 200 mg twice daily in combination with other antiretrovirals.

* **Maintenance Therapy (Extended-Release):** 400 mg once daily.  This formulation should only be used after completing the 14-day lead-in period with the immediate-release formulation, unless the patient is already on a nevirapine immediate-release regimen.

**Pediatric Dosage (HIV-1 infection):** Dosage is complex and depends on age and weight (often calculated using body surface area, or BSA).  Always follow a doctor's specific instructions.  Generally, initial therapy involves a lead-in period with lower doses of the immediate-release formulation, followed by dose adjustments based on tolerance.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Nevirapine is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.  Use with caution in patients with mild impairment. Treatment should be stopped immediately if any signs of liver problems appear.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 20 mL/min.  For those with CrCl < 20 mL/min, dosage recommendations are not established.  An additional dose may be recommended after hemodialysis.

* **Rash:** If a rash develops, especially during the initial 14 days, the dose should not be increased.  Severe rash, rash with constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, etc.), or rash with elevated liver enzymes necessitates immediate discontinuation of Nevirapine. If therapy is interrupted for more than 7 days, it must be restarted with the immediate-release formulation for 14 days.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Rash (can be serious; see Precautions)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity), potentially fatal
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult a healthcare provider if you experience any side effects.


### How it Works

Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  It works by binding directly to the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for HIV to replicate its genetic material.  By blocking this enzyme's activity, Nevirapine prevents the virus from making copies of itself, reducing the viral load in the body.  It doesn't need to be converted into an active form within the body to be effective.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Nevirapine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to nevirapine or any of its components, and in those with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment. It's also contraindicated for use in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Nevirapine can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or causing increased side effects. Discuss all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal) with your doctor before starting Nevirapine.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Nevirapine is a Pregnancy Category B drug, but there is a heightened risk of severe hepatotoxicity, especially during the first 18 weeks of pregnancy.  Women with higher CD4 counts are at greater risk.  It's excreted in breast milk, potentially harming the infant, so breastfeeding should be avoided.

* **Hepatotoxicity and Skin Reactions:**  Close monitoring is crucial during the initial 18 weeks of treatment, particularly the first 6 weeks, for signs of liver damage (hepatotoxicity) and severe skin reactions (rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).  These can be life-threatening.  Discontinue nevirapine immediately if such reactions occur.

* **Elevated CD4 counts:**  In antiretroviral-naive patients, initiating therapy with nevirapine should be avoided if they have high CD4 counts (over 250 cells/mm³ for adult females, and over 400 cells/mm³ for adult males) unless the benefits outweigh the risk of hepatotoxicity.  Nevirapine is not usually a first-line therapy for HIV.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Nevirapine with food?** A:  Nevirapine can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Nevirapine?** A:  Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose. Consult your doctor if you have concerns about missed doses.

* **Q:  Is Nevirapine a cure for HIV?** A:  No, Nevirapine is not a cure, but it's an important part of combination therapy to manage HIV infection and improve quality of life.

* **Q:  What if I develop a rash?** A:  Rashes can be a serious side effect. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop any rash, especially during the first few weeks of treatment. Liver function tests should be performed immediately.
