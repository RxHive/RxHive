# Norgestrel
### Generic Name
Norgestrel

### Usage
Norgestrel is a synthetic progestin primarily used in female contraception.  Its main function is to prevent pregnancy.  It achieves this by acting on progesterone receptors, altering the uterine lining to prevent implantation and suppressing ovulation. While its primary use is as a contraceptive, it's not typically used for any other significant medical conditions.

### Dosage
**Contraception (Females):**  The standard dosage is one tablet orally once daily.  This should be taken at the same time each day, without interruption, regardless of whether bleeding occurs. Treatment should begin on the first day of menstruation.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of norgestrel in children have not been established.  It is not indicated for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with renal impairment.  However, caution is advised.  Norgestrel is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or a history of benign or malignant liver tumors.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Edema (swelling)
* Breakthrough bleeding or spotting
* Changes in menstrual flow (e.g., heavier, lighter, absent periods)
* Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
* Weakness
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Embolism (blood clot)
* Central thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein due to a blood clot)
* Increased breast tenderness
* Weight changes
* Cholestatic jaundice (jaundice caused by impaired bile flow)
* Mental depression
* Fever
* Insomnia
* Melasma (skin discoloration)
* Chloasma (skin discoloration, often on the face)
* Rashes


If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Norgestrel is a progestogen that mimics the action of the natural hormone progesterone.  It works primarily by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). It also thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg, and alters the uterine lining, making it less receptive to a fertilized egg. This multifaceted approach reduces the chances of conception.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Norgestrel is contraindicated (should not be used) in the following situations:

* Hypersensitivity to norgestrel or any formulation component.
* History of arterial or venous thromboembolism (blood clots).
* Unexplained abnormal vaginal bleeding.
* Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure).
* Diabetes mellitus with vascular involvement.
* History of jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) with prior oral contraceptive use.
* History of migraine with aura.
* History of cerebrovascular disorders (stroke).
* History of myocardial infarction (heart attack) or coronary artery disease.
* Active liver disease or history of benign or malignant liver tumors.
* Known or suspected breast cancer.
* Known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia (cancer).
* Ocular lesions from ophthalmic vascular disease (e.g., vision loss).
* Suspected or confirmed pregnancy.


**Warnings/Increased Risk:**  Use with caution and careful monitoring is necessary in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, sex-steroid dependent cancer, functional ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, malabsorption syndromes, conditions worsened by fluid retention, renal impairment, and fibroids.  Norgestrel increases the risk of blood clots, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), chloasma, ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cysts, migraines, diabetes, and changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

**Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use of norgestrel with idelalisib or ivacaftor should be avoided or used with extreme caution due to potential interactions affecting metabolism and increasing norgestrel levels.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Norgestrel is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it is contraindicated during pregnancy.  It is excreted in breast milk, so the benefits of breastfeeding must be weighed against potential risks to the infant.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take norgestrel with food?**  A: Yes, norgestrel can be taken with or without food.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a pill?** A:  Take the missed pill as soon as you remember. If more than 3 hours late, use a backup method of contraception (like condoms) for the next 48 hours.

**Q: Is norgestrel for emergency contraception?** A: No, norgestrel tablets are not for emergency contraception.

**Q: How should I store norgestrel?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

**Q: How long does it take to be effective?** A:  It's most effective when taken consistently as directed from the first day of menstruation.  Use backup contraception until then.
