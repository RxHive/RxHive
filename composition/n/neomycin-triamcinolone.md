# Neomycin + Triamcinolone

**Generic Name:** Neomycin and Triamcinolone Acetonide

**Usage:**  This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic used to treat skin conditions that are both inflamed and infected.  It's typically prescribed for bacterial skin infections accompanied by inflammation, such as:

* Impetigo
* Eczema (with secondary bacterial infection)
* Psoriasis (with secondary bacterial infection)
* Dermatitis (with secondary bacterial infection)
* Other inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial involvement.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the duration of use. Common side effects include:

* **Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site:** This is often mild and temporary.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):**  Prolonged use, especially on delicate skin areas, can lead to skin thinning, making the skin more susceptible to damage.
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  Can occur with prolonged use.
* **Acne-like eruptions:**  Especially common in certain individuals.
* **Dryness or irritation:**  May occur.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:**  An allergic reaction to one or both components of the medication is possible.
* **Systemic effects (rare, but possible with extensive use or damaged skin):**  Absorption of the medication through the skin can rarely lead to systemic side effects, particularly with children or when used over large areas of skin.  This may include adrenal suppression (reduced cortisol production).


**How it Works:**

* **Neomycin:**  This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately killing bacteria and reducing infection.
* **Triamcinolone Acetonide:** This is a corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response in the skin. By reducing inflammation, it helps alleviate redness, swelling, itching, and pain associated with the skin condition.  The combined effect of the antibiotic and corticosteroid helps control both the infection and the inflammation simultaneously.
