# Naloxegol
### Generic Name
Naloxegol

### Usage
Naloxegol is a medication specifically designed to treat opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults.  OIC is a common side effect of opioid painkillers often used for chronic non-cancer pain. This includes individuals experiencing chronic pain stemming from past cancer or its treatment, provided they don't need frequent increases in their opioid dosage (e.g., weekly).  It's crucial to understand that Naloxegol doesn't treat the underlying pain; it solely addresses the constipation caused by opioid use.

### Dosage
**Opioid-induced constipation:**

* **Adults:** The typical starting dose is 25 mg once daily (OD). If this dose isn't well-tolerated, it can be reduced to 12.5 mg OD.  If the opioid pain medication is discontinued, Naloxegol should also be stopped.  Any maintenance laxatives should be stopped before starting Naloxegol.  If constipation persists after three days of treatment, laxatives may be reintroduced as needed.  No change to the opioid analgesic dose is required before starting Naloxegol.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Naloxegol in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For those with mild to moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), no dosage adjustment is necessary. However, Naloxegol should be avoided in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C) as its safety and effectiveness haven't been established in this population.

* **Renal Impairment:**  In individuals with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 60 mL/minute or higher, no dosage adjustment is needed. If CrCl is below 60 mL/minute or if the patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the starting dose should be 12.5 mg OD.  If tolerated but constipation persists, the dose may increase to 25 mg OD. However,  it's crucial to consider the potential for significantly increased drug levels and the heightened risk of side effects in patients with renal impairment.  Naloxegol is not effectively removed by dialysis.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Abdominal pain

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Diarrhea
* Flatulence
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Opioid withdrawal syndrome


**Less Frequent but Serious Side Effects (Postmarketing):**

* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Gastrointestinal perforation (a hole in the digestive tract)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Naloxegol is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the effects of opioids in the gut, specifically preventing them from binding to the mu-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. By doing this, it counteracts the constipating effects of opioids without affecting the pain-relieving effects of the opioids in the brain.  This selective action is achieved through a chemical modification (PEGylation) of naloxone, a known opioid antagonist. The modification limits its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Known or suspected serious hypersensitivity reaction to Naloxegol or any ingredient in the formulation.
* Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, or risk of recurrent obstruction.
* Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, ketoconazole).


**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of gastrointestinal effects, including severe abdominal pain and diarrhea, and gastrointestinal perforation.
* Increased risk of opioid withdrawal symptoms.

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with renal impairment.  Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice during treatment.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**

Naloxegol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It may cause opioid withdrawal in pregnant women and their fetuses.  Because excretion in breast milk is unknown and there is a risk of serious adverse reactions in the infant (including opioid withdrawal), breastfeeding is not recommended while using Naloxegol.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Naloxegol with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Concurrent use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and some opioid antagonists, is not recommended due to potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store Naloxegol?** A: Store Naloxegol as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A: The effects of Naloxegol may vary, but improvement in constipation should be observed within days.
* **Q:  Can I crush Naloxegol tablets?** A:  Generally, tablets should be swallowed whole. However, if swallowing a whole tablet is difficult, it may be crushed and mixed with water and consumed immediately.  Follow your doctor or pharmacistâ€™s instructions.
* **Q:  Is Naloxegol effective for everyone with opioid-induced constipation?** A:  Naloxegol is not effective for everyone, and response may vary. Factors like the type and dose of opioid used and individual patient factors can influence effectiveness.
