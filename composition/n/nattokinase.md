# Nattokinase
### Generic Name
Nattokinase

### Usage
Nattokinase is an enzyme derived from natto, a fermented soybean food.  It's primarily marketed as a dietary supplement, purportedly offering fibrinolytic and thrombolytic effects (breaking down blood clots).  However, it's crucial to understand that **robust clinical evidence supporting these claims is lacking**.  While some studies suggest potential benefits in blood pressure management and improving blood flow, further research is needed to confirm these effects and establish efficacy.  Currently, nattokinase is not approved by regulatory bodies like the FDA for treating any specific medical condition.

### Dosage
**Important Note:**  There's a significant lack of well-designed clinical trials to determine safe and effective dosages of nattokinase.  The information below represents reported dosages from existing, often limited studies, and should not be interpreted as a recommended dosage.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using nattokinase.

* **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) / Fibrinolysis / Thrombolysis:**  Reported dosages in studies have varied, with one common example being 100 mg/day (equivalent to 2000 fibrinolytic units [FU]), often given for 8 weeks.  However, the effectiveness and safety of this dosage have not been conclusively established.

* **Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of nattokinase in children haven't been established.  It's not recommended for use in children.

### Side Effects
While generally considered well-tolerated by some, potential side effects of nattokinase include:

* Bleeding: This is a significant concern, particularly in individuals already at risk for bleeding or taking anticoagulants.
* Late-onset anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction): Although rare, this is a serious potential adverse effect.

It is vital to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Nattokinase's proposed mechanism of action involves several pathways.  It doesn't directly act on plasminogen (a key component in clot breakdown). Instead, it's believed to:

1. Increase the activity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a natural clot-dissolving enzyme, by cleaving plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1).  This leads to increased conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, enhancing clot lysis.
2. Directly break down cross-linked fibrin in blood clots, further contributing to clot dissolution.
3. Reduce blood viscosity (thickness), potentially contributing to improved blood flow and lower blood pressure.  This effect may be linked to its impact on red blood cell aggregation.

The exact mechanisms and their relative contributions remain areas of ongoing research.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Nattokinase is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with ischemic stroke, peptic ulcers, or bleeding disorders. It's also generally inadvisable before and after surgery due to the risk of increased bleeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nattokinase can significantly increase the risk of bleeding when used concurrently with anticoagulants (blood thinners) or antiplatelet agents (drugs that prevent blood clot formation).  The high vitamin K2 content in some nattokinase supplements may interact with warfarin, potentially reducing its effectiveness.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of nattokinase during pregnancy and breastfeeding haven't been established.  It's best avoided during these periods.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to soybeans or Bacillus subtilis should exercise extreme caution.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is nattokinase a proven treatment for high blood pressure?**  A: No, while some studies suggest potential benefits, conclusive evidence is lacking.  It shouldn't replace prescribed medications for hypertension.

* **Q: Can I take nattokinase with blood thinners?** A:  No, it's strongly advised against combining nattokinase with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs due to a significantly increased risk of bleeding.

* **Q: How should I store nattokinase supplements?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the product label. Generally, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop taking the supplement immediately and consult a healthcare professional.
