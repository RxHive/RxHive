### How it Works
Nadifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase, an essential enzyme in bacteria for DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. By inhibiting this enzyme, nadifloxacin prevents bacterial growth and reproduction, thus helping to clear the bacterial infection contributing to acne.
