# Nadifloxacin

**Generic Name:** Nadifloxacin

**Usage:** Nadifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eye.  Specifically, it's often prescribed for bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other superficial bacterial infections of the eye.  It's typically available as an ophthalmic solution (eye drops).  **Important Note:** Nadifloxacin is *not* for systemic use (ingestion or injection).

**Side Effects:**  Like other fluoroquinolones, nadifloxacin can cause various side effects, though many are mild and transient.  These can include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness.
* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild (rash, itching) to severe (anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening allergic reaction).  Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of a serious allergic reaction.
* **Headache**
* **Blurry vision**
* **Taste changes**

Less common side effects may occur.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:** Nadifloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. This means it kills bacteria. It works by inhibiting the activity of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication, repair, and transcription.  By blocking these enzymes, nadifloxacin prevents bacterial growth and ultimately leads to their death.
