# Triprolidine
### Generic Name
Triprolidine

### Usage
Triprolidine is an antihistamine primarily used for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and other upper respiratory allergies. These symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, or throat.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  While its primary use is for allergic symptoms, it's important to note that Triprolidine does not treat the underlying cause of the allergy.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**  The usual adult dose is 2.5 mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 10 mg per day.

**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):**  Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age and the formulation (syrup, liquid, chewable tablet) available.  It's crucial to follow the specific instructions provided by the pharmacist or on the product label. The dosage is usually calculated based on weight and age and is significantly lower than the adult dose.  Always use a precise measuring device (like an oral syringe) to administer liquid formulations to children. Never use a household teaspoon as it may lead to inaccurate measurement and potential overdose.  Examples of pediatric dosing are shown below. However, this should not replace the dosing instructions provided on the package insert of your specific medication.

### How it Works
Triprolidine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine at H1 receptors. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itching. By blocking histamine's action, triprolidine helps relieve these symptoms. It also has anticholinergic effects which contribute to its symptom-relieving properties.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Triprolidine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to triprolidine or any components of the formulation. Concurrent use with other sedatives, tranquilizers, or other triprolidine-containing products should be avoided.  It should not be used in those whose symptoms do not improve within 7 days or are accompanied by fever.
* **Interactions:**  Triprolidine can interact with other medications, particularly central nervous system (CNS) depressants (like alcohol, sedatives, or tranquilizers), aminoglycoside antibiotics, and other anticholinergic drugs. The combined effect can be additive, leading to increased drowsiness or other side effects.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma), hyperthyroidism, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, prostatic hypertrophy, stenosing peptic ulcers, pyloroduodenal obstruction, bladder-neck obstruction, elderly patients, or those performing tasks requiring alertness (driving, operating machinery). Triprolidine is not recommended for use in pregnant women unless the benefit outweighs the potential risks. It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding. Children aged less than 2 years may be at increased risk.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Triprolidine with alcohol?**  A: No, alcohol can increase the drowsiness and other CNS depressant effects of Triprolidine. Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the individual and the formulation.  Relief from symptoms is typically experienced relatively quickly. However, this is just symptom relief, not a cure for the allergy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Triprolidine?** A: Store Triprolidine as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I take Triprolidine long-term?** A: Triprolidine is intended for short-term use only.  Extended use should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
