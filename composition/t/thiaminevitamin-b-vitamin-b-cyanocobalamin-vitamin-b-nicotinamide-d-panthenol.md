# ThiamineVitamin B + Vitamin B + Cyanocobalamin + Vitamin B + Nicotinamide + D-Panthenol

This combination of vitamins lacks a single generic name as it's a blend of several vitamins.  It's important to note that the question is incomplete because "Vitamin B +" is repeated.  We will assume these represent different B vitamins. To provide the most accurate information, we need to know *which* B vitamins are included (B1, B2, B6, etc.).  The following information is therefore general and may not apply precisely to every specific combination containing these vitamins.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any new supplement regimen.


**Generic Name:**  There isn't one.  This would be described as a "Multivitamin Supplement" containing Thiamine (B1), [Specify Missing B Vitamins], Cyanocobalamin (B12), Nicotinamide (B3), and D-Panthenol (Provitamin B5).

**Usage:**

This combination of vitamins is typically used to treat or prevent deficiencies in these specific vitamins. Deficiencies can manifest in various ways depending on the vitamin:

* **Thiamine (B1):** Beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (in alcoholics), fatigue.

Each vitamin plays a crucial role in different metabolic processes within the body.  They act as coenzymes or precursors to coenzymes, meaning they are essential components in many enzyme reactions.  These reactions are vital for:
