# Tadalafil IP
### Generic Name
Tadalafil IP

### Usage
Tadalafil is primarily used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, in adult men.  It works by increasing blood flow to the penis, allowing for a firmer erection during sexual stimulation.  It's important to note that Tadalafil doesn't cause an erection without sexual stimulation.

Beyond ED, Tadalafil is also approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a condition where blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs is abnormally high. It helps to relax and widen these blood vessels, improving blood flow and reducing strain on the heart.  In some cases, it may also be prescribed off-label for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition characterized by an enlarged prostate gland, though this is not its primary indication.


### Dosage

**Dosage for Erectile Dysfunction:**

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose is 10 mg, taken as needed, approximately 30 minutes before sexual activity.  The dose may be increased to 20 mg or decreased to 5 mg based on individual response and tolerance.  A maximum daily dose of 20 mg should not be exceeded.
* **There is no IV formulation of Tadalafil for erectile dysfunction.**


**Dosage for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension:**

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose is 2.5 mg once daily. This may be increased to 40 mg once daily as tolerated.  Dosage adjustments are made based on individual response and are determined by a physician.  
* **There is no IV formulation of Tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension.**


**Important Considerations:**

* **Children:** Tadalafil is not approved for use in children.
* **Older Adults:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for older adults based on kidney and liver function.  A physician will assess individual needs.
* **Specific Patient Populations:** Patients with liver or kidney disease require careful dosage adjustment under the guidance of a doctor.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, flushing (redness of the face, neck, or chest), nasal congestion, indigestion, back pain, muscle aches. These side effects are generally mild and temporary.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Sudden decrease or loss of vision, sudden decrease or loss of hearing, prolonged erection (priapism), heart attack, stroke.  Seek immediate medical attention if any of these occur.


### How it Works

Tadalafil belongs to a class of medications called phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors.  It works by increasing the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a molecule that relaxes smooth muscles in blood vessels.  This increased cGMP leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), particularly in the penis for ED treatment, and in the pulmonary arteries for PAH treatment, thus improving blood flow.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tadalafil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Tadalafil or any of its components.  It should not be used in combination with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (due to risk of dangerously low blood pressure).
* **Drug Interactions:** Tadalafil can interact with other medications, including certain antifungals, antibiotics, and HIV medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in patients with heart conditions, high blood pressure, or a history of stroke. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use Tadalafil.  Consult with your doctor if you have any underlying health conditions before starting this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Tadalafil to work?**  A: For ED, the effects typically begin within 30 minutes of taking the medication. For PAH, the effects are gradual and build over time with regular use.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Tadalafil?** A: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol can interfere with the effectiveness of Tadalafil and increase the risk of side effects.  It's advisable to limit alcohol intake.
* **Q: How should I store Tadalafil?** A: Store Tadalafil in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of Tadalafil?** A: For ED, take the dose as soon as you remember, but if it's close to the time of your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  For PAH, you should contact your physician for advice on managing missed doses.
* **Q: Can I take Tadalafil every day?** A:  For ED, daily use of a lower dose (usually 2.5mg or 5mg) may be considered in some cases, but this must be determined by a physician.  For PAH, it is typically taken daily.  Never exceed the prescribed dosage.
