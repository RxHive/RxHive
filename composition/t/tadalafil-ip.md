# Tadalafil IP

**Generic Name:** Tadalafil IP

**Usage:** Tadalafil IP is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  For ED, it's taken as needed, typically 30 minutes to an hour before sexual activity. For PAH, it's taken daily at a prescribed dosage.  **It is crucial to only take Tadalafil as prescribed by a doctor.**  Improper use can be dangerous.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects of Tadalafil can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Flushing (redness in the face, neck, or chest)
* Nasal congestion
* Upset stomach
* Muscle aches
* Back pain
* Dizziness
* Vision changes (blurred vision, changes in color vision)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Prolonged erection (priapism) â€“ requires immediate medical attention
* Hearing loss
* Vision loss
* Heart attack
* Stroke
* Irregular heartbeat


**How it Works:** Tadalafil belongs to a class of medications called phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors.  For ED, it works by increasing blood flow to the penis, making it easier to achieve and maintain an erection. For PAH, it relaxes blood vessels in the lungs, improving blood flow and reducing pressure in the arteries.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does Tadalafil last?** A: The duration of effect varies depending on the individual and the dosage, but it can last up to 36 hours for ED treatment.  For PAH, the effect is continuous as it's taken daily.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Tadalafil?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally not a problem, but excessive alcohol can increase the risk of side effects.  It's best to consult your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take Tadalafil with other medications?** A:  Tadalafil can interact with other medications, especially nitrates (used to treat angina).  This combination can cause a dangerous drop in blood pressure.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a prolonged erection (priapism)?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention.  A prolonged erection lasting more than 4 hours can cause permanent damage.

* **Q: Is Tadalafil right for me?** A:  Only a doctor can determine if Tadalafil is appropriate for your specific health condition and medical history.  Self-medicating can be dangerous.

* **Q: What are the differences between Tadalafil and other ED medications?** A: While Tadalafil, Viagra (Sildenafil), and Cialis (also Tadalafil) all work similarly, they may have slightly different durations of action and side effect profiles. Your doctor can help you determine which medication is best for you.
