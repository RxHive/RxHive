# Terbinafine (Topical)
### Generic Name
Terbinafine (Topical)

### Usage
Terbinafine topical is an antifungal medication used to treat various fungal skin infections.  Its primary uses include treating tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), and tinea corporis (ringworm).  It's also effective against cutaneous candidiasis (a yeast infection of the skin) and tinea versicolor (a fungal infection causing discoloration of the skin).  The topical form is specifically designed for treating fungal infections affecting the skin's surface.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the type of infection and the formulation (cream, gel, or spray) of terbinafine used.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Tinea pedis (Athlete's foot):** Cream (1%): Apply twice daily (BID) between toes and to the affected area for at least one week, and on the soles/sides of feet for two weeks. Gel (1%): Apply once daily (OD) at bedtime for at least one week. Spray (1%): Apply once daily for at least one week.
* **Tinea corporis (Ringworm) & Tinea cruris (Jock itch):** Cream/gel/spray (1%): Apply once daily for one week.
* **Cutaneous candidiasis:** Cream (1%): Apply once or twice daily for one to two weeks.
* **Tinea versicolor:** Cream (1%): Apply once or twice daily for one to two weeks. Spray (1%): Apply twice daily for one week.

**Children:**  Use in children is generally limited to those 12 years and older, and the dosage is generally the same as for adults.  Always consult a pediatrician before using terbinafine on a child.  Specific instructions for pediatric use will vary depending on the infection and the doctor's recommendation.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and limited to the application site.  These may include:

* Burning sensation
* Contact dermatitis
* Skin exfoliation
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin irritation
* Rash
* Stinging
* Dry skin (xeroderma)

Less common but more serious side effects are rare with topical application due to low systemic absorption. However, if you experience any unusual symptoms, stop using the medication and consult a doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal. It works by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme crucial for fungal cell membrane synthesis.  By blocking this enzyme, terbinafine disrupts the production of ergosterol, a vital component of the fungal cell membrane.  This disruption leads to fungal cell death and ultimately clears the infection.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Do not use terbinafine if you have a known allergy to terbinafine or any ingredients in the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Terbinafine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. While systemic absorption is low with topical use, it's recommended that breastfeeding mothers avoid applying terbinafine to the breast area and keep infants away from treated skin.  Consult your doctor before using terbinafine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Local Irritation:**  Terbinafine can cause skin irritation in some individuals.  If significant irritation occurs, discontinue use and consult a doctor.
* **Other Medications:**  There are no known significant interactions with other drugs when using topical terbinafine. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are currently taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: Improvement is usually seen within a week, but treatment should continue as directed by your doctor, even if symptoms improve.
* **Q: Can I use terbinafine on my face?** A:  Generally, it's not recommended for facial use unless specifically directed by a doctor, as the face is more sensitive.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember, but do not double the dose. Continue with your regular schedule.
* **Q: How should I store terbinafine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I use terbinafine if I have other skin conditions?** A:  Consult your doctor.  The presence of other skin conditions may affect the use of terbinafine.
