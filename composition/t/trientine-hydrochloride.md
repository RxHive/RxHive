# Trientine Hydrochloride

**Generic Name:** Trientine Hydrochloride

**Usage:**

Trientine hydrochloride is used to treat Wilson's disease.  Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the body, damaging the liver, brain, and other organs. Trientine works by helping the body excrete excess copper in the urine.  It is not a cure for Wilson's disease, but it helps manage the symptoms and prevent further damage.  It's typically used long-term as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that might include dietary modifications and other medications.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of trientine hydrochloride can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation.  These are often dose-related and may lessen over time.
* **Neurological symptoms:**  Headache, dizziness, fatigue, paresthesia (numbness or tingling).
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching.
* **Other side effects:**  Metallic taste in the mouth, increased frequency of urination.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage):**  This is a rare but serious risk, especially with high doses or impaired kidney function. Regular monitoring of kidney function is essential.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Allergic reactions, ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis.
* **Bone marrow suppression:** This is rare.


**How it Works:**

Trientine hydrochloride is a chelating agent.  This means it binds to copper ions in the body, forming a complex that is then excreted in the urine.  By removing excess copper, it prevents the toxic buildup that characterizes Wilson's disease and reduces the damage to organs.  It works differently from other copper-chelating agents like penicillamine, having a different binding mechanism.

* **Q: How is trientine hydrochloride monitored?** A:  Regular monitoring of blood copper levels, liver function tests, and kidney function tests are crucial to assess the effectiveness of treatment and detect potential side effects, especially kidney damage.
