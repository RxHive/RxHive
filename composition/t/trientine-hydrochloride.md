# Trientine Hydrochloride
### Generic Name
Trientine Hydrochloride

### Usage
Trientine hydrochloride is primarily used to treat Wilson's disease.  Wilson's disease is a rare inherited disorder that causes copper to build up in the liver, brain, and other organs. This buildup can lead to serious health problems, including liver damage (cirrhosis), neurological issues (tremors, speech difficulties, and psychiatric symptoms), and even death.  Trientine works by binding to copper in the body and helping to eliminate it through the urine. This helps to reduce the toxic levels of copper and prevent further damage to organs.  While its primary use is for Wilson's disease, it may sometimes be considered in cases of copper overload from other causes, though this is less common and requires careful medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage of trientine hydrochloride is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the severity of their Wilson's disease. It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.  There's no standard pediatric dosage readily available in published guidelines; dosage is determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician managing the child's Wilson's disease.

**Oral Administration (typically tablets):**  The usual adult starting dose is often in the range of 500mg to 1500mg per day, divided into multiple doses. The dosage is adjusted based on the patient's response and copper levels.  Higher doses may be used, particularly in the initial phase of treatment. This needs careful monitoring of blood tests to ensure the correct balance of copper removal and minimal side effects.

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:**  Trientine is not typically administered intravenously.  Oral administration is the standard route.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of trientine hydrochloride can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash

Less common, but more serious side effects, warranting immediate medical attention, include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* Severe kidney problems
* Liver damage (worsening of existing liver disease)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Trientine hydrochloride works by chelating (binding to) copper ions.  Copper is an essential trace mineral, but excess copper is toxic. Trientine effectively binds to the excess copper, preventing its absorption and facilitating its excretion in the urine.  This process helps reduce the harmful accumulation of copper in the body's tissues and organs, thereby alleviating the symptoms and preventing further damage associated with Wilson's disease.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Trientine should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug.  Caution is necessary in individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver disease, requiring careful monitoring of organ function.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Trientine can interact with other medications, including some antacids and other medications affecting the kidneys or liver. Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of trientine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a physician, considering the potential risks and benefits to both the mother and the child.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and require close monitoring.
* **Children:**  As mentioned previously, pediatric dosage requires careful and individualized management by a specialist.

Before starting treatment with trientine hydrochloride, it is essential to discuss any pre-existing health conditions, medications, and allergies with your doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take trientine hydrochloride?** A: Treatment with trientine is typically lifelong to manage Wilson's disease effectively and prevent long-term complications.  The duration and specifics will be determined by your physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: How should I store trientine hydrochloride?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and light, as directed on the prescription label.

* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions while taking trientine?** A: Your doctor may recommend a diet low in copper, but this needs to be discussed and properly planned with a dietician to avoid nutritional deficiencies.

* **Q: Can I stop taking trientine suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping trientine abruptly can lead to a worsening of Wilson's disease symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.  Any changes in dosage must be discussed with your physician.
