# Tranexamic Acid + L Glutathione Reduced + L Ascorbic acid
### Generic Name
Tranexamic Acid + L-Glutathione Reduced + L-Ascorbic Acid


**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-approved pharmaceutical formulation.  It represents a combination of three individual ingredients often used in skincare and sometimes in intravenous (IV) therapies under medical supervision.  The information below describes each component individually and their potential combined effects, but does *not* constitute medical advice.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using any combination of medications or supplements.


### Usage

This combination of ingredients is primarily promoted for its potential effects on skin health and lightening. Let's break down the individual uses:

* **Tranexamic Acid:** This is primarily used to reduce excessive bleeding, often post-surgery or in cases of heavy menstrual bleeding.  In skincare, it's used to help reduce hyperpigmentation (dark spots) by inhibiting the breakdown of plasmin, an enzyme involved in melanin production.

* **L-Glutathione Reduced:** A potent antioxidant, it's believed to help lighten skin by inhibiting melanin production.  It also plays a role in supporting the immune system and liver function.  

* **L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C):**  A powerful antioxidant, it protects the skin from damage caused by free radicals. It also plays a crucial role in collagen synthesis, contributing to skin firmness and reducing the appearance of wrinkles.  It's also often included in skin lightening formulations.


The combined use aims to leverage the synergistic effects of these ingredients for skin brightening and overall improved skin health.  However, scientific evidence supporting the combined effectiveness of this specific triple combination for skin lightening is limited.


### Dosage

There's no established standard dosage for this combined formulation, as it's not a regulated pharmaceutical product.  Dosages for each component vary greatly depending on the intended use and the form of administration (oral, topical, IV).  **Dosage information must be obtained from a qualified medical professional.** This is critical because improper dosages can lead to adverse effects.

* **Tranexamic Acid:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the indication (bleeding vs. skin lightening).  Oral and IV doses are prescribed by a doctor.
* **L-Glutathione Reduced:** Oral supplements typically range from 500mg to 1000mg daily, but this can vary. IV dosages are strictly determined by a medical professional.
* **L-Ascorbic Acid:**  Oral dosages range widely, from a few hundred milligrams to several grams daily (depending on the formulation and health goals), while topical concentrations vary based on the product.


### Side Effects

The side effects listed below are possible for each ingredient individually, and the risk of side effects with the combined use is not well-established.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any adverse effects:


**Tranexamic Acid:**

* Common:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness.
* Less Common but Serious:  Blood clots (rare but serious), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).


**L-Glutathione Reduced:**

* Common: Nausea, diarrhea, upset stomach.
* Less Common:  Skin reactions, headache, fatigue.


**L-Ascorbic Acid:**

* Common: Nausea, stomach upset, diarrhea.
* Less Common:  Headache, insomnia, kidney stones (with high doses).


### How it Works

* **Tranexamic Acid:** Works by inhibiting the activity of plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down blood clots and is involved in melanin production. This reduces bleeding and potentially lightens skin.

* **L-Glutathione Reduced:** Acts as a potent antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals that can damage skin cells and contribute to hyperpigmentation. It also directly inhibits melanin production.

* **L-Ascorbic Acid:** A powerful antioxidant that protects against free radical damage and plays a vital role in collagen synthesis, essential for skin health and elasticity.  It also has some melanin-inhibiting effects.


The combined effects are believed to be synergistic, meaning they work together to enhance the skin-lightening and antioxidant effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Allergies:**  Individuals with allergies to any of these components should avoid them.
* **Kidney Disease:**  High doses of Vitamin C and Tranexamic Acid may pose risks for those with kidney problems.
