# Tazobactam
### Generic Name
Tazobactam

### Usage

Tazobactam is not used as a standalone antibiotic.  It's always administered in combination with piperacillin, a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic. This combination, known as piperacillin/tazobactam, is primarily used to treat serious bacterial infections affecting various parts of the body.  These infections can include:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen, such as peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen) and infections following abdominal surgery.
* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Severe pneumonia, lung abscesses, and other infections affecting the lungs and airways, especially those caused by bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Severe skin infections like cellulitis (bacterial infection of the skin and tissues) and abscesses.
* **Gynecological infections:** Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and other serious infections of the female reproductive organs.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infections):**  A life-threatening condition where bacteria spread through the bloodstream.
* **Bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis):**  Serious infections of the bones and joints.
* **Bacterial endocarditis:** Infection of the inner lining of the heart.


While primarily used for serious infections, piperacillin/tazobactam may also be considered for treating less severe infections in cases where other antibiotics have proven ineffective.  The specific use will always be determined by a physician based on the type of infection, the severity, and the patient's overall health.


### Dosage

Dosage of piperacillin/tazobactam is determined by the healthcare provider based on several factors, including the severity of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage precisely.  Common forms include intravenous (IV) injection and infusion.  There is no standard pediatric or adult dosage; this is determined by the doctor. The medication is usually given every 6-8 hours.  Specific dosage instructions will be provided by a doctor or pharmacist.  Do not attempt to self-adjust dosage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of piperacillin/tazobactam include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Rash
* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness at the injection site)

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis—a life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a severe type of diarrhea caused by bacteria)
* Liver problems (jaundice, elevated liver enzymes)
* Kidney problems
* Seizures


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Piperacillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  This prevents bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, leading to bacterial death.  However, many bacteria produce beta-lactamases—enzymes that break down penicillin antibiotics, rendering them ineffective.  Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  It works by binding to and inactivating these beta-lactamases, protecting piperacillin from degradation and allowing it to effectively kill bacteria.  The combination's effectiveness lies in this synergistic action of piperacillin's antibacterial effect and tazobactam's beta-lactamase inhibition.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with known allergies to penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics should not use piperacillin/tazobactam.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Piperacillin/tazobactam can interact with several other drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.  See the "Interactions" section for a list of drugs that can have adverse effects when used with this medicine.
* **Kidney Problems:**  Individuals with kidney problems may require dosage adjustments.  Kidney function should be monitored during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Bleeding Disorders:**  Piperacillin/tazobactam can affect blood clotting; use caution if you have a bleeding disorder.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking piperacillin/tazobactam when I feel better?**  A: No. Continue taking the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. Stopping prematurely can lead to recurrence of the infection and development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: How should I store piperacillin/tazobactam?** A: Follow your pharmacist's instructions for storage.  Generally, medications should be stored as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.


* **Q:  Is piperacillin/tazobactam safe for children?** A:  Piperacillin/tazobactam can be used in children, but the dosage and safety will need to be carefully assessed by a pediatrician.
