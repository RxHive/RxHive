# Tiotropium Bromide
### Generic Name
Tiotropium Bromide

### Usage
Tiotropium bromide is a long-acting anticholinergic medication primarily used for the long-term maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This means it helps to keep the airways open and prevent breathing difficulties in individuals with COPD.  It's also used to reduce the frequency of COPD exacerbations (flare-ups).  Additionally, tiotropium bromide is approved for the long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 12 years and older.  It's important to note that it's not a rescue medication for sudden breathing problems; those require a different type of inhaler.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the formulation and the condition being treated.

* **COPD:**
    * **Dry powder inhaler (capsule):** 18 mcg (two inhalations from one capsule) once daily.
    * **Soft-mist inhaler (inhalation solution):**  2 inhalations (2.5 mcg/actuation) once daily.

* **Asthma:**
    * **Soft-mist inhaler (inhalation solution):** 2 inhalations (1.25 mcg/actuation) once daily.  The maximum daily dose is 2 inhalations.

**Children (Asthma):**

* **Maintenance treatment (6 years and older):** 2 inhalations (1.25 mcg/actuation) once daily using the soft-mist inhaler.  The maximum daily dose is 2 inhalations.
* **Severely uncontrolled asthma or acute exacerbation (6 years and older):** 2 inhalations (2.5 mcg/actuation) once daily, *in addition* to other asthma medications as directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is usually needed for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. For those with moderate-to-severe renal (kidney) impairment (creatinine clearance â‰¤ 60 mL/min),  no dosage adjustment is necessary, but close monitoring for anticholinergic side effects is crucial.


**Administration:** Always follow the specific instructions provided with your prescription and by your healthcare provider regarding the use of the inhaler.  The inhaler type will influence how the medication is administered.  Improper use can significantly reduce effectiveness.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Sinusitis
* Upper respiratory tract infection


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or glaucoma
* Urinary retention
* Allergic reactions (including angioedema)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Constipation

If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they're severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Tiotropium bromide is an anticholinergic drug. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the muscles in the airways to constrict.  By blocking acetylcholine, tiotropium bromide helps to relax these muscles, widening the airways and making it easier to breathe.  This bronchodilating effect is long-lasting, providing relief for extended periods with once-daily dosing.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tiotropium bromide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tiotropium bromide, atropine, or related compounds, or any component of the formulation.  It's also contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins and those with lactose allergy (for some formulations).
* **Interactions:** Tiotropium bromide may interact with other medications, particularly other anticholinergic drugs. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tiotropium bromide is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The decision to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, carefully weighing the potential benefits against the risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in patients with angle-closure glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), bladder neck obstruction, and moderate-to-severe renal impairment.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid getting tiotropium bromide in your eyes, as it can cause pupil dilation and blurred vision.  This medication is not for immediate relief of acute breathing problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use tiotropium bromide for immediate relief of breathing difficulties?**  A: No, tiotropium bromide is a maintenance medication, not a rescue inhaler. For immediate relief, you'll need a different medication like a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler (e.g., albuterol).

* **Q: How should I store tiotropium bromide?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking tiotropium bromide suddenly?** A: No, it's important to follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping the medication.  Sudden discontinuation may not be advised.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
