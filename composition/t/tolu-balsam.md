# Tolu Balsam
### Generic Name
Tolu Balsam

### Usage
Tolu balsam, a resin obtained from the *Myroxylon balsamum* tree, is primarily used for its flavoring properties in cough mixtures and syrups.  While it possesses mild antiseptic and expectorant actions, these effects are not its primary medicinal purpose.  It's employed to alleviate symptoms associated with coughs, bronchitis, and conditions involving swollen airways.  Additionally, it finds application as a topical skin protectant, applied directly to minor wounds, cracked skin (like nipples or lips), and bedsores to aid in healing and protect the affected area.  Its use as a primary treatment for these conditions is limited, and it is often a component of more complex formulations.

### Dosage
Dosage of tolu balsam varies significantly depending on the formulation and the intended use.  There's no standardized dosage for the raw balsam itself for internal or external use.  Instead, the dosage is determined by the concentration of tolu balsam in a particular cough syrup or topical preparation.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label, or as directed by a healthcare professional. For children, pediatric formulations are available, with dosages adjusted based on age and weight. These should be prescribed and supervised by a doctor or other qualified healthcare provider.  The use of tolu balsam in its pure form for internal or external use is not recommended without professional medical guidance.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and uncommon when tolu balsam is used as a flavoring agent in standard dosages within cough preparations.  Serious side effects are rare. However, allergic reactions, such as skin rashes or itching, are possible, especially with topical application.  If any adverse reactions occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.

*   Mild allergic reactions (rash, itching)
*   Gastrointestinal upset (rare)


### How it Works
Tolu balsam's expectorant action may help to loosen and thin mucus in the respiratory tract, facilitating easier expectoration. Its mild antiseptic properties contribute to a limited antimicrobial effect. As a topical application, it forms a protective barrier over the skin, shielding it from further irritation and promoting healing. The exact mechanisms are not fully elucidated, but its effects are generally attributed to the various components within the resin.
