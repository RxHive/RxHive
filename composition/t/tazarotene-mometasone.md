# Tazarotene + Mometasone
### Generic Name
Tazarotene + Mometasone

### Usage
Tazarotene and Mometasone is a combination topical medication used primarily to treat plaque psoriasis.  This combination therapy leverages the strengths of both components: tazarotene, a retinoid, and mometasone, a corticosteroid.  Tazarotene helps to reduce the rapid skin cell turnover characteristic of psoriasis, while mometasone reduces inflammation and itching.  While primarily used for plaque psoriasis, it may sometimes be considered for other inflammatory skin conditions under strict medical supervision, though this is not a common or standard application.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is for topical use only and should never be ingested.

### Dosage
Dosage instructions will always be provided by a prescribing physician and should be followed precisely.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.  The typical application involves a thin layer applied to the affected areas once daily, usually in the evening. The specific amount to use will depend on the size of the affected area.

* **Adults:**  A thin film is applied once daily to the affected areas.  The physician will determine the appropriate duration of treatment.
* **Children:** The use of this combination medication in children is not typically recommended due to potential risks associated with topical corticosteroids.  If considered necessary, it must be under strict medical supervision with careful monitoring for potential side effects.
* **Oral or IV Administration:**  This medication is for topical use only. It is not administered orally or intravenously.

### Side Effects
Common side effects often seen with tazarotene/mometasone cream are typically mild and localized to the application site. These can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* Dryness or peeling of the skin.
* Erythema (redness).
* Itching.

Less common, but more serious side effects, which necessitate immediate medical attention, may include:

* Severe skin irritation or allergic reactions.
* Worsening of pre-existing skin conditions.
* Signs of systemic corticosteroid effects (although rare with topical application).  These may include weight gain, mood changes, or increased blood sugar.

If any concerning side effects develop, discontinue use and contact a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
This combination medication works synergistically.  Tazarotene, a retinoid, regulates cell growth and differentiation, slowing down the rapid skin cell production that contributes to plaque psoriasis.  Mometasone, a potent corticosteroid, reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response in the skin, thus decreasing itching, redness, and scaling.  By combining these actions, the medication addresses both the inflammatory and proliferative aspects of psoriasis.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used on individuals with a known hypersensitivity to either tazarotene or mometasone or any of the inactive ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although rare with topical application, interactions with other medications are possible. Inform your physician of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of this combination therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered under the strict guidance of a physician, carefully weighing the potential benefits against the risks.
* **Children:** Use in children is generally not recommended due to potential side effects associated with topical corticosteroids.
* **Sun Sensitivity:**  Tazarotene can increase sun sensitivity.  Avoid prolonged sun exposure and use sunscreen with a high SPF while using this medication.  This is particularly important during initial treatment.
* **Avoid Eyes and Mucous Membranes:**  Accidental contact with eyes or mucous membranes should be avoided. Rinse thoroughly with water if contact occurs.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A:  Improvement may be seen within a few weeks, but consistent use and adherence to the prescribed regimen is crucial.  The full therapeutic effect may take several weeks or longer.
* **Q: Can I use this medication on my face?** A: Generally, no. This medication is usually not recommended for facial use unless specifically prescribed by a dermatologist due to increased risk of irritation.
