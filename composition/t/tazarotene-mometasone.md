# Tazarotene + Mometasone

**Generic Name:** Tazarotene/Mometasone furoate


**Usage:**  Tazarotene/Mometasone furoate is a combination topical medication used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It's a prescription-only medicine.  It's applied topically to the affected skin areas.  The specific application schedule and duration will be determined by a dermatologist.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual, but common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, redness, itching, dryness, scaling, irritation, peeling, folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles).  These are usually mild to moderate and temporary.
* **Systemic (less common):** While rare, absorption of the medication through the skin can lead to more systemic side effects.  These are less likely with topical application but could include things like adrenal suppression (especially with prolonged use or large surface area treatment) and elevated blood sugar.  


**How it Works:** This combination medication works by targeting different aspects of psoriasis:

* **Tazarotene:**  A retinoid (vitamin A derivative). It works by reducing inflammation and scaling associated with psoriasis. It regulates cell growth and turnover in the skin, helping to normalize the thickened, scaly patches characteristic of psoriasis.
* **Mometasone furoate:** A corticosteroid (a potent anti-inflammatory steroid). It reduces inflammation, itching, and redness associated with psoriasis by suppressing the body's immune response in the affected area.


The combination of tazarotene and mometasone provides a synergistic effect, meaning they work better together than each individually to control psoriasis symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  Improvement may be seen within a few weeks, but consistent use is crucial.  The full therapeutic effect may take several weeks or even months.
* **How often should I apply it?**  Follow your dermatologist's instructions precisely. The application frequency is typically once daily, usually at bedtime.
* **Can I use this on my face?**  Generally, no. This combination is typically not recommended for the face or other sensitive areas unless specifically prescribed by a dermatologist due to the potential for irritation.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Apply the medication as soon as you remember, but do not apply a double dose to compensate for a missed one.
* **Can I use other topical medications with this?**  Talk to your dermatologist before using other topical medications, especially other steroids or retinoids, to avoid potential interactions and adverse effects.
* **What are the long-term effects?**  Prolonged use of potent corticosteroids like mometasone can lead to skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), and other side effects.  Your dermatologist will monitor your treatment and adjust it as needed.
* **Is it safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor or dermatologist before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **What if I experience severe side effects?**  Stop using the medication and contact your dermatologist or doctor immediately if you experience any severe or unusual side effects.
