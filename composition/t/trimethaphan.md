# Trimethaphan
### Generic Name
Trimethaphan

### Usage

Trimethaphan is a powerful medication primarily used to induce controlled hypotension during surgical procedures.  This controlled lowering of blood pressure can improve the surgical field's visibility, reduce bleeding, and make certain operations easier to perform.  It's also employed in managing hypertensive crises—severe, life-threatening elevations in blood pressure—where rapid blood pressure reduction is crucial.  It's important to note that trimethaphan is administered intravenously (IV) and is generally used only in hospital settings under close medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Controlled Hypotension during Surgery (IV):** The initial dose typically ranges from 3-4 mg/minute.  The dosage is meticulously adjusted according to the patient's response and the desired level of blood pressure reduction.  Maintenance doses can vary significantly, ranging from 0.3 to 6 mg/minute.  It's crucial to discontinue the infusion well before the end of the surgery to allow blood pressure to return to normal levels to prevent complications.

* **Hypertensive Emergency (IV):** The initial dose in hypertensive crises is usually lower, around 0.5-1 mg/minute.  Similar to surgical use, the dose is carefully adjusted based on the patient's response, with maintenance doses ranging from 1-5 mg/minute.  Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is essential during administration.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage in children and adolescents for hypertensive emergencies is significantly lower than in adults.  The initial IV dose is typically 0.05-0.15 mg/minute, adjusted according to the individual response.  Precise pediatric dosing requires careful monitoring and expertise from a qualified healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised in such cases, and close monitoring is necessary.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Angina (chest pain)
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up)
* Itching
* Urticaria (hives)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Loss of appetite (anorexia)
* Constipation
* Paralytic ileus (intestinal blockage)
* Impotence
* Urinary retention
* Blurred vision (cycloplegia)
* Dilated pupils (mydriasis)

Less common but serious side effects can occur. If you experience any unusual symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.  These can include severe allergic reactions or other life-threatening complications.

### How it Works

Trimethaphan functions as a ganglionic blocker.  It works by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses in the autonomic ganglia—the nerve clusters that control involuntary functions such as blood pressure and heart rate.  By inhibiting the action of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) at nicotinic receptors in these ganglia, trimethaphan reduces sympathetic nervous system activity, leading to decreased blood pressure.  Additionally, it may cause direct peripheral vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and release histamine, further contributing to its hypotensive effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Trimethaphan is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, anemia, asphyxia (lack of oxygen), uncorrected respiratory insufficiency, hypovolemia (low blood volume), neonates at risk for paralytic or meconium ileus (bowel obstruction), and shock.

* **Interactions:** The hypotensive effects of trimethaphan may be enhanced by other medications, such as tizanidine.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal or genitourinary obstruction, degenerative CNS disorders, Addison's disease, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, chronic pyelonephritis, arteriosclerosis, asthma, coronary artery disease, in elderly or debilitated patients, patients with hypersensitivity to histamine, liver disease, prostatic hypertrophy, or renal impairment.


* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Trimethaphan is categorized as a pregnancy category D drug, meaning it poses a potential risk to the fetus.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, and its use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended.
