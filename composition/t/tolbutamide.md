# Tolbutamide
### Generic Name
Tolbutamide

### Usage
Tolbutamide is a sulfonylurea drug primarily used as an adjunct to diet in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's crucial to understand that it's not a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and newer, safer sulfonylureas are generally preferred.  Tolbutamide works by stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin.  While it was once more widely used, its efficacy and safety profile have been largely surpassed by other antidiabetic medications.  Therefore, its current use is limited and should only be considered under specific circumstances and with careful medical supervision.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):** Tolbutamide is usually administered orally. The initial dose typically ranges from 1 to 2 grams once daily, taken in the morning or divided throughout the day.  The maintenance dose can vary from 0.25 to 3 grams daily, though doses exceeding 2 grams per day are rarely necessary. Divided doses can sometimes improve gastrointestinal tolerability.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of tolbutamide in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However, it's recommended to use conservative initial and maintenance doses and closely monitor blood glucose levels in patients with either condition. Tolbutamide is not significantly dialyzable.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Tolbutamide can include:

* Headache
* Skin rashes (erythema, maculopapular rash, morbilliform rash, pruritus, urticaria)
* Photosensitivity
* Disulfiram-like reactions (interaction with alcohol)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Epigastric fullness (upper abdominal discomfort)
* Heartburn
* Nausea
* Altered taste

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Pancytopenia (deficiency of all blood cell types)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Cholestatic jaundice (liver disorder)
* Hepatic porphyria (liver disorder)
* Porphyria cutanea tarda (skin disorder)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Agranulocytosis (severe lack of white blood cells)
* Aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure)
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Tolbutamide is a first-generation sulfonylurea that lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta cells in the pancreas. This effect is particularly pronounced in patients with some remaining pancreatic beta-cell function.  While the primary action is insulin release, it may also have other, less well-understood effects on glucose metabolism.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Tolbutamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to tolbutamide, sulfonylureas, or any formulation component; diabetic ketoacidosis (with or without coma); and type 1 diabetes.
* **Interactions:** Tolbutamide can interact with numerous medications, including but not limited to: ACE inhibitors, antibacterial drugs (quinolones and sulfonamides), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, cyclic antidepressants, alcohol, CYP2C9 inducers and inhibitors, estrogens, fibric acid derivatives, GLP-1 agonists, other hypoglycemic drugs, loop diuretics, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues, MAO inhibitors, NSAIDs, phenothiazines, salicylates, SSRIs, sympathomimetics, thiazide/non-thiazide diuretics, thyroid drugs, and vitamin K antagonists.  These interactions can either enhance or reduce the hypoglycemic effect of tolbutamide. Careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments are necessary when co-administering tolbutamide with other medications.
* **Warnings:** Tolbutamide increases the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and cardiovascular mortality. Patients with G6PD deficiency should use tolbutamide cautiously.  It's categorized as Pregnancy Category C; its use during pregnancy should be avoided, and it should be discontinued at least two weeks before the expected delivery date.  Tolbutamide is excreted in breast milk, so it's not recommended for breastfeeding mothers.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Tolbutamide?** A: Store Tolbutamide as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Tolbutamide?** A: No, alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking tolbutamide, as it can increase the risk of disulfiram-like reactions and potentiate the hypoglycemic effects, leading to severe hypoglycemia.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Contact your physician regarding any dose missed concerns.

* **Q:  Why is Tolbutamide not as commonly prescribed as other diabetes medications?** A: Newer sulfonylureas and other antidiabetic medications offer improved efficacy and a better safety profile.  Tolbutamide is associated with a higher risk of side effects and is thus rarely the preferred treatment option.
