# Terizidone
### Generic Name
Terizidone

### Usage
Terizidone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic primarily used as a second-line treatment for tuberculosis (TB), both pulmonary (affecting the lungs) and extrapulmonary (affecting other parts of the body). It's particularly valuable in cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), where the bacteria have developed resistance to first-line antibiotics.  Terizidone is classified as a category IV antitubercular drug.  It's a structural analog of cycloserine, meaning it shares a similar molecular structure and mechanism of action.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Pulmonary or Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis:** The typical oral dose is 10-15 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 1000 mg/day.  This is usually divided into two doses (500-750 mg twice daily) but may be given once daily if tolerated.  It's crucial to take pyridoxine (vitamin B6) concurrently, at a dose of at least 100 mg (or 50 mg for every 250 mg of Terizidone) to mitigate potential neurological side effects. The treatment duration is determined by several factors, including the patient's response to treatment, culture results, and the specific treatment regimen.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Pulmonary or Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis:** The usual oral dose is 10-20 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses given every 12 hours. The maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.  Concurrent pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is essential, with dosage proportionate to the child's weight (1-2 mg/kg/day, typically 10-50 mg/day). For children weighing 23-30 kg, a common recommendation is 250 mg (one capsule) twice daily.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for liver impairment, so close monitoring for toxicity is essential.
* **Renal Impairment:** For individuals with creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 30 ml/min or those on hemodialysis, the recommended dose is 250 mg once daily, or 500 mg three times per week, administered after dialysis.
* **Toxicity Management:** Some patients may require alternate-day dosing (250 mg one day, 500 mg the next) to minimize toxicity.


### Side Effects

* Major and minor clonic seizures, convulsions, coma, paresis (partial paralysis), hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes), disorientation, memory loss, psychoses, suicidal tendencies, aggression, personality changes, paresthesia (numbness or tingling), and peripheral neuropathy.
* Rash
* Lichenoid eruptions
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. Consult a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Terizidone inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by competitively inhibiting two essential enzymes: L-alanine racemase and D-alanine ligase.  By interfering with these enzymes, Terizidone prevents the formation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall.  This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Terizidone, cycloserine, or any formulation component.
* Epilepsy
* Psychiatric diseases (e.g., depression, severe anxiety, psychosis)
* Concurrent alcohol use
* Severe cerebral sclerosis
* Severe renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥2 mg/dL)
* Infections with *Mycobacterium bovis* BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin)

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of CNS depression.
* Use with caution in patients with renal failure.
* Pregnancy Category is unknown; use only when clearly needed and no suitable alternatives exist.
* Excreted in breast milk; however, no adverse effects have been observed in breastfed infants.


### Interactions

Concurrent use of Terizidone with ethionamide, isoniazid, or alcohol can worsen Terizidone's neurotoxicity.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Terizidone with food?** A: It's best to take Terizidone on an empty stomach; however it can be taken with orange juice. High-fat meals can reduce its absorption, so avoid these.
* **Q: How should I store Terizidone?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you're uncertain.
* **Q: Are there any specific precautions for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: Use during pregnancy is only advised when the benefits outweigh the risks, and there are no safer alternatives. It's excreted in breast milk, but adverse effects in infants haven't been reported. Consult your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. Some side effects are serious and require prompt medical attention.
