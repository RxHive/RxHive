# Temocillin
### Generic Name
Temocillin

### Usage
Temocillin is a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin antibiotic primarily used to treat severe bacterial infections caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria.  Its main applications include:

*   **Septicemia (bloodstream infection):** Temocillin is effective against several bacteria that can cause life-threatening bloodstream infections.
*   **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** It's used to treat UTIs caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria.
*   **Lower respiratory tract infections:** Temocillin can be used to treat infections of the lungs and airways caused by specific bacteria.

It's crucial to understand that temocillin's effectiveness depends on the specific bacteria causing the infection.  A doctor will conduct tests to determine susceptibility before prescribing this medication.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

The dosage of temocillin varies depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's renal function.  Generally:

*   **Septicemia, UTIs, Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (IM/IV intermittent infusion):** 4g per day divided into two doses.  Critically ill patients may receive 6g per day in three divided doses.
*   **Septicemia, UTIs, Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (IV continuous infusion):** A loading dose of 2g is followed by either 4g/day or 6g/day for critically ill patients.

**Children:**

The safety and efficacy of temocillin in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments for Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment is necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (reduced creatinine clearance, CrCl).  The adjustments are as follows:

*   CrCl >60 mL/min: No adjustment needed.
*   CrCl 30-60 mL/min: 1g every 12 hours (IM/IV).
*   CrCl 10-30 mL/min: 1g every 24 hours (IM/IV).
*   CrCl <10 mL/min: 500mg to 1g every 24-48 hours (IM/IV).
*   Hemodialysis (non-daily): 2g every 48 hours or 3g every 72 hours after dialysis (IV).
*   Hemodialysis (daily): 1g after each dialysis (IV).
*   Continuous peritoneal dialysis: 1g every 24 hours (IM).

**Administration:**

*   **IM (Intramuscular):** Administer immediately after reconstitution.
*   **IV (Intravenous):** Continuous infusion should be administered at a rate of 2 mL/hour over 24 hours following a loading dose. Intermittent infusions should be given slowly over 30-40 minutes.  Bolus injections should be given over 3-4 minutes.

Precise dosage and administration should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual patient needs.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Pain at the injection site
*   Diarrhea
*   Skin rash (urticarial or erythematous)
*   Fever

Less common, but serious side effects, especially in patients with renal impairment receiving high doses, may include:

*   Neurological signs and symptoms
*   Seizures
*   Phlebitis/Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the vein)
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
*   Arthralgia (joint pain)
*   Myalgia (muscle pain)

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Temocillin is a penicillin antibiotic that works by interfering with the bacterial cell wall's synthesis.  It binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), crucial enzymes involved in constructing the bacterial cell wall.  By inhibiting these proteins, temocillin prevents the bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, ultimately leading to their death.  Importantly, temocillin is resistant to beta-lactamases, enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down penicillin antibiotics, making it effective against bacteria that would normally resist other penicillins.


### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Temocillin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to penicillins, other beta-lactams (e.g., cephalosporins), or any component of the formulation.  A history of allergic reaction to cephalosporins increases the risk of a reaction to temocillin.
*   **Renal Impairment:**  Careful monitoring and dosage adjustment are essential in patients with reduced kidney function.
*   **Seizure Disorder:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of temocillin during pregnancy is unknown.  It's excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Temocillin may interact with several other medications, including aminoglycosides, probenecid, methotrexate, and anticoagulants.  Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I store temocillin?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, it should be stored at a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking temocillin if I feel better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if you feel better, to ensure the infection is fully eradicated and prevent potential recurrence or resistance.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Never double the dose.

*   **Q:  Is temocillin safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use isn't typically recommended.  The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your individual condition.
