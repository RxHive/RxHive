# Ticagrelor + Aspirin

**Generic Name:** Ticagrelor + Aspirin (combination product; individual generic names are Ticagrelor and Aspirin)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to prevent blood clots in patients who have recently had a heart attack (myocardial infarction), are experiencing unstable angina (chest pain), or have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) such as stenting.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *prescribed by a doctor* and the dosage and duration are determined based on individual patient needs and medical history.  It's never to be started or stopped without a physician's guidance.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects of Ticagrelor + Aspirin can vary depending on the individual, but common ones include:

* **Bleeding:** This is a significant risk, ranging from minor nosebleeds to serious internal bleeding.  Bruising, bleeding gums, and blood in the urine or stool should be reported immediately to a doctor.
* **Dyspnea (shortness of breath):**  This is a relatively common side effect.
* **Headache:**  A frequent side effect.
* **Diarrhea:** Can occur in some patients.
* **Nausea:** Another possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:** May be experienced by some patients.
* **Purpura (purple skin discoloration):**  A less common but serious side effect.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though rare, allergic reactions can occur.  Symptoms might include rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.


This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  Always consult the patient information leaflet provided with your medication or your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list.


**How it Works:**  Ticagrelor and Aspirin both work to prevent blood clots by inhibiting platelet aggregation (the clumping of platelets).  Platelets are essential for blood clotting, but excessive clotting can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

* **Ticagrelor:** This is a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor.  It blocks the action of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), a substance that promotes platelet aggregation.  This significantly reduces the risk of blood clots forming.

* **Aspirin:** This is an antiplatelet medication that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1), an enzyme involved in platelet activation.  This also reduces platelet aggregation and further decreases the risk of blood clots.


The combination of these two drugs provides a more robust antiplatelet effect than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Ticagrelor + Aspirin with other medications?**  This should be discussed with your doctor or pharmacist. Interactions with other drugs, particularly those affecting blood clotting, are possible.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

* **How long will I need to take this medication?** The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to the therapy.

* **What are the signs of bleeding?** Any unusual bleeding, such as easy bruising, nosebleeds, blood in urine or stool, or prolonged bleeding from cuts should be reported to your doctor immediately.

* **Is there a risk of stomach upset?**  Aspirin can cause stomach upset in some individuals. Your doctor may recommend taking it with food or a gastroprotective agent.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided, as it can increase the risk of bleeding.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
