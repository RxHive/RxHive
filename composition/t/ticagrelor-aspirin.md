# Ticagrelor + Aspirin
### Generic Name
Ticagrelor + Aspirin (Combination)

**Note:**  Ticagrelor and aspirin are often used together, but aren't typically found as a single, pre-combined pill.  This information refers to the *concurrent* use of these two medications, as prescribed by a physician.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.


### Usage

This combination of ticagrelor and aspirin is primarily used to prevent blood clots (thrombosis) in patients who have recently experienced a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or unstable angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart).  It's also used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a procedure to open blocked coronary arteries.  

Ticagrelor works by preventing platelets from sticking together, thus reducing the risk of clot formation. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation, but through a different mechanism.  The combination provides a more potent antiplatelet effect than either drug alone.


### Dosage

Dosage must be determined and prescribed by a physician and will vary depending on the individual patient and their specific medical condition.  There is no standard "over-the-counter" combination.

* **Ticagrelor:**  The typical starting dose is 90 mg twice daily for the first three days, followed by 90 mg once daily.  Dosage adjustments are not usually made based on age or weight unless there are specific contraindications. IV administration is not typically used for ticagrelor.

* **Aspirin:** The typical dosage is 75-100 mg once daily. The exact dose will depend on individual risk factors and physician assessment. Again, adjustment based on age or weight may be necessary in certain patients.


**Important:**  Never start or stop taking either medication without consulting your doctor.  The specific dosage of both ticagrelor and aspirin must be determined by your healthcare provider, and should not be self-adjusted.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Ticagrelor):**

* Bleeding (nosebleeds, bruising, gum bleeding)
* Diarrhea
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Dizziness
* Headache

**Common Side Effects (Aspirin):**

* Upset stomach
* Heartburn
* Nausea


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Both Medications):**

* **Serious bleeding:** This can be internal or external and may be life-threatening.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience heavy bleeding, prolonged bleeding from cuts, black or bloody stools, or unexplained bruising.
* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis (life-threatening).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Ticagrelor blocks the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation.  Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme involved in thromboxane A2 synthesis, which is crucial for platelet activation.  By acting through different mechanisms, the combined effect of ticagrelor and aspirin significantly reduces the risk of blood clot formation.


### Precautions

* **Bleeding Risk:**  Both ticagrelor and aspirin increase the risk of bleeding.  Patients with a history of bleeding disorders, peptic ulcers, or other conditions that increase bleeding risk should be carefully monitored.
* **Drug Interactions:**  These medications can interact with other drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of ticagrelor during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered by the prescribing physician, weighing the benefits against the potential risks.  Aspirin should also be used cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly bleeding.  Careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking these medications on my own?**  A: No.  Stopping either medication abruptly can increase the risk of blood clots.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store these medications?** A: Store ticagrelor and aspirin as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q:  Are there any foods or drinks I should avoid while taking these medications?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet is always beneficial.  Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided as it can increase the risk of bleeding.

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to therapy.
