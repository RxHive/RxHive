# Tryptophan
### Generic Name
Tryptophan

### Usage
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid used primarily as an adjunct in the treatment of depressive disorders, such as bipolar affective disorder.  It's not a standalone treatment for depression but rather works alongside other antidepressants to potentially enhance their effectiveness.  It's important to note that the use of tryptophan in this context is not universally accepted or supported by all medical professionals, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in depression management.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (for depressive disorders):** The typical oral dose is 8-12 grams per day, divided into 3-4 doses.  This is always used *in conjunction with* other prescribed antidepressant medications, never alone.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of tryptophan in children have not been established. It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using tryptophan if you have liver or kidney disease.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Nausea
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Disinhibition (changes in behavior, potentially including sexual disinhibition)
* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, agitation, muscle rigidity, and rapid heart rate).  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect serotonin syndrome.


### How it Works
Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, feelings of well-being, and happiness. By increasing the availability of tryptophan, the body may be able to produce more serotonin, potentially leading to improved mood in individuals with depressive disorders.  However, the exact mechanisms and effectiveness of tryptophan in this context require further research.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Tryptophan is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to tryptophan or any component of the formulation.

**Increased Risk:**  Use of tryptophan may increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions, central nervous system (CNS) depression, susceptibility to cataract formation, and potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome, especially when combined with certain medications (see Interactions below).

**Use with Caution:**  Tryptophan should be used cautiously in patients with achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid), a history of diabetes, or those who are protein-deprived.

**Drug Interactions:** Tryptophan can interact with several medications, particularly those that also affect serotonin levels (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)). This can significantly increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.  Examples include citalopram, desvenlafaxine, isocarboxazid, linezolid, and methylene blue.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of tryptophan during pregnancy and lactation have not been established.  It should be avoided during these periods unless specifically advised by a doctor.


### FAQs
**Q: Can I take tryptophan without a doctor's prescription?**
A: While tryptophan is available as a supplement, it's crucial to consult a doctor before using it, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.  Improper use can lead to serious complications.

**Q: How should I store tryptophan?**
A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the product label. Generally, it's best to store it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Is tryptophan safe for long-term use?**
A: The long-term safety of tryptophan is not fully established.  Long-term use should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Stop taking tryptophan and contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
