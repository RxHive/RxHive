# Ticlopidine
### Generic Name
Ticlopidine

### Usage

Ticlopidine is an antiplatelet medication primarily used to prevent blood clots.  Its main applications include:

* **Prevention of stroke:** While largely replaced by newer medications like clopidogrel, ticlopidine was previously used to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence in individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).  **It's crucial to note that ticlopidine is no longer a first-line treatment for stroke prevention due to safety concerns.**

* **Coronary artery disease:** Ticlopidine helps prevent blood clots in the arteries of the heart, potentially reducing the risk of angina (chest pain) and myocardial infarction (heart attack).

* **Peripheral artery disease (PAD):** It can improve blood flow and alleviate symptoms like pain, coldness, and ulceration in the limbs caused by PAD.

* **Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH):** Following surgery for SAH, ticlopidine may help improve blood circulation by reducing cerebral vasospasm (narrowing of blood vessels in the brain).

* **Thromboembolism prevention in vascular surgery:** In patients undergoing vascular surgery with extracorporeal circulation, ticlopidine can help prevent blood clots.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's overall health.  **Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your healthcare professional.**  The information below is for general reference only and should not be considered medical advice.

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**

* **Coronary Artery Disease:** Typically 250 mg twice daily.
* **Peripheral Artery Disease:** Usually 300-600 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses.
* **Stroke Prevention:**  Previously 250 mg twice daily, but this is no longer recommended due to safety concerns.
* **Post-SAH:**  Often 300 mg daily, divided into 3 doses.
* **Vascular Surgery:**  Generally 200-300 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of ticlopidine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney impairment.  Severe liver impairment is a contraindication for ticlopidine use.  Consult a doctor for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea
* Increased serum triglyceride levels and hyperlipidemia

**Less Common but Significant Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Gastrointestinal pain
* Flatulence
* Vomiting
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Purpura (purple spots on the skin)
* Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (Occurring in <1% of patients):**

* Agranulocytosis (severe deficiency of white blood cells)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure)
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) â€“ a life-threatening blood disorder
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)
* Other serious hematological (blood), hepatic (liver), and dermatological (skin) effects

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Ticlopidine needs to be converted into an active metabolite in the body to work effectively. This active form blocks the P2Y12 receptors on platelets, which are blood cells essential for clotting. By blocking these receptors, ticlopidine prevents platelet activation and aggregation (clumping together), thereby reducing the risk of blood clot formation. The effect lasts for the lifespan of the affected platelets.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ticlopidine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it, active bleeding (e.g., peptic ulcer bleeding), severe liver impairment,  hematological disorders (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, history of TTP or aplastic anemia), and hemostatic disorders.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ticlopidine can interact with several drugs, including cimetidine, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, oral anticoagulants, theophylline, phenytoin, and bupropion.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Bleeding Risk:** Ticlopidine increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid activities that could lead to injury while taking this medication.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ticlopidine is a category B drug in pregnancy, meaning animal studies haven't shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  The risk to the nursing infant is unknown. Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.

* **Elderly and Vulnerable Populations:**  Close monitoring is especially important for elderly patients and those with existing health conditions, including liver or kidney disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for ticlopidine to work?** A: The full effect may take several days or weeks to develop.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ticlopidine suddenly?** A: No, always follow your doctor's instructions on stopping the medication.  Sudden cessation could increase the risk of blood clot formation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store ticlopidine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  Are there any foods or drinks I should avoid while taking ticlopidine?** A:  No specific dietary restrictions are typically associated with ticlopidine, but maintaining a healthy diet is generally advisable.

* **Q:  Is ticlopidine safe for everyone?** A: No, it has several contraindications and potential side effects. It is crucial to consult a physician to determine if it's appropriate for you.  This medication should be used only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.
