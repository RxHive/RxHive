# Tenoxicam

**Generic Name:** Tenoxicam

**Usage:**  Tenoxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It's primarily used to reduce pain, inflammation, and stiffness associated with these conditions.  It is *not* typically used for acute pain relief like a headache or injury.  Dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  Like all NSAIDs, tenoxicam can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  These can range from mild to severe and include:

* **Common:**  Upset stomach, heartburn, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Fluid retention (edema), high blood pressure, increased risk of bleeding (especially gastrointestinal bleeding), kidney problems, liver problems, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use or high doses).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), serious gastrointestinal ulcers or perforation.


**How it Works:** Tenoxicam works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, tenoxicam helps to alleviate the symptoms of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.  It is thought to be more potent than some other NSAIDS.

**FAQs:**

* **Is tenoxicam available over-the-counter (OTC)?** No, tenoxicam is a prescription medication.
* **Can I take tenoxicam with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking before starting tenoxicam.  Interactions can occur, especially with other NSAIDs, blood thinners, and certain heart medications.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The onset of pain relief varies, but it generally takes several days for the full therapeutic effect to become apparent.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **What are the long-term risks of taking tenoxicam?**  Long-term use of tenoxicam increases the risk of serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding, kidney problems, heart attack, and stroke. Regular monitoring by a doctor is essential.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking tenoxicam?** Alcohol can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.  It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking tenoxicam.
* **Who should not take tenoxicam?**  People with known allergies to tenoxicam or other NSAIDs, severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcers, or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding should not take this medication.  Pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding should discuss its use with their doctor.
