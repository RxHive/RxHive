# Tenoxicam
### Generic Name
Tenoxicam

### Usage
Tenoxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the symptoms of various inflammatory conditions and pain.  Its main applications include:

* **Osteoarthritis (OA):**  Reduces pain and inflammation in joints affected by osteoarthritis.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  Helps manage pain and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
* **Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA):**  Used in children aged 2 years and older to treat the symptoms of JRA.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:**  Provides symptomatic relief for this inflammatory spinal condition.
* **Extra-articular inflammation:**  Effective in managing inflammation in tissues outside the joints, such as tendinitis, bursitis, and periarthritis (inflammation of the shoulder or hip joints).
* **Acute gout flares:**  Helps alleviate the intense pain and inflammation during gout attacks.
* **Postoperative pain:**  Used to manage pain following surgical procedures.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the condition and route of administration.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Oral:** For osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and extra-articular inflammation, the typical dose is 10-20 mg once daily. Higher doses may increase side effects without significantly improving benefits.
* **Intramuscular (IM) or Intravenous (IV):** For pain and inflammation (including acute gout flares and postoperative pain), an initial dose of 20-40 mg may be given IM or IV for 1-2 days, followed by oral administration.

**Pediatric Dosage (Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis):** For children aged 2 years and older, the oral dosage is typically 0.125 mg/kg once daily, up to a maximum of 7.5 mg.  The dosage should be adjusted based on the child's weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) and renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly defined in all manufacturer's labeling.  Use with caution, and always consult a doctor for guidance, especially in cases of severe impairment.  Kidney guidelines may recommend discontinuation or avoidance of use based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Edema (swelling)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Tenoxicam is a non-selective NSAID, meaning it inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, tenoxicam alleviates symptoms associated with inflammatory conditions and pain. Additional mechanisms, such as effects on cell activity and cytokine levels, may also contribute to its anti-inflammatory action.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Tenoxicam should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to tenoxicam or other NSAIDs, active peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases, or a history of asthma, urticaria, or rhinitis triggered by aspirin or other NSAIDs.  Preoperative/preanesthesia use should be avoided in elderly patients or those with increased risk of renal failure or bleeding.
* **Interactions:** Tenoxicam can interact with several medications, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, diuretics, lithium, methotrexate, other NSAIDs, and quinolone antibiotics.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions before starting tenoxicam.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, hematologic disorders, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or mixed connective tissue disease.  Elderly and debilitated patients may be at increased risk of side effects.  Avoid use during the third trimester of pregnancy.  The safety of tenoxicam during breastfeeding is not fully established.


### FAQs
