# Thrombin, Human
### Generic Name
Thrombin, Human

### Usage
Thrombin, human, is a hemostatic agent.  Its primary use is to help control bleeding from capillaries and small venules when standard surgical techniques are insufficient or impractical. This typically involves situations where oozing or minor bleeding is present and accessible for topical application.  It's used as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, standard surgical techniques for hemostasis.

### Dosage
**Control of Hemorrhage (Topical Application):**

* **Frozen Solution:**  The available presentations are 2 mL, 5 mL, or 20 mL vials, each containing 800-1200 IU/mL of thrombin.  Up to 10 mL can be applied directly to the bleeding tissue.  This may be used with or without an absorbable gelatin sponge. The exact amount needed depends on the bleeding area and application method.

* **Adults and Children:** The dosage is the same for both adults and children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects
* **Common (<1%):** Pruritus (itching)

* **More Frequent (â‰¥2%):** Increased INR (international normalized ratio), decreased lymphocyte count, increased neutrophil count, increased partial thromboplastin time, and increased prothrombin time.  These indicate potential effects on blood clotting.

* **Serious but Less Common:** Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) is rare but possible.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Thrombin is a protein that directly converts fibrinogen (a blood protein) into fibrin. Fibrin is the essential component of blood clots. By directly catalyzing this conversion, thrombin promotes rapid clot formation and helps stop bleeding.  It acts locally at the site of application, without requiring other clotting factors.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to human blood products or a history of anaphylaxis to them.
* Severe or brisk arterial bleeding.
* Direct circulatory injection (this can lead to extensive intravascular clotting and even death).

**Warnings and Increased Risk:**

* Transmission of infectious agents (viruses, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease).  Because it's derived from pooled human plasma, there's an inherent, albeit low, risk.
* Systemic absorption (absorption into the bloodstream) should be minimized, as it could lead to unwanted clotting effects elsewhere in the body.
* Potential for thrombosis (blood clot formation).  Careful monitoring is crucial.


**Additional Precautions:**  Do not inject thrombin; it is for topical use only.  The bleeding area should be cleaned of blood before application (suction or gentle blotting), but do not wipe aggressively.  Once applied, avoid disturbing the forming clot.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I use thrombin on deep wounds?** A: No, thrombin is intended for superficial bleeding from capillaries and small venules.  It is not effective for deep wounds or arterial bleeding.

* **Q: How should I store thrombin?** A: Store as directed by the manufacturer's labeling, typically frozen to maintain stability.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: No significant drug interactions are currently known, but always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.

* **Q: Is thrombin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Thrombin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are unknown. The excretion in breast milk is also unknown.  Discuss its use with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Q: What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Symptoms of an allergic reaction might include rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.
