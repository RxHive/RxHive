# Tolfenamic Acid
### Generic Name
Tolfenamic Acid

### Usage

Tolfenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches.  It's specifically designed to alleviate the pain and other symptoms associated with migraine attacks.  While its primary use is for migraine, it's important to note that tolfenamic acid is not a preventative medication for migraines; it's used only to treat individual attacks as they occur.  The use of tolfenamic acid for other inflammatory conditions is generally not recommended due to its potential side effects and the availability of safer alternatives for those conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Migraine):** The typical adult dose is 200 mg taken orally at the very first sign of a migraine. If symptoms don't improve sufficiently within 1-2 hours, a second 200 mg dose may be taken.  Exceeding a total of 400 mg in a 24-hour period is not recommended.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of tolfenamic acid in children have not been established, so it should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Tolfenamic acid should be used with extreme caution, or avoided altogether, in individuals with mild to moderate hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  In cases of severe hepatic or renal impairment, tolfenamic acid is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used).  Specific dosage adjustments for these conditions are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling.  Always consult a doctor before using tolfenamic acid if you have any liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Constipation
*   Abdominal pain
*   Dizziness
*   Drowsiness
*   Headache

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

*   Allergic reactions (ranging from rash to severe anaphylaxis)
*   Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation (ulcers)
*   Liver damage (hepatitis)
*   Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity)
*   Blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia)
*   Central nervous system effects (confusion, hallucinations)
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking tolfenamic acid and contact a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Tolfenamic acid works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, substances in the body that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever.  By reducing the levels of these substances, tolfenamic acid helps to alleviate the pain and other symptoms associated with migraine headaches.  The exact mechanism by which it alleviates migraine pain is not fully understood, but its impact on inflammation and pain signaling pathways is a key element.


### Precautions

*   **Allergic Reactions:** Tolfenamic acid is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to it or other NSAIDs.  Those with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (aspirin triad) are at increased risk of severe allergic reactions.

*   **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Tolfenamic acid can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and perforation, particularly in individuals with a history of such problems.  Use with caution in patients with pre-existing GI issues.

*   **Cardiovascular Risk:**  Like other NSAIDs, tolfenamic acid may increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, especially with long-term use or high doses.

*   **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Tolfenamic acid can impair kidney and liver function, especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions.  Careful monitoring is necessary, and use should be avoided or approached cautiously in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.

*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tolfenamic acid is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.  Use during the first and second trimesters should only be considered after carefully weighing the benefits and risks with a doctor. It's also excreted in breast milk, making it unsuitable for use during breastfeeding.

*   **Drug Interactions:**  Tolfenamic acid can interact with many other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), corticosteroids, and other NSAIDs, increasing the risk of bleeding. It may also interact with other medications impacting kidney function, blood pressure, or lithium levels.  It is essential to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting tolfenamic acid.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take tolfenamic acid with other pain relievers?** A: No, it is best to avoid combining tolfenamic acid with other pain relievers without first consulting a doctor. Many medications interact negatively.


*   **Q: How should I store tolfenamic acid?** A: Store tolfenamic acid in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and out of reach of children.


*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking tolfenamic acid?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking tolfenamic acid, as alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects.


*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose of tolfenamic acid, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double up on doses.


*   **Q: How long can I take tolfenamic acid?** A: Tolfenamic acid is for acute migraine treatment, not long-term use.  Do not take it for longer than recommended by your doctor.  If migraines persist, consult your doctor for a long-term management plan.
