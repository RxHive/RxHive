# Teprotumumab
### Generic Name
Teprotumumab

### Usage
Teprotumumab is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with moderate to severe thyroid eye disease (TED).  TED is a condition where the tissues and muscles around the eyes become inflamed, leading to symptoms like bulging eyes (proptosis), double vision (diplopia), and eye pain.  Teprotumumab's primary use is to reduce the severity of these symptoms and improve vision.  It is currently not approved for other conditions.


### Dosage
Teprotumumab is administered intravenously (IV). The typical dosage for adults with TED is 10 mg/kg of body weight as a single dose, followed by 20 mg/kg every three weeks for a total of eight infusions.  

**Important Considerations:** If an infusion-related reaction occurs during a previous dose, subsequent infusions should be administered at a slower rate, and premedication with antihistamines, antipyretics (fever reducers), and/or corticosteroids might be considered.  There is no established dosage for children, and Teprotumumab's safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.  Dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in current prescribing information.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Muscle spasms

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Headache
* Hearing impairment
* Infusion-related reactions (such as increased blood pressure, feeling hot, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly serious ones, or any other concerning symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Teprotumumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by binding to and blocking the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R).  While the exact mechanism in TED isn't fully understood, this action is believed to reduce inflammation and help improve the symptoms associated with the disease.  By inhibiting IGF-1R signaling, it helps to lessen the inflammation and tissue changes characteristic of TED.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Teprotumumab may harm a developing fetus. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using this medication.  The excretion of Teprotumumab in breast milk is unknown.
* **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):** Patients with pre-existing IBD may have an increased risk of IBD exacerbation. Careful monitoring is crucial for these individuals.
* **Infusion Reactions:**  Infusion-related reactions are possible. Healthcare providers closely monitor patients during infusions.  
* **Other Medications:**  Currently, no specific drug interactions have been identified; however, as with all medications, inform your physician of any other prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal medications being taken.
* **Diabetes:** Patients with diabetes need close monitoring of their blood glucose levels, as Teprotumumab may raise blood sugar.
