# Trifluridine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Trifluridine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Trifluridine ophthalmic solution is primarily used to treat primary keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent epithelial keratitis caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2.  These are viral infections affecting the cornea (the clear front part of the eye) and conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye).  The medication is specifically targeted at these viral infections and aims to reduce inflammation and promote healing.  While not its primary indication, it may be used off-label in some cases of acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus infection, particularly in patients with HIV.  However, this is an alternative treatment and should only be considered under the strict guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

**Herpes Keratoconjunctivitis/Keratitis:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥6 years:** For the treatment of herpes keratoconjunctivitis and keratitis, the recommended dosage is one drop of 1% trifluridine ophthalmic solution into the affected eye(s) every two hours while awake, up to a maximum of nine drops per day. This frequency continues until the corneal ulcer heals (re-epithelialization).  After re-epithelialization, the dosage is reduced to one drop every four hours while awake for another seven days (a minimum of five drops per day is recommended).  Treatment should not exceed 21 days. If there is no improvement after 7-14 days, alternative therapy should be considered.

**Off-label Use (Acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous herpes simplex):**

* **Adults with HIV:**  The dosage may be different and will be determined by the physician.  A typical regimen might involve applying the 1% solution three times daily (TID) for at least 21 to 28 days, depending on the clinical response.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, adjustments may not be necessary due to the low systemic absorption of the ophthalmic formulation.  Always follow your physician's instructions.


### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Burning sensation, stinging of the eyes, eyelid edema (swelling).
* **Less Common (frequency not defined):** Local ocular hypersensitivity reactions, dry eye syndrome, epithelial keratopathy (damage to the corneal epithelium), eye irritation, hyperemia (redness), increased intraocular pressure, ocular stromal edema (swelling of the corneal stroma), and superficial punctate keratitis (inflammation of the cornea).

**Important Note:**  Any significant or persistent side effects should be reported to your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Trifluridine ophthalmic solution is a nucleoside analog that inhibits viral replication.  It works by interfering with the synthesis of viral DNA.  Specifically, it inhibits thymidylate synthetase, an enzyme crucial for viral DNA production.  Furthermore, trifluridine can be incorporated into the viral DNA in place of thymidine, further disrupting the virus's ability to replicate and spread. This mechanism effectively targets and combats the herpes simplex virus.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** Trifluridine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to trifluridine or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** Prolonged use (more than 21 days) may increase the risk of ocular toxicity.  Mild local irritation is also possible.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Trifluridine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  While systemic absorption is low after topical application, the minimum effective dose should be used during pregnancy, along with punctal occlusion (closing the tear duct) to minimize fetal exposure.  The information on use during lactation is limited.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies.  Potential interactions should be evaluated.
* **General Precautions:**  Always wash your hands before and after instituting the eye drops.  Avoid touching the tip of the bottle to any surface, including the eye or skin.  Apply gentle pressure to the lacrimal sac (located at the inner corner of the eye) for about one minute after instillation or instruct the patient to gently close their eyelid, to minimize systemic absorption.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Improvement may be seen within 7-14 days, but this varies depending on the severity of the infection.  Continue using the medication as directed even if you feel better.
* **Q: Can I use this medication with contact lenses?** A:  No. Contact lenses should be removed before instillation and not reinserted for at least 15 minutes afterward.
* **Q: How should I store Trifluridine ophthalmic solution?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep the bottle tightly closed.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Instill the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is nearly time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I use Trifluridine ophthalmic solution for other types of eye infections?** A: No, Trifluridine is specifically for herpes simplex virus infections of the cornea and conjunctiva.  Do not use it for other eye conditions without consulting a doctor.
