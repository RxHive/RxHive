# Taliglucerase Alfa
### Generic Name
Taliglucerase Alfa

### Usage

Taliglucerase alfa is a prescription medicine used as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for adults and children with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 (non-neuropathic) Gaucher disease.  Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder resulting in a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This deficiency leads to a buildup of glucocerebroside, a fatty substance, in various organs, particularly the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.  The accumulation causes significant health problems, including an enlarged spleen and liver (hepatosplenomegaly), anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), bone pain, and skeletal abnormalities. Taliglucerase alfa works by replacing the missing enzyme, helping to break down the accumulated glucocerebroside and alleviate the symptoms of Gaucher disease.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following dosage information is for general understanding only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  

**Adults with Gaucher Disease (Intravenous Infusion):**

* The usual dose is 60 units/kg administered every two weeks as a 60-120 minute intravenous infusion.
* The dosage is individualized based on the severity of the disease.
* Infusion should begin at a rate of 1.2 mL/min, potentially increasing to a maximum of 2.2 mL/min based on patient tolerance. The total infusion volume must be delivered over at least 60 minutes.
* For patients switching from imiglucerase, the starting dose of taliglucerase alfa should be the same (in units/kg) as their previous imiglucerase dose.
* Dosage adjustments are determined by monitoring the patient's response and achieving/maintaining therapeutic goals.  Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may be considered to prevent infusion reactions in patients who have experienced them previously.

**Children with Gaucher Disease (Intravenous Infusion):**

* The safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa haven't been established in children under 4 years old.
* For children aged 4 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.
* Infusion should begin at a rate of 1 mL/min, potentially increasing to a maximum of 2 mL/min based on patient tolerance.  The total infusion volume must be delivered over at least 60 minutes.

**Dosage Adjustments for Hepatic or Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Antibody formation
* Arthralgia (joint pain) and limb pain
* Vomiting (in pediatric patients)

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or less frequently):**

* Flushing
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Pruritus (itching)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling under the skin)

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or unexpected ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Taliglucerase alfa is a recombinant form of the human enzyme glucocerebrosidase.  In Gaucher disease, this enzyme is deficient or absent. Taliglucerase alfa replaces the missing enzyme, enabling the body to break down glucocerebroside, a fatty substance that accumulates in organs and tissues. By reducing the buildup of glucocerebroside, taliglucerase alfa helps alleviate the symptoms and complications of Gaucher disease.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Taliglucerase alfa is contraindicated in patients with a severe hypersensitivity to taliglucerase alfa or any component of its formulation.
* **Hypersensitivity/Allergic Reactions:**  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Patients should be carefully monitored during and after infusions.
* **Antibody Formation:** Antibody formation against taliglucerase alfa can occur.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Taliglucerase alfa is a Category B drug during pregnancy.  While it's not known whether it's excreted in breast milk, caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Dizziness and fatigue are potential side effects; avoid activities requiring alertness if experiencing these symptoms.
* **Patients with Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Taliglucerase alfa should be used cautiously in patients who have previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions.


### FAQs
