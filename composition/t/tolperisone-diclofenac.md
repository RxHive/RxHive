# Tolperisone + Diclofenac

**Generic Name:** Tolperisone + Diclofenac

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and muscle spasms.  It's often prescribed for musculoskeletal conditions characterized by both pain and muscle stiffness or spasm, such as:

* Low back pain
* Cervical spondylosis (neck pain)
* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Muscle strains and sprains
* Post-surgical pain and inflammation


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, ulceration (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, fatigue, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased heart rate (tachycardia), palpitations (rare).
* **Skin:** Rash, itching.
* **Hepatic:**  Elevated liver enzymes (rare but important to monitor).
* **Other:**  Fluid retention, blurred vision.

**Serious side effects are rare but require immediate medical attention.  These include:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, severe liver damage.

**How it Works:**  This combination medication works through two distinct mechanisms:

* **Tolperisone:** Acts as a muscle relaxant. It works centrally in the spinal cord to reduce muscle spasm and stiffness by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses.
* **Diclofenac:** Acts as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.

By combining these two actions, the medication aims to provide comprehensive relief from both the pain and the muscle spasms associated with musculoskeletal conditions.
