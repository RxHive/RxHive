# Tirbanibulin
### Generic Name
Tirbanibulin

### Usage
Tirbanibulin is a topical medication primarily used to treat actinic keratosis (AK) on the face and scalp.  Actinic keratosis are rough, scaly patches of skin that are precancerous lesions caused by sun exposure.  Tirbanibulin is currently approved only for this specific indication.  It is not a treatment for other skin conditions or types of skin cancer.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Actinic Keratosis):**  The usual dosage is a thin layer of 1% tirbanibulin ointment applied once daily (OD) to the affected area. The treatment area should not exceed 25 square centimeters, and no more than one single-dose packet should be used per application.  This treatment should continue for five consecutive days.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of tirbanibulin in children have not been established. It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  However,  patients with severe liver or kidney disease should be monitored closely for any adverse reactions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) often include:

* Crusted skin
* Erythema (redness) of the skin
* Skin exfoliation (peeling)
* Skin swelling

Less common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) include:

* Dermal ulcers (sores)
* Pustules (pus-filled bumps)
* Skin erosion
* Skin vesicles (blisters)
* Application site pain
* Application site itching (pruritus)


Serious side effects are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.  Any worsening of skin reactions, or the development of new or unusual symptoms, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Tirbanibulin is a microtubule inhibitor. Microtubules are essential components of cells, playing a role in cell division and other cellular processes. Tirbanibulin disrupts the formation and function of microtubules, interfering with the growth and survival of abnormal skin cells associated with actinic keratosis.  Additionally, it affects Src kinase signaling, a pathway often overactive in AK. By targeting these cellular processes, tirbanibulin helps to eliminate the precancerous skin lesions.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Currently, no specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer. However, caution is advised.
* **Increased Risk:** Tirbanibulin may increase the risk of dermatologic (skin) reactions and ocular (eye) effects.
* **Application:** Apply only to the keratotic lesions. Avoid applying near the eyes, mouth, or lips. Do not cover with an occlusive dressing. Wash hands immediately after application. Avoid washing the treated area for approximately 8 hours after application. After this time, the area may be washed with mild soap and water.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of tirbanibulin during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
