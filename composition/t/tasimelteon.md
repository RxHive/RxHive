# Tasimelteon
### Generic Name
Tasimelteon

### Usage
Tasimelteon is primarily used to treat Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (Non-24) in adults.  Non-24 is a sleep disorder where the body's natural sleep-wake cycle becomes misaligned with the external day-night cycle, often leading to significant sleep disturbances.  It's also approved to treat nighttime sleep disturbances in individuals with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting sleep patterns,  in patients aged 3 years and older.  The dosage form (capsule vs. oral suspension) differs based on age.

### Dosage

**Adults (capsules):**

* **Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder:** 20 mg orally once daily (OD), 1 hour before bedtime.  The capsule should be taken at the same time each night.  It's important to note that effects may not be seen for several weeks or months.
* **Nighttime sleep disturbances in Smith-Magenis syndrome:** 20 mg orally once daily (OD), 1 hour before bedtime. Capsules should be taken at the same time each night.


**Children (oral suspension):**

* **Nighttime sleep disturbances in Smith-Magenis syndrome (ages 3-15 years):**
    * Weight ≤ 28 kg: 0.7 mg/kg/dose OD, 1 hour before bedtime.
    * Weight > 28 kg: 20 mg OD, 1 hour before bedtime.

**Adolescents (≥16 years):**  Use the adult capsule formulation (20mg OD, 1 hour before bedtime).

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild or moderate impairment.  Use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.


**Important Note:** The capsule and oral suspension formulations are not interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Abnormal dreams/nightmares

* Urinary tract infection


Serious side effects are less frequent but should be reported to a doctor immediately.  If any unusual or concerning side effects occur, consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Tasimelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist.  It works by binding to and activating the MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors in the brain.  While the exact mechanism for its effectiveness in Non-24 and Smith-Magenis syndrome isn't fully understood, it's believed that its interaction with these receptors helps regulate the body's natural sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm).

### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease Tasimelteon's effectiveness.  Concurrent use with certain strong CYP1A2 inhibitors may increase Tasimelteon's exposure and side effects.
* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution in elderly individuals.
* **Neonates (oral suspension):**  Use caution due to the presence of benzyl alcohol in the oral suspension formulation.
* **Alcohol:** Patients should limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking Tasimelteon.
* **Smoking:** Smoking induces CYP1A2, potentially reducing Tasimelteon's effectiveness.
* **Pregnancy:** Tasimelteon is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The decision to use during pregnancy should carefully weigh the benefits and risks.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether Tasimelteon is excreted in breast milk.  Mothers should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor.
* **Driving/Operating Machinery:** Patients should avoid activities requiring mental alertness after taking Tasimelteon, as it may cause drowsiness.
