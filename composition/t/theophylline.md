# Theophylline
### Generic Name
Theophylline

### Usage
Theophylline is primarily used to manage reversible airflow obstruction in conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's a bronchodilator, meaning it helps relax the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  While its primary use is for managing chronic symptoms, it can also be used as an adjunct treatment for acute bronchospasm, often in combination with other medications like beta-agonists and corticosteroids.  This means it's used alongside these other drugs to provide additional relief during a severe breathing episode.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage is highly individualized based on serum theophylline levels and ideal body weight.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Acute Bronchospasm (first-time use within the last 24 hours):**  Oral: A loading dose of 5 mg/kg may be given to achieve a peak serum level of approximately 10 mcg/mL. Subsequent doses are guided by serum levels, safety, and tolerability. IV: A loading dose of 4.6 mg/kg given over 30 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose (starting at 0.4 mg/kg/hr) guided by serum levels and clinical response.

* **Chronic Bronchospasm (Asthma, COPD, Chronic Bronchitis):**  Oral:  Modified-release tablets or capsules are typically prescribed at doses ranging from 250-500 mg twice daily or 400-600 mg once daily. The specific dosage and frequency depend on individual response and serum levels.  Modified-release tablets of theophylline monohydrate usually start at 200 mg every 12 hours, adjustable depending on response.

* **Acute Severe Bronchospasm (Adjunct):** IV administration as an adjunct to other therapies for acute exacerbations.  The loading dose is typically 4.6 mg/kg over 30 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion, starting at 0.4 mg/kg/hr.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage is also highly individualized based on age, weight, and serum theophylline levels.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Chronic Bronchospasm:** Oral modified-release formulations are used, with doses adjusted based on the child's weight and age.  For children 6 years and older, a starting dose is often 9 mg/kg twice daily.  For children 6-12 years weighing 20-35 kg, modified-release tablets or capsules might be prescribed in lower dosages (25-250 mg twice daily). Children over 12 years are often given the same dosage as adults.

* **Acute Severe Bronchospasm:** IV administration with a loading dose of 4.6 mg/kg over 30 minutes.  Maintenance infusion rates vary depending on age and weight; typically higher in younger children.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on factors like liver and kidney function.  Individuals with liver impairment need careful monitoring and potentially reduced doses due to the risk of toxicity.

### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Insomnia
* Restlessness
* Tremor

Less common, but serious side effects:

* Seizures
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Cardiac arrhythmias


**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Theophylline works in two ways: it relaxes the muscles around the airways (bronchodilation) and reduces the airways' response to irritants.  It achieves bronchodilation by inhibiting certain enzymes (phosphodiesterases), leading to increased levels of a compound that helps relax the airway muscles.  Its other effects are related to its influence on other cellular processes that contribute to inflammation and airway reactivity.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Theophylline is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to theophylline or its components, porphyria, recent myocardial infarction, or acute tachyarrhythmia.  It should also be used with caution in combination with ephedrine in young children.

* **Drug Interactions:** Many drugs can interact with theophylline, affecting its metabolism and levels in the body. These include certain antibiotics, antidepressants, and other medications for respiratory conditions.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, the elderly, and individuals with liver or kidney disease require careful monitoring of theophylline levels and may need dose adjustments.


* **Warnings:**  Theophylline toxicity can occur with excessive dosing. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and seizures.  Regular blood tests to monitor theophylline levels are frequently necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Theophylline with other medications?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, as many can interact with theophylline.

* **Q: How should I store Theophylline?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Is Theophylline safe during pregnancy?** A:  Theophylline is a Category C medication during pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been definitively established.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.

* **Q: Can I breastfeed while taking Theophylline?** A: Theophylline passes into breast milk, and there is a potential for irritability in the infant.  Discuss this with your doctor.
