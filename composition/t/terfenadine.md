# Terfenadine

**Generic Name:** Terfenadine

**Usage:**  Terfenadine is an antihistamine that was once used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives).  **However, it is no longer available in most countries due to serious cardiac risks.**  Its use is largely discontinued because of the potential for dangerous heart rhythm problems.

**Side Effects:**  While terfenadine's side effects were generally mild compared to its cardiac risks, they included:

* **Drowsiness:** This was a common side effect.
* **Dry mouth:**  Also relatively common.
* **Headache:**  Another frequently reported side effect.
* **Constipation:** Less common, but possible.
* **Dizziness:** Could occur, especially in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants.
* **Cardiac arrhythmias (Torsades de Pointes):** This is the serious side effect that led to its withdrawal from the market. This life-threatening arrhythmia is especially dangerous when terfenadine is taken with certain medications (see FAQs).

**How it Works:** Terfenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine.  It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes many of the symptoms associated with allergies, such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose.  Unlike some older antihistamines, terfenadine didn't readily cross the blood-brain barrier, thus resulting in less drowsiness. However, its metabolism to a metabolite (fexofenadine) is what caused the cardiotoxicity.


**FAQs:**

* **Why is terfenadine no longer available?**  Due to the risk of a potentially fatal heart rhythm problem called Torsades de Pointes, especially when taken with certain medications that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme (like ketoconazole, erythromycin, and cimetidine), terfenadine was withdrawn from the market.  This enzyme is crucial in its metabolism.  If inhibited, the build-up of the active metabolite can cause this dangerous heart rhythm.

* **What are the safer alternatives to terfenadine?**  Fexofenadine (Allegra) and cetirizine (Zyrtec) are safer and more effective alternatives that don't carry the same cardiac risks.  These are newer-generation antihistamines.  Your doctor can help you determine the best option for you.

* **Can I still get terfenadine?** It is highly unlikely you will find terfenadine available through legitimate pharmaceutical channels in most countries.  Any sources offering it should be viewed with extreme caution.

* **What should I do if I have taken terfenadine and am experiencing heart problems?**  Seek immediate medical attention.  This is a medical emergency.
