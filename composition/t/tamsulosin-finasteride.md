# Tamsulosin + Finasteride
### Generic Name
Tamsulosin + Finasteride (Combination Product)


This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.  A combination product of Tamsulosin and Finasteride is not a standard, widely available formulation.  The information below addresses each drug individually and then touches upon the potential rationale for combining them.  **This is NOT a recommendation to combine these medications without explicit instruction from a physician.**

### Usage

**Tamsulosin:** This alpha-blocker medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as an enlarged prostate.  These symptoms often include difficulty urinating, weak urine stream, frequent urination, especially at night, and a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.

**Finasteride:** This 5α-reductase inhibitor is primarily used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). In BPH, it works by shrinking the prostate gland over time, reducing urinary symptoms. For hair loss, it inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that contributes to hair follicle miniaturization and hair loss.

**Potential for Combination:**  A physician *might* prescribe Tamsulosin and Finasteride together for men with BPH. Tamsulosin provides rapid symptom relief by relaxing the prostate muscles, while Finasteride offers a long-term reduction in prostate size.  However, this combination is not a standard, single-pill formulation and requires taking two separate medications.


### Dosage

**Tamsulosin:** Dosage varies depending on the individual and their condition.  It's typically administered orally, once daily.  A common starting dose is 0.4mg. A doctor may adjust the dose based on response.  IV administration is not typically used for Tamsulosin.  

**Finasteride:**  For BPH, the usual dose is 5mg once daily. For male pattern baldness, a lower dose (1mg) is typically prescribed.  Finasteride is administered orally.  It is not available in an IV formulation.  

**Important Note:**  Dosage and administration should *always* be determined and monitored by a healthcare provider.  Self-adjusting medication can be dangerous.


### Side Effects

**Tamsulosin:**

* Common: Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, drowsiness, runny nose, and decreased libido.
* Less Common but Serious:  Sudden drop in blood pressure (particularly upon standing), fainting, allergic reactions.

**Finasteride:**

* Common: Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorders.
* Less Common but Serious: Gynecomastia (breast enlargement), breast tenderness, and depression.  A very rare but serious side effect is an increased risk of certain cancers.


**Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

**Tamsulosin:**  Relaxes the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing urinary symptoms.  It achieves this by blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.

**Finasteride:** Inhibits the type II 5α-reductase enzyme, which is responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  Lowering DHT levels leads to a decrease in prostate size (in BPH) and slows down hair follicle miniaturization (in male pattern baldness).


### Precautions

**Tamsulosin:**  Caution is advised in patients with a history of hypotension (low blood pressure), syncope (fainting), or certain heart conditions.  It should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney impairment.

**Finasteride:**  Should not be used by women who are or may become pregnant, as it can cause birth defects in male fetuses.  It should be used cautiously in patients with liver impairment.  Patients should be informed about the potential for sexual side effects.

**Both Medications:**  Interactions with other medications are possible.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
