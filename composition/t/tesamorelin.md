# Tesamorelin
### Generic Name
Tesamorelin

### Usage
Tesamorelin is primarily used to reduce excess abdominal fat (visceral fat) in adults with HIV infection who have lipodystrophy. Lipodystrophy is a condition characterized by abnormal fat distribution in the body, often presenting as a loss of fat in the face, arms, and legs, and an accumulation of fat in the abdomen.  Tesamorelin's effect is targeted at reducing this specific abdominal fat accumulation, not overall weight loss.  It's important to note that Tesamorelin does not treat the underlying HIV infection itself.

### Dosage
Tesamorelin is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily.  The exact dosage depends on the vial concentration:

* **1 mg vial:** The dose is 2 mg once daily.
* **2 mg vial:** The dose is 1.4 mg once daily.

The abdomen is the preferred injection site, and injection sites should be rotated within the abdominal area. Avoid injecting into areas with scar tissue, bruises, or the navel.

**Pediatric use:** The safety and effectiveness of Tesamorelin in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for pediatric use due to the potential for excessive growth.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  However, monitoring is crucial.  If there are persistent elevations in Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) levels (generally above 3 standard deviations), or if hypersensitivity symptoms occur, Tesamorelin should be discontinued.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Antibody development (Immunologic)
* Injection site reactions (Local)
* Arthralgia (joint pain) (Neuromuscular and skeletal)

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Hypoesthesia (reduced sense of touch)
* Pain
* Carpal tunnel syndrome (Nervous system)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Palpitations (Cardiovascular)
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Night sweats (Dermatologic)
* Vomiting
* Dyspepsia (indigestion) (Gastrointestinal)
* Diabetes mellitus (new onset or worsening of existing condition)
* Elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level (Hematologic)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (Allergic reactions)
* Limb pain
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Muscle rigidity
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels (an indicator of muscle damage)
* Joint swelling
* Muscle strain (Neuromuscular and skeletal)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Tesamorelin is a growth hormone-releasing factor (GHRF) analog.  It works by binding to specific receptors in the pituitary gland, stimulating the release of endogenous (naturally produced) growth hormone.  Growth hormone then promotes the breakdown of fat, particularly visceral fat (abdominal fat), and has anabolic effects on muscle and bone.  These effects are largely mediated by Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), which is produced in the liver and other tissues in response to growth hormone.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Tesamorelin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to Tesamorelin or any of its components
* A disrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (due to conditions like hypophysectomy, hypopituitarism, pituitary tumors, head irradiation, or head trauma)
* Active malignancy (cancer)
* Pregnancy (Category X)


**Interactions:** Tesamorelin may interact with other medications, particularly those that affect growth hormone levels or hormones involved in glucose metabolism (such as corticosteroids like prednisone and cortisone).  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting Tesamorelin.

**Warnings:**  Tesamorelin carries an increased risk of:

* Fluid retention
* Injection-site reactions
* Elevated IGF-1 levels
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Neoplasms (tumors)
* Glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus
* Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illness


Use caution in patients with a history of non-malignant neoplasms.  Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and IGF-1 is important.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can Tesamorelin help with overall weight loss?** A: No, Tesamorelin is specifically targeted at reducing excess abdominal fat in people with HIV and lipodystrophy. It's not intended for general weight loss.

* **Q: How is Tesamorelin administered?** A: It's injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist; do not double the next dose.

* **Q: How should I store Tesamorelin?** A: Store according to the instructions provided on the medication label, typically refrigerated.

* **Q: Is Tesamorelin safe during pregnancy?** A: No, it is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Q:  How long will it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see results varies, but improvement in abdominal fat reduction is typically observed over the course of several weeks or months of treatment.
