# Tulobuterol
### Generic Name
Tulobuterol

### Usage
Tulobuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist used primarily to treat asthma in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease.  It's also used in the management of bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though its role in these conditions may be secondary to other, more commonly prescribed medications.  It's important to note that for asthma control, tulobuterol, a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA), should always be used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids and not as a standalone treatment.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For asthma, bronchitis, and COPD, the recommended dosage is a transdermal patch of 2mg once daily (OD).

**Children:**  Dosage varies by age:

* **6 months to <3 years:** 0.5mg transdermal patch OD.
* **3 to <9 years:** 1mg transdermal patch OD.
* **â‰¥9 years and adolescents:** Same as adult dose (2mg transdermal patch OD).


**Important Considerations:** The provided dosages are based on the available information and may not encompass all situations.  Always consult a physician or pharmacist for personalized dosage instructions.  They can take into account factors such as the individual's overall health, other medications being taken, and the severity of the condition.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Cardiovascular: Facial flushing, palpitations, chest pain, tachycardia
* Nervous System: Fatigue, headache, insomnia, excitement, numbness
* Dermatologic: Contact dermatitis, erythema, pruritus, urticaria
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Increased thirst, decreased serum potassium
* Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, stomach discomfort, vomiting
* Hematologic & Oncologic: Eosinophilia
* Hepatic: Increased serum ALT and AST levels
* Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactoid reaction
* Local: Application-site pain
* Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Increased creatine phosphokinase, tremor, leg cramps

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Cardiac arrhythmia
* Diarrhea
* Localized warm feeling
* Skin rash

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Tulobuterol works by directly stimulating beta-2 receptors found in the smooth muscles of the airways.  This stimulation activates a cellular pathway (Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA) that ultimately leads to relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscles.  This relaxation reduces airway resistance, making it easier to breathe.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to tulobuterol or any formulation component.
* Concomitant use with catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine, isoproterenol).
* Monotherapy for asthma treatment (must be used with an inhaled corticosteroid).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of skin irritation. Use with caution in patients with atopic dermatitis.
* Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (arrhythmias, heart disease, hypertension), diabetes (may increase blood glucose), or hyperthyroidism (may worsen symptoms).
* Tulobuterol increases the risk of arrhythmia when used with digoxin; concomitant use should be avoided.
* Concomitant use with xanthines, corticosteroids, or diuretics can cause hypokalemia; concomitant use should be avoided.
*  Pregnancy and Lactation:  While LABAs may be used during pregnancy, alternatives to tulobuterol might be preferred.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use tulobuterol for an acute asthma attack?** A: No.  Tulobuterol is a long-acting medication for preventing attacks, not treating acute episodes. Use a short-acting beta-2 agonist (like albuterol) for immediate relief.

* **Q: Can I stop taking my inhaled corticosteroids when I start tulobuterol?** A: No. Tulobuterol is not a replacement for inhaled corticosteroids and should be used *in addition* to them for optimal asthma management.

* **Q: How should I apply the transdermal patch?** A: Apply to clean, dry skin on your chest, back, or upper arm. Avoid broken skin and rotate application sites daily to prevent irritation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the patch as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store tulobuterol?** A: Store according to the instructions on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.
