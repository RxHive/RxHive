# Tixocortol
### Generic Name
Tixocortol

### Usage
Tixocortol is a corticosteroid nasal spray primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with various types of rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal lining).  These include:

* **Seasonal allergic rhinitis:**  Hay fever, caused by an allergic reaction to pollen.
* **Acute and chronic congestive rhinitis:** Inflammation of the nasal lining, often due to infection or irritation.
* **Non-allergic (vasomotor) rhinitis:**  Inflammation of the nasal lining not caused by allergies, often triggered by irritants or changes in weather.

The medication works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages, thus alleviating symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, and itching.


### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults is:

* **Allergic rhinitis and vasomotor rhinitis:** 1-2 sprays in each nostril 2-4 times daily.  This is for the 1% intranasal suspension.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Specific pediatric dosing information isn't provided in the source material; always consult a physician for guidance on children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, though their frequency isn't specified, can include:

* Transient pricking sensation
* Dryness of the nasal mucosa (lining)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Angioedema (swelling under the skin)
* Facial edema (swelling of the face)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Blurred vision
* Local pain (rhinalgia)

While less common, serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or severe reactions.


### How it Works
Tixocortol's mechanism of action involves a combination of effects: anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antiproliferative.  In simpler terms, it reduces inflammation in the nasal passages, suppresses the immune system's overreaction (in the case of allergies), and slows down the growth of cells involved in the inflammatory response. This combined action leads to a reduction in the symptoms of rhinitis.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Tixocortol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to tixocortol or similar corticosteroids, active viral or fungal nasal infections, active local superinfection, or epistaxis (nosebleed).  There is also increased risk if you have ocular disease.
* **Interactions:** Tixocortol may lessen the effectiveness of live vaccines. Concurrent use is not recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of tixocortol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Avoid use during pregnancy, and breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **General Considerations:** Clear nasal passages before using the spray. Treat existing infections before starting tixocortol. Shake the bottle well, prime several times, and blow your nose before each use.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but symptom relief is usually experienced relatively quickly after administration.  However, consistent use is usually necessary for optimal symptom control.

* **Q: Can I use it longer than prescribed?** A:  No.  Long-term use of nasal corticosteroids can have side effects.  Follow your doctorâ€™s instructions regarding duration of use.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Can I use it with other nasal medications?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist. Using multiple nasal medications simultaneously might interfere with each other's effectiveness or cause adverse reactions.
