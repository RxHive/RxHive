# Tetracycline (Topical)
### Generic Name
Tetracycline (Topical)

### Usage
Tetracycline topical is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used primarily to treat acne vulgaris (acne), minor skin infections, and dermal ulcers.  It's effective against a wide range of bacteria commonly causing these conditions.  While primarily used topically, it's important to note that this information focuses solely on its topical application, not systemic use.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children â‰¥8 years:**  For acne, minor skin infections, and dermal ulcers, a 3% tetracycline ointment is typically applied 1-3 times daily to the affected area.  Treatment should continue for at least six weeks, and up to 6 months for acne. If no improvement is seen within two weeks, reassessment by a healthcare professional is recommended.

**Children <8 years:**  Use of tetracyclines should generally be avoided in children under 8 years old due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia.  Only use it if other treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, and under strict medical supervision.  The dosage would be the same as for adults if prescribed.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Allergic skin reactions
* Erythema (redness)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin discoloration
* Skin irritation
* Skin rash

Less common, but more serious, side effects are possible.  If any adverse effects occur, contact a doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Tetracycline works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.  It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit (and possibly the 50S subunit) of susceptible bacteria, preventing them from producing essential proteins necessary for their survival and reproduction. This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death and resolution of the infection.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Tetracycline topical is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline, other tetracycline derivatives, or any formulation components.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  A risk of allergic reactions exists.  Discontinue use and seek medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Superinfection:**  Like all antibiotics, tetracycline can increase the risk of fungal or bacterial superinfection (overgrowth of other microorganisms).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tetracycline topical is categorized as Pregnancy Category D.  While the systemic absorption after topical application is unknown, alternative medications are preferred during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult a doctor.
* **Children:**  As mentioned above, use in children under 8 years old should be avoided due to the risk of tooth discoloration.
* **Other warnings:** Avoid contact with eyes, nose, and mouth.  Do not apply to deep wounds or burns. Tetracycline can stain clothing and skin temporarily.
