# Tobramycin (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Tobramycin (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage

Tobramycin inhalation solution is primarily used to treat lung infections caused by the bacterium *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are 6 years or older.  It's crucial to note that tobramycin only targets *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*; it won't work against other types of bacteria.  While not its primary indication, tobramycin inhalation may be considered in adults with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis experiencing frequent exacerbations requiring antibiotic treatment.  In such cases, it's typically used in addition to other antibiotics given orally or intravenously.  This off-label use should be discussed with a physician.


### Dosage

**Cystic Fibrosis (CF):**

* **Adults and children â‰¥6 years:** The usual dose is 300 mg inhaled every 12 hours (not less than 6 hours apart) for 28 days, followed by a 28-day drug-free period.  This cycle of 28 days on and 28 days off is typically repeated. The medication can be administered as a nebulized solution or via capsules using a specialized inhaler.  If a dose is missed and it's less than 6 hours until the next dose, the missed dose should be skipped.

**Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis (Off-Label Use):**

Dosage varies depending on whether it's for an acute exacerbation or for long-term suppression of infections.  A physician will determine the appropriate dosage and regimen based on the patient's individual needs and response.  Typical dosages may range from 80mg to 300mg twice daily.

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specifically outlined in the manufacturer's labeling.  It is critical to consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in these situations.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Voice disorders
* Headache
* Cough
* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal lining)
* Various pulmonary effects (exacerbations of CF, decreased lung function, etc.)
* Fever

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Chest discomfort
* Skin rash
* Increased blood glucose
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Changes in blood tests (e.g., increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, eosinophilia)
* Muscle pain
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, serious side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), pneumonitis (lung inflammation), and severe hearing loss can occur.  

**Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic.  It works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacterial ribosomes, interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. This ultimately leads to damage to the bacterial cell membrane, disruption of the cell wall, and ultimately, bacterial cell death.  Specifically, it's effective against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Tobramycin should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to tobramycin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
* **Respiratory Issues:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma or bronchospasm, as it may worsen these conditions.
* **Kidney and Hearing Problems:**  Aminoglycosides can be toxic to the kidneys and inner ear.  Patients with pre-existing kidney or hearing problems should be closely monitored.
* **Neuromuscular Disorders:**  Use with caution in individuals with neuromuscular disorders (like myasthenia gravis) as it may exacerbate symptoms.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Some medications, such as loop diuretics and mannitol, can increase the risk of kidney damage when used with tobramycin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While use in pregnancy may be considered for CF management, it's crucial to weigh the benefits against potential risks to the fetus.  The excretion of tobramycin into breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I mix tobramycin with other medications in my nebulizer?** A: No, do not mix tobramycin with other medications in your nebulizer.  Administer bronchodilators first, followed by chest physiotherapy, and then tobramycin.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If it's less than 6 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule.  If more than 6 hours have passed, contact your doctor for guidance.
* **Q: How should I store tobramycin?** A: Store tobramycin as directed on the product label. Usually, this involves storing it at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of tobramycin?** A:  Long-term use of tobramycin can increase the risk of kidney damage and hearing loss. Regular monitoring is essential to detect and manage these potential side effects.
