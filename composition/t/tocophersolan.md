# Tocophersolan
### Generic Name
Tocophersolan

### Usage
Tocophersolan is a synthetic, water-soluble form of vitamin E. Its primary use is in the treatment of congenital chronic cholestasis (CCC) and hereditary chronic cholestasis (HCC) in children.  This condition involves impaired bile flow, leading to liver damage. Tocophersolan's antioxidant properties help protect liver cells from damage caused by free radicals.  While its primary application is in pediatric liver disease,  research suggests potential benefits in other areas, including wound healing and reducing scarring, due to its antioxidant and cell-membrane stabilizing effects. However, these uses are not yet established as standard medical practice.


### Dosage
Dosage for Tocophersolan is primarily determined by body weight and is usually administered orally as a solution.  The typical dosage for children with congenital or hereditary chronic cholestasis is 0.34 mL/kg/day.  Precise instructions should always be obtained from a physician and carefully followed.  There are currently no established dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment based on manufacturer labeling.  Use in preterm infants is contraindicated.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Tocophersolan are not extensively documented in readily available literature.  However, it's important to note that any medication can have potential side effects, and users should report any unusual symptoms to their healthcare provider.  A significant concern is the potential for increased bleeding risk.


### How it Works
Tocophersolan functions as a potent antioxidant.  Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells. Tocophersolan neutralizes these free radicals, protecting cells, particularly liver cells in the case of CCC and HCC, from oxidative stress and the subsequent damage. This antioxidant action helps mitigate the progression of liver disease in affected children. Its mechanism also involves stabilizing cell membranes, further contributing to its protective effect.

### Precautions
Tocophersolan is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components. It's also contraindicated in preterm newborn infants.  Because of the potential for increased bleeding risk, close monitoring, particularly of prothrombin time (a measure of blood clotting ability), might be necessary.  Consult a healthcare professional before using Tocophersolan if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have any other underlying health conditions.  Interactions with other medications are not comprehensively documented; therefore, it is crucial to inform your physician of all medications and supplements you are taking.
