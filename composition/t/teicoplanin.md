# Teicoplanin
### Generic Name
Teicoplanin

### Usage
Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat severe infections caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria.  Its primary use is in treating serious infections such as bone and joint infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, complicated urinary tract infections, community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia, endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream), and peritonitis (infection of the abdominal lining) associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).  Teicoplanin also has a role in treating *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea and colitis.  It's important to note that teicoplanin's effectiveness depends on the susceptibility of the infecting bacteria.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the type and severity of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  The following information is for guidance only; always follow your doctor's or other healthcare provider's specific instructions.  Dosage is typically given intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), though oral administration is possible in certain situations (like *C. difficile* infection).  

**Adults:**

* **Gram-positive infections (general):**  Initial dose of 6-12 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3-5 doses, followed by a maintenance dose of 6-12 mg/kg daily, adjusted to maintain a target trough concentration (the lowest concentration in the blood just before the next dose).
* **Bone and joint infections:** Higher initial dose (12 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3-5 doses), followed by a maintenance dose of 12 mg/kg daily.
* **Complicated skin and soft tissue infections, complicated urinary tract infections, pneumonia:** Lower initial dose (6 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 doses), followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg daily.
* **Endocarditis:** Higher initial dose (12 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3-5 doses), followed by a maintenance dose of 12 mg/kg daily for at least 3 weeks.
* **Peritonitis (CAPD):**  A loading dose followed by administration through the peritoneal dialysis fluid.  Specific concentrations and schedules for peritoneal administration should be determined by the healthcare provider.
* **Surgical prophylaxis (orthopedic):** A single dose of 400 mg or 6 mg/kg given at the start of anesthesia.
* **_Clostridium difficile_ infection:** 100-200 mg twice daily for 7-14 days (oral).

**Children:**  Dosage is adjusted based on weight and age.  Neonates and infants (<2 months) usually receive a different regimen than older children.  Always consult a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare professional for pediatric dosing.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Renal impairment requires dose adjustments to achieve therapeutic trough levels.  Hepatic impairment generally does not require dosage adjustment.  Specific adjustments depend on creatinine clearance (CrCl) and are best determined by a healthcare provider familiar with the patient's condition.

### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Erythema (redness), pruritus (itching), and skin rash
* Pain at the injection site
* Fever

**Less Common, but Serious:**

* Seizures
* Urticaria (hives)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Anaphylactic shock
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Superinfection (new infection caused by different organism)
* Injection-site infection (abscess)
* Muscle rigidity
* Renal failure

Many other rare side effects have been reported. If you experience any adverse effects, including those not listed here, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Specifically, it blocks the formation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall.  Without a properly formed cell wall, bacteria cannot grow and reproduce, leading to their death.  This mechanism of action targets Gram-positive bacteria effectively.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Teicoplanin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to teicoplanin or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Teicoplanin may interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised in patients with kidney problems, as teicoplanin is primarily excreted through the kidneys. Dose adjustments are often necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Teicoplanin should be avoided during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  The excretion of teicoplanin in breast milk is unknown.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to vancomycin may have an increased risk of cross-reactivity with teicoplanin.
* **Infusion Reactions:**  Slow intravenous infusion can minimize infusion-related reactions (e.g., "red man syndrome").
* **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests (complete blood count, renal function tests) and teicoplanin trough level monitoring are usually recommended during treatment, particularly in patients with renal impairment or those receiving prolonged therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for teicoplanin to work?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the infection's severity.  Improvement may be seen within days to weeks.
* **Q: Can I stop taking teicoplanin if I feel better?** A: No, complete the prescribed course even if you feel better. Stopping early may lead to recurrence of the infection and development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: How should teicoplanin be stored?** A: Store teicoplanin as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Generally, this involves storage at a controlled room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to determine the best course of action.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking teicoplanin?** A:  No specific dietary restrictions are usually associated with teicoplanin.  However, maintaining a healthy diet is always beneficial for overall health and recovery.
