# Tranylcypromine
### Generic Name
Tranylcypromine

### Usage
Tranylcypromine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's specifically indicated for those who haven't responded adequately to other antidepressant treatments.  Because of the risk of serious side effects and interactions, it's not typically the first-line treatment for depression.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Major Depressive Disorder):**  The usual starting dose is 30 mg per day, taken in divided doses.  If needed, a doctor may increase the dosage by 10 mg every 1-3 weeks, but the maximum daily dose is 60 mg (30 mg twice daily).  Dosage increases should be more gradual for older adults or those at risk of low blood pressure (hypotension).  It's crucial to slowly reduce the dosage when stopping treatment to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of tranylcypromine in children haven't been established. It is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in individuals with these conditions. Older adults should start with lower doses and have them gradually increased.

### Side Effects
Tranylcypromine can cause a range of side effects, some common and some less frequent but potentially serious.  

**Common Side Effects:**

* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Sleep disturbances
* Fatigue
* Weakness
* Tremor
* Constipation
* Dry mouth
* Confusion
* Decreased memory


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypertensive crisis (dangerously high blood pressure)
* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition)
* Liver damage
* Seizures

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Tranylcypromine is a non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).  MAO is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain. By inhibiting MAO, tranylcypromine increases the levels of these neurotransmitters, which are believed to play a role in mood regulation. This increase in neurotransmitter activity is thought to be the mechanism by which tranylcypromine alleviates depression.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Tranylcypromine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to it, pheochromocytoma (a rare adrenal gland tumor), or those currently taking other MAOIs, certain antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, etc.), sympathomimetics, or meperidine.  It should also be avoided with foods and beverages high in tyramine.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Tranylcypromine interacts significantly with numerous medications. It’s crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you’re taking.  Particular caution is needed with other MAOIs, SSRIs, SNRIs, sympathomimetics, bupropion, and meperidine.
* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:**  Tranylcypromine is a Category C pregnancy drug (meaning potential risks are not fully understood). It's excreted in breast milk and should be avoided during breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly orthostatic hypotension.  Lower starting doses and gradual increases are recommended.
* **Tyramine-Rich Foods:**  Patients on tranylcypromine must strictly avoid foods and beverages high in tyramine (aged cheeses, cured meats, certain alcoholic beverages). Consumption of these can lead to a hypertensive crisis.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for tranylcypromine to work?** A: The onset of antidepressant effects can vary significantly, but it may take several weeks to see a noticeable improvement.

* **Q: How should I store tranylcypromine?** A: Store it as directed by your doctor or pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking tranylcypromine?** A: No, alcohol is generally not recommended while on tranylcypromine due to potential interactions and increased risk of side effects.  This is particularly true for alcoholic beverages that might be high in tyramine.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking tranylcypromine suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping tranylcypromine can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor for a gradual tapering-off schedule.
