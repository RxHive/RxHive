# Tranylcypromine

**Generic Name:** Tranylcypromine

**Usage:** Tranylcypromine is an antidepressant medication primarily used to treat atypical depression and depression that hasn't responded to other treatments.  It's also sometimes used off-label for other conditions, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision.  It's a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), a class of antidepressants that work differently than SSRIs or SNRIs.  Its use is often reserved for cases where other antidepressants have proven ineffective due to its potential for serious drug interactions.

**Side Effects:** Tranylcypromine can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious. Common side effects include:

* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping or staying asleep.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect.
* **Dry mouth:** Reduced saliva production.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, potentially causing dizziness or fainting.
* **Weight gain:**  Increased appetite and weight gain are possible.
* **Sexual dysfunction:** Changes in libido or ability to achieve orgasm.
* **Anxiety:** Increased nervousness or worry.

**Serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention:**  These include:

* **Hypertensive crisis:** A dangerously high blood pressure, potentially life-threatening. This is often triggered by consuming foods containing tyramine (see FAQs).
* **Serotonin syndrome:** A potentially life-threatening condition characterized by agitation, confusion, muscle rigidity, fever, and rapid heart rate.  This can occur if tranilcypromine is combined with other serotonergic drugs.
* **Liver damage:**  Rare but potentially serious.


**How it Works:** Tranylcypromine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). MAO is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters like norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the brain. By inhibiting MAO, tranylcypromine increases the levels of these neurotransmitters, leading to improved mood and a reduction in depressive symptoms.  The exact mechanism by which it improves mood is not fully understood.


**FAQs:**

* **What is a tyramine-restricted diet?**  Because tranilcypromine inhibits MAO, which also breaks down tyramine in the body, consuming foods high in tyramine can lead to a dangerous increase in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis).  Patients taking tranilcypromine must strictly adhere to a tyramine-restricted diet, avoiding aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented foods, some alcoholic beverages, and other high-tyramine foods.  A doctor or dietitian can provide a detailed list.

* **What are the drug interactions?**  Tranylcypromine interacts significantly with many other medications, including other antidepressants (especially SSRIs and SNRIs), decongestants, and certain pain relievers.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting tranilcypromine.  There's a significant washout period required between stopping other medications and starting Tranylcypromine, and vice-versa.

* **How long does it take to work?** The therapeutic effects of tranilcypromine may not be fully apparent for several weeks.

* **Is tranilcypromine addictive?** Tranylcypromine is not considered physically addictive, but stopping it abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  It should always be discontinued under the supervision of a doctor.

* **Who shouldn't take tranilcypromine?** People with certain medical conditions, such as uncontrolled hypertension, phaeochromocytoma, and those who have recently had a stroke or heart attack, should generally not take tranilcypromine.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should also be discussed with a doctor before initiating treatment.
