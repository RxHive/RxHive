# Tacrolimus (Extended Release)
### Generic Name
Tacrolimus (Extended Release)

### Usage

Tacrolimus (extended-release) is primarily used to prevent organ rejection in patients who have received a kidney, liver, or heart transplant.  It's crucial to understand that it's typically used *in combination* with other immunosuppressant drugs, not as a standalone treatment.  This combination approach helps to minimize the body's immune response against the transplanted organ.  While its primary use is in transplant settings, tacrolimus has also shown promise in treating certain other conditions, though these uses are less established and often considered off-label.  These may include some forms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a complication of stem cell transplantation; pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); and hemorrhagic cystitis (bladder inflammation).  However, it's critical to note that the use of tacrolimus for conditions outside of organ transplant rejection should be guided by a physician's expertise.

### Dosage

Dosage of tacrolimus extended-release varies significantly based on the type of transplant, the patient's weight and overall health, and their response to the medication.  It's also important to emphasize that tacrolimus extended-release is *not interchangeable* with immediate-release formulations and requires careful dose conversion under medical supervision.  Precise dosage instructions are always determined and adjusted by the transplant team (physician and pharmacist) based on regular blood tests to monitor tacrolimus levels (trough levels).  These levels need to be maintained within a specific therapeutic range to ensure efficacy and minimize side effects.  Here's a general overview:

* **Kidney Transplant (Conversion from Immediate-Release):**  The initial dose of tacrolimus extended-release is usually calculated as 80% of the total daily dose of the immediate-release formulation.  The dose is then adjusted based on regular blood tests (trough levels) targeting a whole blood concentration of 4-11 ng/mL.
* **Liver Transplant:**  Initial doses for adults typically range from 0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg/day given intravenously initially, later switching to the oral extended release form, and often adjusted based on the individual's response and blood levels. Target trough levels are generally 5-20 ng/mL in the first year.
* **Heart Transplant:**  Similar to liver transplant, initial doses vary and are adjusted based on blood levels.  Target trough levels are typically 10-20 ng/mL in the first three months and 5-15 ng/mL afterwards.
* **Pediatric Dosage:** Dosing in children is significantly more complex and requires specialized pediatric expertise.  The starting dose is generally lower, and close monitoring is essential.

**Administration:**  The extended-release formulation is typically taken orally once daily.  The timing of administration relative to food intake may vary depending on the specific product and physician recommendations.

### Side Effects

Tacrolimus can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  It is essential to report any unusual symptoms to a healthcare provider immediately.

* **Common Side Effects:** Diarrhea, headache, insomnia, abdominal pain, tremor, nausea, vomiting, increased blood pressure, increased serum creatinine, changes in blood sugar (hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia), increased blood potassium (hyperkalemia),  constipation, anorexia, urinary tract infections,  edema, changes in serum phosphate and magnesium.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), neurotoxicity (nervous system problems),  lymphoma and other cancers, QT prolongation (heart rhythm abnormalities),  infections,  pure red cell aplasia (a type of anemia), and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).


### How it Works

Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor.  It works by suppressing the activity of the immune system's T-lymphocytes, which are critical players in initiating the rejection of transplanted organs.  Specifically, it binds to a protein called FKBP-12 inside immune cells, creating a complex that inhibits an enzyme called calcineurin.  Calcineurin is involved in the activation of T-cells. By blocking its function, tacrolimus prevents these cells from triggering the immune response that leads to organ rejection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tacrolimus is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or any of its components.  It should be used with caution in patients with existing kidney or liver problems.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tacrolimus interacts extensively with other medications, especially those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  Simultaneous use with certain antibiotics, antifungals, or other immunosuppressants can significantly alter tacrolimus levels, requiring dose adjustments.  Grapefruit juice and St. John's Wort should be avoided due to their effects on CYP3A4.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Tacrolimus is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out. It is also excreted in breast milk and is generally not recommended during breastfeeding.
* **Vulnerable Populations:**  Older adults and those with impaired kidney or liver function may require dose adjustments and close monitoring due to an increased risk of adverse effects.  Children require careful dose titration, given their different metabolic rates and smaller body size.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking tacrolimus if I feel better?**  A: No, never stop taking tacrolimus without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to organ rejection.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: How should I store tacrolimus?** A: Store tacrolimus as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.  Many side effects can be managed.
* **Q: Is tacrolimus extended-release the same as other tacrolimus products?** A: No.  Tacrolimus extended-release formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles compared to immediate-release formulations and should not be used interchangeably without physician supervision.
