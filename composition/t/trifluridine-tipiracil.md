# Trifluridine + Tipiracil
### Generic Name
Trifluridine + Tipiracil

### Usage
Trifluridine and Tipiracil is a combination medication used to treat adults with metastatic colorectal cancer.  This treatment is specifically for patients who have already received standard treatments like fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy; anti-VEGF biological therapy; and anti-EGFR therapy (if RAS wild-type).  It's also indicated for adults with metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have undergone at least two prior chemotherapy regimens, including a fluoropyrimidine, a platinum, either a taxane or irinotecan, and HER2/neu-targeted therapy if appropriate.  In essence, it's a last-line treatment option for patients whose cancer has progressed despite other therapies.

### Dosage

**Metastatic colorectal cancer; metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma:**

* **Oral:** 35 mg/m² (based on the Trifluridine component) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 and days 8-12 of a 28-day cycle.  The maximum dose of Trifluridine is 80 mg per dose.  Doses should be rounded to the nearest 5 mg increment. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

**Important Note:** Blood counts (ANC and platelets) must be checked before starting each cycle and on day 15. Treatment should not begin unless ANC ≥ 1500/mm³, febrile neutropenia is resolved, platelets are ≥ 75,000/mm³, and any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic reactions are reduced to grade 1 or less.  Antiemetics are recommended due to the moderate to high emetic potential of this medication.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for mild impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin <1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST level).  Do not initiate therapy for moderate or severe impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** For CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min, no initial adjustment is necessary. For CrCl 15-29 mL/min, reduce the dose to 20 mg/m² BID (Trifluridine component) days 1-5 and 8-12.  If this dose is not tolerated, further reduce to 15 mg/m² BID. Discontinue permanently if the 15 mg/m² dose is not tolerated.  Dosage adjustments for CrCl < 15 mL/min and ESRD are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Toxicity Management:** A maximum of three dose reductions (to a minimum of 20 mg/m²) are allowed.  Do not re-escalate the dose once reduced.  Discontinue permanently if the 20 mg/m² dose is not tolerated. Specific dose reduction guidelines are provided for hematologic (ANC <500/mm³, platelets <50,000/mm³) and non-hematologic toxicities.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

### How it Works

Trifluridine, the active component, is a nucleoside analog that interferes with DNA synthesis by incorporating into DNA. This ultimately inhibits cancer cell growth and proliferation. Tipiracil inhibits thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme that breaks down Trifluridine. By preventing the breakdown of Trifluridine, Tipiracil increases the drug's effectiveness and duration of action in the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** In patients with hypersensitivity to Trifluridine, Tipiracil, or any formulation component.
* **Increased Risk:** Severe bone marrow suppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal toxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Trifluridine/Tipiracil can harm a developing fetus.  Effective contraception is essential for women of reproductive potential during treatment and for at least 6 months afterward. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for one day after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several potential drug interactions exist. Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist about any medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a missed dose. Continue with the next scheduled dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I vomit after taking a dose?** A: Do not re-administer the vomited dose; continue with the next scheduled dose.
