# Tegaserod
### Generic Name
Tegaserod Maleate

### Usage
Tegaserod maleate is a medication primarily used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in women under 65 years of age.  It's not approved for use in men or in women over 65 due to safety concerns.  The drug works by stimulating the movement of the bowels and improving the passage of stool.  It's important to note that Tegaserod is no longer available in many countries due to safety concerns regarding cardiovascular events.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults (women under 65 with IBS-C) is 6 mg twice daily (BID), taken orally. This should be administered at least 30 minutes before meals. Treatment should be discontinued if there is no adequate response after 4-6 weeks.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). Tegaserod is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C).
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m².  For eGFR of 15 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m², use is cautioned, and specific dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling.  Tegaserod is contraindicated in patients with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m² or end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.
* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Tegaserod have not been established in children.

### How it Works
Tegaserod is a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT4 receptor. By activating these receptors in the gut, it stimulates peristalsis (the rhythmic contractions that move food through the intestines) and increases intestinal secretions. This helps to improve bowel movements and relieve constipation.  It also modulates visceral sensitivity, which may help reduce abdominal pain associated with IBS-C.


### Precautions
Tegaserod is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Tegaserod or its components.  It carries an increased risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction), diarrhea, and suicidal ideation or behavior.  It's especially important to exercise caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, severe renal or hepatic impairment, or those with a history of mental health disorders.  The use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended due to unknown fetal and infant risks.  This medicine should not be used in combination with other gastrointestinal prokinetic agents.  Always inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking to assess potential interactions.
