# Tegaserod

**Generic Name:** Tegaserod

**Usage:** Tegaserod is a medication used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation in women.  It's important to note that Tegaserod is **no longer available in many countries**, including the United States, due to concerns about cardiovascular side effects.  Its use should only be considered if other treatment options have failed and under strict medical supervision where it remains available.

**Side Effects:**  The most significant side effects associated with Tegaserod were cardiovascular in nature, including:

* **Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and angina (chest pain).** This was the primary reason for its withdrawal from many markets.
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Diarrhea**
* **Nausea**
* **Abdominal pain**

Other less common side effects were also reported.  This is not an exhaustive list, and individuals should consult a doctor or pharmacist for complete information.

**How it Works:** Tegaserod is a 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist.  This means it selectively stimulates 5-HT4 receptors in the gut.  Activation of these receptors increases the movement of the bowels (intestinal motility), helping to relieve constipation symptoms associated with IBS.  The exact mechanism by which it alleviates IBS symptoms is not completely understood.
