# Tenapanor
### Generic Name
Tenapanor

### Usage
Tenapanor is primarily used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adults.  It works by affecting the movement of sodium and water in the intestines, leading to changes in bowel habits and reduced abdominal pain.  Currently, there are no approved uses for Tenapanor in children.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for IBS-C is 50 mg taken twice daily (BID), once in the morning and once in the evening.  It's recommended to take Tenapanor 5-10 minutes before a meal.  The medication is available in oral tablet form.  If a dose is missed, it should be skipped, and the next dose should be taken as scheduled; do not double up on doses.  Tenapanor is contraindicated in children under 6 years old due to the risk of serious dehydration.  Its use in children aged 6 to 17 years is not recommended as safety and efficacy haven't been established in this age group.  No dosage adjustments are specified for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to the manufacturer's labeling.

### How it Works
Tenapanor is a locally-acting inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the intestines.  NHE3 is a protein that helps regulate sodium and water absorption in the gut. By inhibiting NHE3, Tenapanor reduces sodium absorption, leading to increased water secretion into the intestinal lumen. This results in faster intestinal transit time and softer stools, relieving constipation.  Additionally, Tenapanor helps to reduce abdominal pain by decreasing visceral hypersensitivity and intestinal permeability.  It's important to note that the major metabolite of Tenapanor (M1) is not active against NHE3.

### Precautions
Tenapanor is contraindicated in:

* Patients with hypersensitivity to Tenapanor or any of its components.
* Patients under 6 years of age (risk of serious dehydration).
* Patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.


Tenapanor should be used with caution in patients with a history of diarrhea or dehydration.  While there's no specific information on interactions with other medications in the provided data, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking before starting Tenapanor.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the use of Tenapanor with their doctor to weigh the benefits and potential risks. The limited systemic absorption after oral administration suggests a lower risk of adverse effects on the fetus or infant, but further research is needed.
