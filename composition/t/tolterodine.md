# Tolterodine

**Generic Name:** Tolterodine

**Usage:**

Tolterodine is used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is a condition characterized by urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence (leakage of urine).  It works by relaxing the muscles in the bladder, allowing it to hold more urine and reducing the urge to urinate frequently.  It's prescribed for adults to reduce the symptoms of OAB.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Dry mouth:** This is a very common side effect.
* **Constipation:**  Difficulty in passing stool.
* **Drowsiness:** Feeling sleepy or tired.
* **Dry eyes:**  Feeling of dryness or irritation in the eyes.
* **Headache:**  Pain in the head.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.
* **Increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma:**  This is more likely in people already at risk for glaucoma.
* **Heat stroke:**  Especially in hot environments.
* **Urinary retention:**  Inability to urinate.
* **Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia):** An unusually fast heart rate.


**How it Works:**

Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic agent.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the bladder muscles to contract. By blocking acetylcholine, tolterodine relaxes the bladder muscles, reducing the frequency of bladder contractions and improving bladder capacity. This leads to less frequent urination and reduced urinary urgency and incontinence.
