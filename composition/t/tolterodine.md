# Tolterodine
### Generic Name
Tolterodine

### Usage

Tolterodine is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is a condition characterized by urinary urgency (a sudden, strong urge to urinate), urinary frequency (urinating more often than usual), and urge urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine preceded by urgency).  It's important to note that Tolterodine treats the symptoms of OAB, not the underlying cause.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage of tolterodine varies depending on the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release) and individual response.

* **Immediate-release tablets:** Typically, the starting dose is 2 mg twice daily (BID).  This may be reduced to 1 mg BID based on the patient's response and tolerability.

* **Extended-release capsules:** The usual starting dose is 4 mg once daily (OD).  This can be decreased to 2 mg OD if needed.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of tolterodine in children have not been established, and it is therefore not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  Individuals with hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment may require a lower dose or may not be able to take tolterodine at all.  Specific adjustments should be made under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Concurrent use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (like ketoconazole, clarithromycin, and ritonavir) also necessitates dose reduction.

### How it Works

Tolterodine is an anticholinergic medication, specifically a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that triggers muscle contractions in the bladder. By reducing the activity of these receptors in the bladder, tolterodine helps to relax the bladder muscles, decrease the frequency of bladder contractions, and reduce urinary urgency and incontinence.  Studies suggest it shows more selectivity for bladder receptors than salivary receptors, which helps minimize some side effects associated with other anticholinergics.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tolterodine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to tolterodine or related medications, urinary retention, gastric retention, and uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.

* **Interactions:**  Tolterodine can interact with various other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions are possible with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, prokinetic GI agents, other anticholinergic agents, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, and many others.

* **Specific Populations:**  Caution should be exercised when using tolterodine in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia), decreased gastrointestinal motility, controlled narrow-angle glaucoma, hepatic or renal impairment, or myasthenia gravis.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using tolterodine as its safety in these groups has not been fully established.

* **Warnings:** Tolterodine may cause drowsiness, dizziness, or blurred vision; therefore, patients should avoid activities requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, until they know how this medication affects them.  Patients should be monitored for anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, etc.).


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for tolterodine to start working?**  A:  The onset of effect varies but generally, improvement in symptoms may be noticeable within a few days to a few weeks of starting treatment.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking tolterodine?** A:  While there's no specific contraindication, alcohol may exacerbate some of tolterodine's side effects (e.g., drowsiness).  Consult your doctor for advice.

* **Q: How should I store tolterodine?** A: Store tolterodine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I stop taking tolterodine suddenly?** A:  No, it's important to consult your doctor before stopping tolterodine to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms or worsening of OAB symptoms.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce your dose if necessary.

* **Q:  Is tolterodine habit-forming?** A: No, tolterodine is not considered a habit-forming medication.
