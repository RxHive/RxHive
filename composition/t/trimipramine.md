# Trimipramine
### Generic Name
Trimipramine

### Usage
Trimipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat symptoms of depression.  While its main application is in managing depressive disorders, it's also sometimes used off-label to alleviate anxiety symptoms due to its sedative properties.  It's important to note that the use of trimipramine for anxiety is not as widely supported by research as its use for depression.  A healthcare professional should always determine the appropriate use of this medication.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Depression (outpatient, mild-to-moderate):** The starting oral dose is typically 75 mg per day, divided into one to three doses.  This can be increased to 150 mg/day (in divided doses), with a maintenance dose ranging from 50-150 mg/day, preferably taken as a single dose at bedtime. The maximum dose is 200 mg/day.  For older adults, it's recommended to start with 50 mg/day and gradually increase to a maximum of 100 mg/day as tolerated.

* **Depression (inpatient, moderate-to-severe):**  Treatment begins with an oral dose of 100 mg/day (divided into one to three doses).  This might be gradually increased to 200 mg/day within a few days, depending on the individual's response and tolerance.  If there's no improvement after two to three weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 250-300 mg/day.  Older adults should begin with 50 mg/day, gradually increasing to 100 mg/day.

**Children and Adolescents:**

The safety and efficacy of trimipramine have not been established in children under 12. In adolescents, the starting oral dose is 50 mg/day, gradually increased to a maximum of 100 mg/day depending on response and tolerance.  Maintenance should be at the lowest effective dose, preferably given at bedtime.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment; therefore, caution is advised when using trimipramine in patients with these conditions.

* **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):**  There must be a 14-day gap between stopping an MAOI and starting trimipramine, and vice-versa.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Weight gain
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Seizures
* Liver damage
* Severe allergic reactions


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

The exact mechanism by which trimipramine works is not fully understood.  However, it's believed to affect the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.  By influencing these chemicals, it helps alleviate the symptoms of depression and, to a lesser extent, anxiety. It does not work by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Trimipramine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or other tricyclic antidepressants, acute recovery from a myocardial infarction, concurrent use of MAOIs, or initiation in patients receiving linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.

* **Drug Interactions:** Trimipramine can interact with several other medications, including cimetidine (which can affect its elimination), alcohol (which can exacerbate its effects), and MAOIs (which can cause potentially dangerous interactions).  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Trimipramine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  It's generally avoided during breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, or urinary retention.  Patients with diabetes or hepatic or renal impairment also require careful monitoring.  Older adults and those with pre-existing conditions may require lower doses and close monitoring.  The risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is a concern, particularly in younger adults.


### FAQs

* **Can I drive while taking trimipramine?**  Drowsiness is a common side effect, so driving or operating machinery should be avoided until you know how the medication affects you.

* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to notice a significant improvement in symptoms.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose.

* **Can I stop taking trimipramine suddenly?**  No, abrupt discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms. Always talk to your doctor before stopping the medication; they will advise on a gradual tapering schedule.

* **How should I store trimipramine?** Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and children.

* **What should I do in case of an overdose?** Contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately.
