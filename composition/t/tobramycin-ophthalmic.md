# Tobramycin (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Tobramycin (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Tobramycin ophthalmic is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the outer eye and its surrounding structures (eyelid, conjunctiva).  It's effective against a range of susceptible bacteria commonly causing conditions like conjunctivitis (pink eye), blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid), and other superficial eye infections.  It's primarily used for bacterial infections, not viral or fungal ones.


### Dosage

**Ocular Infections:**

* **Adults and Children (â‰¥2 months):** Dosage varies depending on the severity of the infection and the formulation (ointment or solution).

    * **Ointment (0.3%):** For mild to moderate infections, apply a half-inch ribbon into the affected eye(s) two to three times daily. For severe infections, apply every three to four hours initially, then reduce frequency as the infection improves before discontinuing treatment.

    * **Solution (0.3%):** For mild to moderate infections, instill one to two drops into the affected eye(s) every four hours. For severe infections, instill two drops every hour initially, then reduce frequency as the infection improves before discontinuation.

    * **Viscous Solution (0.3%):** For mild to moderate infections, instill one drop into the affected eye(s) twice daily for seven days. For severe infections, instill one drop four times daily on the first day, then twice daily for the remainder of the treatment period.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment because systemic absorption is low with ophthalmic use.  However, it's crucial to inform your doctor of any kidney or liver problems.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Conjunctival erythema (redness of the conjunctiva)
* Eyelid edema (swelling of the eyelid)
* Eyelid pruritus (itching of the eyelid)

Less common but more serious side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
* Severe eye pain
* Vision changes
* Signs of superinfection (e.g., worsening infection, new infection)

### How it Works

Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis.  It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacterial ribosomes, preventing the bacteria from producing essential proteins needed for growth and survival. This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death and helps clear the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tobramycin ophthalmic is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tobramycin, other aminoglycosides, or any component of the formulation.
* **Cross-Sensitivity:**  There's a risk of cross-sensitivity to other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Allergic reactions, ranging from mild to severe, are possible.
* **Superinfection:**  The risk of developing a secondary infection from non-susceptible organisms (including fungi) increases with prolonged use.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tobramycin is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. While the risk to the fetus appears low,  it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using tobramycin during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, necessitating cautious use.
* **Contact Lenses:**  Do not wear contact lenses during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see improvement?** A: Improvement usually begins within a few days, but the full course of treatment should be completed, even if symptoms improve earlier.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I use tobramycin ophthalmic for ear infections?** A: No, this formulation is for ophthalmic (eye) use only. Use only as directed.
* **Q: How should I store tobramycin ophthalmic?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q:  Should I stop using tobramycin if my symptoms improve?** A:  No. Always complete the prescribed course of treatment to prevent recurrence of the infection.
