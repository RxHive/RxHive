# Thioguanine
### Generic Name
Thioguanine

### Usage
Thioguanine, also known as Tioguanine, is primarily used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  It's employed in both remission induction (getting the leukemia under control) and consolidation (further reducing the leukemia cells after remission is achieved).  It's important to note that its use for AML maintenance therapy or other long-term continuous treatments is not recommended due to the significant risk of liver damage (hepatotoxicity).  While not its primary use, thioguanine may be used off-label in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), typically in specific phases of treatment like late intensification.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage of thioguanine for AML is typically 2 mg/kg orally once daily for four weeks. If there's no clinical improvement after four weeks and blood cell counts (ANC and platelets) aren't suppressed, the dose may be cautiously increased to 3 mg/kg once daily under close monitoring. For ALL (off-label use, late intensification), a dose of 60 mg/m² once daily may be used on specific days as part of a multi-drug regimen.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosing varies greatly depending on the specific leukemia (ALL or AML), the treatment regimen, and the child's age and weight.  It is administered orally.  Dosage regimens include mg/kg/day divided doses and mg/m²/day depending on the specific protocol.  **Crucially,  testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) deficiencies is recommended in children before starting thioguanine.** These deficiencies significantly impact how the body processes the drug, and altering the dose based on the test results is essential to avoid severe toxicity.  Consult the prescribing information for the specific regimen and appropriate adjustments for the patient's age, weight, and genetic makeup.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
*   Anemia (low red blood cell count)
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Stomatitis (mouth sores)
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) – including jaundice, increased liver enzymes, and potentially life-threatening liver failure.
*   Bone marrow suppression (severe decrease in blood cell production).
*   Infections (due to weakened immune system).
*   Increased risk of secondary cancers.
*   Tumor lysis syndrome (rapid breakdown of cancer cells leading to kidney problems)


If any adverse effects occur, immediate consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary.


### How it Works

Thioguanine is an antimetabolite, a type of chemotherapy drug. It works by interfering with the synthesis and function of DNA and RNA, essential components of cancer cells.  Specifically, it's a purine analog meaning its structure mimics a naturally occurring building block of DNA and RNA called purines.  The body incorporates thioguanine into the DNA and RNA of rapidly dividing cancer cells, disrupting their growth and reproduction leading to cell death.


### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:**  Thioguanine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to thioguanine or any of its components.
*   **Prior Resistance:** It's contraindicated in patients who have previously shown resistance to thioguanine or mercaptopurine (a closely related drug).
*   **Myelosuppression:** Thioguanine can suppress bone marrow function, leading to decreased production of blood cells. Regular monitoring of blood counts is crucial.
*   **Hepatotoxicity:** Thioguanine can cause severe liver damage. Regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential.  The risk is particularly elevated with long-term or continuous use.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Thioguanine can interact with other medications, including certain antineoplastic agents, immunosuppressants, and others.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications being taken.  Concomitant use with busulfan is associated with increased hepatotoxicity risk.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Thioguanine is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning there is a demonstrated risk to the fetus.  Women of reproductive age should use effective contraception during treatment. The excretion of thioguanine into breast milk is unknown.
*   **TPMT and NUDT15 deficiencies:**  Genetic variations in TPMT and NUDT15 enzymes significantly influence how the body processes thioguanine.  Testing for these deficiencies is highly recommended to optimize dosage and minimize toxicity.
*   **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with reduced kidney or liver function, although manufacturer's labeling may not provide specific guidance.  Close monitoring is essential.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is thioguanine stored?** A: Store thioguanine at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  Always follow the specific storage instructions provided on the product labeling.

*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking thioguanine?** A: Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage. Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider; do not double the dose without guidance.

*   **Q: Can I take other medications with thioguanine?** A: Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

*   **Q: How long will I need to take thioguanine?** A:  The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on individual response to treatment and the specific disease. Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

*   **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A:  There aren't specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet can help support your body during treatment.
