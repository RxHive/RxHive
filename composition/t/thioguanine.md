# Thioguanine

**Generic Name:** Thioguanine

**Usage:**

Thioguanine is a purine analog antineoplastic (cancer-fighting) medication.  Its primary use is in the treatment of:

* **Acute myeloid leukemia (AML):**  Often used in induction and maintenance chemotherapy regimens.
* **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL):**  Can be used in certain treatment protocols.
* **Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML):** Less common use, usually in combination with other therapies.
* **Crohn's disease:** Though less common now due to better tolerated alternatives, it may be used in severe cases unresponsive to other treatments.


**Side Effects:**

Thioguanine's side effects can range from mild to severe, and depend on the dosage and individual patient factors.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite
* **Hematologic:**  Bone marrow suppression (leading to low blood cell counts â€“ anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), increased risk of infection, bleeding
* **Hepatic:** Liver damage (hepatotoxicity), elevated liver enzymes
* **Renal:** Kidney problems
* **Skin:** Rash, itching
* **Other:**  Fatigue, weakness, hair loss (alopecia), mouth sores (stomatitis)


Severe side effects, while less common, can include:

* **Severe bone marrow suppression:** Requiring blood transfusions or growth factor support.
* **Severe liver damage:** Potentially leading to liver failure.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas.


**How it Works:**

Thioguanine is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form (thioguanine nucleotides) inside cells.  These active metabolites interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis.  They are incorporated into DNA and RNA, disrupting their normal function and ultimately leading to cell death, particularly in rapidly dividing cancer cells.  The specific mechanism is complex and involves several metabolic pathways.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is thioguanine administered?** A: Thioguanine is typically given orally as a tablet.
* **Q: How long is the treatment course?** A: The duration of thioguanine treatment varies greatly depending on the disease, the treatment protocol, and the patient's response. It can range from weeks to months or even longer.
* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?** A: Thioguanine can interact with several other medications, particularly other drugs that affect the liver or bone marrow.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Q: What monitoring is required during treatment?** A: Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor blood counts (complete blood count or CBC), liver function, and kidney function.
* **Q: Are there any specific precautions?** A: Patients should report any signs of infection, bleeding, unusual bruising, or significant changes in their bowel habits.  Alcohol consumption may increase the risk of liver damage.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception.
* **Q: Is thioguanine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Thioguanine is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to the potential for harm to the developing fetus or infant.
