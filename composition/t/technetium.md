# Technetium
### Generic Name
Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab

### Usage

Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab is a radiopharmaceutical used in diagnostic imaging, specifically for labeling white blood cells (WBCs) and myeloid precursors.  Its primary use is in identifying and visualizing inflammatory processes within the body.  This is achieved by labeling the patient's own white blood cells with the radioactive technetium, allowing doctors to track their migration and accumulation at sites of infection or inflammation.  While primarily used for infection localization, it may also be used to assess bone marrow function in some cases.  Note that this is not a therapeutic agent; it's solely for diagnostic purposes.

### Dosage

The dosage of Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab is determined by the physician based on the patient's individual needs and the specific imaging procedure. It is usually administered intravenously (IV) after the patient's white blood cells have been labeled with the radiopharmaceutical in a specialized laboratory setting. There is no standardized dosage across all patients; the amount administered depends on factors like the patient's weight, the area to be imaged, and the imaging technique used. Specific dosage instructions must be obtained from the prescribing physician and the nuclear medicine department.  Dosage information for children is determined on a case-by-case basis and is handled by medical professionals experienced in pediatric nuclear medicine.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Transient injection site reactions (redness, swelling, pain).
* Mild allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.

Serious side effects are rare but can include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.

It is crucial to report any unusual symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab works by binding to the CD15 antigen found on the surface of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), monocytes, and eosinophils. These are types of white blood cells that are drawn to areas of inflammation and infection in the body.  Once the patient's WBCs are labeled with this radiopharmaceutical, they are re-infused. The radioactive technetium emits gamma rays, which can be detected by a special imaging device (gamma camera). This allows doctors to visualize the location and extent of infection or inflammation where the labeled WBCs have accumulated.  The short half-life of Technetium-99m ensures that radiation exposure is minimized.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Patients with known allergies to murine proteins or any component of the formulation should be carefully monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only undertaken when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.  Consult with a physician specialized in nuclear medicine and pregnancy risk assessment.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, as interactions are unlikely but possible.
* **Renal or Hepatic Impairment:** Patients with significant kidney or liver problems may require dose adjustments or careful monitoring.  This is determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician.
* **Radiation Safety:**  Follow all instructions given by the nuclear medicine staff regarding radiation safety protocols.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the imaging procedure take?** A: The imaging procedure itself may take 30 minutes to an hour or more, but the preparation and post-procedure time will add to the overall time spent at the facility.

* **Q: Is there any special preparation needed before the procedure?** A: Yes, specific instructions will be given by the nuclear medicine department, and may include fasting or other dietary restrictions.

* **Q: How long will I be radioactive after the procedure?** A: The radioactivity from Technetium Tc 99m decays relatively quickly, minimizing radiation exposure. However, you will still need to follow post-procedure instructions from the medical staff to ensure your safety and the safety of others.

* **Q: Are there any long-term side effects?** A:  Long-term side effects from Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab are extremely rare. However, as with any medical procedure, it is crucial to report any concerns to your physician.

* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: This medication is handled and stored by a licensed nuclear medicine department and should not be stored at home.
