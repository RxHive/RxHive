# Tafamidis

**Generic Name:** Tafamidis

**Usage:**

Tafamidis is used to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).  ATTR-CM is a progressive disease where abnormal transthyretin protein deposits in the heart, leading to heart failure.  Tafamidis is specifically indicated to reduce cardiovascular mortality (death from heart-related causes) in patients with ATTR-CM. It may also help slow the progression of the disease and improve symptoms.  It's important to note that Tafamidis does not cure ATTR-CM, but rather aims to slow its progression.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of tafamidis can include:

* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Upper respiratory tract infection:** Common cold or similar illness.
* **Back pain:** Pain in the back.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or lacking energy.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These can include:

* **Serious allergic reactions:** such as swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; hives.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms might include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain, or nausea.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  It's crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to a doctor.


**How it Works:**

Tafamidis is a stabilizer of transthyretin (TTR).  TTR is a protein that normally carries thyroxine (a thyroid hormone) and retinol (a form of vitamin A) in the blood.  In ATTR-CM, TTR misfolds and forms amyloid fibrils that accumulate in various tissues, including the heart.  Tafamidis works by binding to TTR, preventing it from misfolding and forming these harmful amyloid deposits.  By stabilizing TTR, it slows the progression of the disease and reduces cardiovascular mortality.
