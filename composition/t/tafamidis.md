# Tafamidis
### Generic Name
Tafamidis

### Usage
Tafamidis is primarily used to treat transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).  ATTR-CM is a progressive and often fatal disease where misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein deposits in the heart, leading to heart failure. Tafamidis works by stabilizing the TTR protein, preventing it from misfolding and forming amyloid fibrils that damage the heart muscle. This helps slow the progression of the disease and improve symptoms.  While primarily used for ATTR-CM, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other transthyretin amyloidosis related conditions.


### Dosage
Dosage of Tafamidis varies depending on the formulation (oral capsules) and the individual's health status.  It's crucial to follow the prescription provided by your physician exactly.  Generally:

* **Adults (Oral Capsules):** The typical starting dose is 80 mg once daily. Your doctor may adjust this based on your response and tolerance.  There are currently no pediatric formulations or approved dosages for children.


* **IV Administration:** Currently, there is no IV formulation of Tafamidis available.


**Important Note:** Dosage adjustments are not typically based on weight or specific severity measures in the same way as some other medications.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your individual needs and response to the treatment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects reported with Tafamidis include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Back pain
* Diarrhea


Less common, but potentially serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Liver enzyme elevation
*  Increased risk of falls (particularly in the elderly)

If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above,  contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Tafamidis is a kinetic stabilizer of transthyretin (TTR).  TTR is a protein that transports thyroxine and retinol in the blood. In ATTR-CM, TTR misfolds and forms amyloid fibrils, accumulating in the heart muscle and causing damage. Tafamidis binds to TTR, preventing it from misfolding and thereby slowing down the formation of amyloid fibrils.  This reduces the damage to the heart muscle, helping to improve symptoms and slow disease progression. It's important to note that Tafamidis doesn't reverse existing damage, but it aims to prevent further damage from occurring.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Tafamidis is generally well-tolerated, but individuals with known hypersensitivity to Tafamidis or any of its components should avoid its use.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Currently, there are no significant known drug interactions reported with Tafamidis; however, informing your physician of all medications you are taking is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Tafamidis during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before taking Tafamidis if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may have an increased risk of falls.  Close monitoring may be necessary.
* **Liver Function:** Monitor liver function tests regularly as changes in liver enzymes have been reported.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Tafamidis?**  A:  The effects of Tafamidis are usually not immediate. It may take several months to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms.  Regular monitoring by your cardiologist is essential to assess progress.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Tafamidis if I feel better?** A: No, do not stop taking Tafamidis without consulting your doctor.  Consistent treatment is crucial to manage the disease effectively.

* **Q: How should I store Tafamidis?** A: Store Tafamidis capsules at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Is Tafamidis a cure for ATTR-CM?** A: No, Tafamidis is not a cure, but it's a disease-modifying therapy that slows the progression of ATTR-CM.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
