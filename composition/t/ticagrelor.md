# Ticagrelor
### Generic Name
Ticagrelor

### Usage
Ticagrelor is a medication primarily used to reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events in adults.  Its main application is in patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which encompasses conditions like unstable angina and heart attacks (myocardial infarction or MI).  It's particularly effective in reducing the chances of death from cardiovascular causes, further heart attacks, and strokes in these individuals.

Beyond ACS, ticagrelor is also used to lessen the risk of stent thrombosis (a blood clot forming inside a coronary stent) following a procedure to place a stent in a coronary artery.  It also finds application in reducing the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and reducing stroke risk in patients who've had a minor ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score ≤ 5) or a high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA).


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The information below is for general knowledge and should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional. Dosage adjustments are frequently based on individual patient factors and the specific clinical situation.

**Adults:**

* **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - ST-elevation MI or Non-ST elevation MI:**
    * **Loading Dose:** 180 mg orally, as soon as possible after diagnosis.  This is usually given in combination with aspirin and a parenteral (injected) anticoagulant.
    * **Maintenance Dose:** 90 mg twice daily (BID) for the first 12 months, then typically reduced to 60 mg BID.  This is also given with aspirin. In some high-risk patients, the 90 mg BID dose may continue.

* **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - High Risk for Ischemic Events:** 60 mg BID, along with aspirin, indefinitely.

* **Minor Ischemic Stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 5) or High-Risk TIA:** 180 mg loading dose once, then 90 mg BID for 30 days, combined with aspirin.


**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of ticagrelor in children haven't been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. Those with mild impairment may not require adjustments, but caution is advised in moderate impairment, and severe impairment necessitates avoiding ticagrelor altogether. Renal (kidney) impairment generally does not require dose changes.  Switching from other P2Y12 inhibitors (like clopidogrel or prasugrel) requires specific guidance from a physician regarding timing and dosage.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Dizziness
* Nausea


**Less Common, But Serious Side Effects:**

* Major or minor bleeding (this is a significant risk with ticagrelor)
* Atrioventricular block (a heart rhythm disturbance)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) – a rare but life-threatening blood disorder
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, rash)


If any side effects occur, particularly concerning ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor. Platelets are blood cells essential for blood clotting.  Ticagrelor works by preventing platelets from clumping together (aggregating), thereby reducing the risk of blood clots forming in blood vessels. It achieves this by reversibly blocking the P2Y12 receptor on the platelet surface, a key player in platelet activation.  By inhibiting platelet aggregation, ticagrelor lowers the risk of cardiovascular events associated with clot formation.


### Precautions

* **Bleeding Risk:** Ticagrelor significantly increases the risk of bleeding, which can be severe or even fatal.  Patients with active bleeding, history of intracranial hemorrhage, or those undergoing certain surgeries should avoid this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ticagrelor interacts with several other medications, including strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.  Aspirin doses exceeding 100mg daily can reduce ticagrelor's effectiveness.  Consult a doctor about all medications being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ticagrelor use during pregnancy is not recommended due to potential risks to the fetus.  It's also not advisable to breastfeed while taking ticagrelor.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use caution in patients with moderate liver impairment, and avoid use in those with severe liver impairment.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Increased vigilance is needed in older adults who are more susceptible to side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ticagrelor with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose. Skip the missed dose and take the next one as scheduled.
* **Q: How should I store ticagrelor?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking ticagrelor suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking ticagrelor abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping it suddenly can increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
* **Q: Is ticagrelor safe for everyone?** A: No, it's not suitable for everyone.  Those with certain conditions or those taking particular medications should not take this drug without consulting their healthcare provider.
