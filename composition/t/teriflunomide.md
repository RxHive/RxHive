# Teriflunomide
### Generic Name
Teriflunomide

### Usage
Teriflunomide is primarily used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).  Relapsing MS is characterized by periods of disease activity (relapses) followed by periods of remission where symptoms improve or disappear.  Teriflunomide helps to reduce the frequency of these relapses and slow the progression of disability associated with MS.  It's important to note that teriflunomide doesn't cure MS, but rather manages its symptoms and progression.

### Dosage
The dosage of teriflunomide is determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and tolerance.  Generally, for adults with multiple sclerosis, the oral dosage is either 7 mg or 14 mg once daily.

* **Adults:** The typical starting dose is 7mg daily, which may be increased to 14mg daily depending on response and tolerance.  This adjustment should only be made by a healthcare provider.
* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of teriflunomide in children haven't been established, so it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are needed in specific cases. Individuals with severe hepatic impairment should not use teriflunomide.  Mild to moderate hepatic impairment generally does not require dosage adjustment, but careful monitoring is crucial. Similarly, renal impairment usually does not necessitate a dose change.  If toxicity occurs (such as elevated liver enzymes), the medication should be discontinued, and procedures to accelerate elimination of the drug from the body may be necessary (using cholestyramine or activated charcoal).  This process is overseen by healthcare professionals.


### Side Effects
Like all medications, teriflunomide can cause side effects. Some are common, others are less frequent but more serious. It's essential to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Low phosphate levels in the blood (hypophosphatemia)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Low lymphocyte count (lymphocytopenia)
* Elevated liver enzymes (increased alanine aminotransferase)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or reported post-marketing):**

* Paresthesia (tingling or numbness)
* High blood pressure (hypertension)
* Low neutrophil count (neutropenia)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity â€“ potentially severe)
* Increased serum creatinine levels (kidney function indicator)
* Interstitial lung disease
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reaction)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


**Important Note:**  This list is not exhaustive.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while taking teriflunomide.

### How it Works
Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug; it modifies the body's immune response. Specifically, it's a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor.  This means it blocks the production of pyrimidines, which are essential building blocks for DNA and RNA in rapidly dividing cells, including certain immune cells that contribute to the inflammation and damage characteristic of MS. By reducing the activity of these immune cells, teriflunomide helps to lessen the inflammation and damage in the central nervous system (CNS), thus reducing the frequency and severity of MS relapses.


### Precautions
Several precautions are vital when considering teriflunomide:

* **Pregnancy:** Teriflunomide is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to the developing fetus. It's contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing age who are not using effective contraception.  Reliable contraception is necessary before, during, and for a significant period after treatment.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It's not known if teriflunomide is excreted in breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
* **Liver Disease:**  Teriflunomide is contraindicated in individuals with severe liver disease.  Those with mild to moderate liver impairment require close monitoring.  Regular liver function tests are essential.
* **Drug Interactions:** Teriflunomide can interact with numerous other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to assess potential interactions.  Some interactions may require dosage adjustments or avoidance of specific combinations.
* **Infections:**  Teriflunomide can suppress the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.  Patients should report any signs or symptoms of infection promptly.  Certain live vaccines should be avoided during and after treatment.
* **Other Considerations:**  Patients with a history of significant hematologic abnormalities should use teriflunomide with caution and under close medical supervision. Elderly patients and those with specific health conditions (like diabetes) may also require more frequent monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for teriflunomide to start working?** A:  The effects of teriflunomide are gradual and may not be immediately noticeable.  It typically takes several weeks or months to see a significant impact on MS symptoms.

* **Q: How long should I take teriflunomide?** A: The duration of treatment is determined by your healthcare provider based on your individual response and needs.  Treatment may be long-term.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store teriflunomide?** A: Store teriflunomide as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking teriflunomide?** A:  Consult your doctor.  Excessive alcohol consumption may increase the risk of liver damage.

* **Q:  What happens if I need to stop taking teriflunomide suddenly?** A: Do not stop taking teriflunomide suddenly without consulting your doctor.  A gradual tapering-off process may be necessary to minimize potential withdrawal effects or other complications.

* **Q: How is teriflunomide eliminated from the body?** A:  Teriflunomide has a long half-life meaning it stays in your system for a long time. If you need to stop treatment quickly because of pregnancy or toxicity, a process using cholestyramine or activated charcoal will be used to speed up its removal from your body.
