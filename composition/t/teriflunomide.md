# Teriflunomide

**Generic Name:** Teriflunomide

**Usage:**  Teriflunomide is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults.  It helps to reduce the number of relapses (worsening of symptoms) and the progression of disability.

**Side Effects:**  Teriflunomide can cause a range of side effects, some common and some rare.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is often a significant side effect and may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of the medication.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Hair thinning or loss (alopecia):**  Can range from mild to moderate.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  Blood tests are routinely monitored to check for this.
* **Increased risk of infection:**  The immune system is somewhat suppressed.
* **High blood pressure:**  Regular monitoring is necessary.
* **Abnormal blood counts:** Requires blood tests for monitoring.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Serious liver problems:**  Liver function tests are essential.
* **Serious lung problems:**  Including interstitial lung disease (ILD).
* **Severe skin reactions:**  Such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.


**How it Works:** Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug. It works by interfering with the production of pyrimidine, which are building blocks for DNA and RNA. This interferes with the proliferation of immune cells that are thought to be involved in the damage to the myelin sheath (the protective covering around nerve fibers) in MS. By suppressing the activity of these immune cells, it helps to reduce inflammation and damage in the central nervous system.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full therapeutic effect of teriflunomide may not be seen for several months.

* **Q: Do I need blood tests regularly?** A: Yes, regular blood tests are necessary to monitor liver function and blood counts.  The frequency of these tests will be determined by your doctor.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking teriflunomide?** A:  It's generally advised to limit alcohol consumption while taking teriflunomide, as it can put extra stress on your liver.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: What happens if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Q: How long does it take to wash out of my system?** A: Because of its long half-life, it can take a significant amount of time to eliminate teriflunomide from your system.  A washout procedure using cholestyramine is typically required if you need to discontinue treatment quickly, such as before pregnancy.

* **Q: Can I take teriflunomide if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: No. Teriflunomide is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Effective contraception is mandatory.
