# Terbinafine
### Generic Name
Terbinafine

### Usage
Terbinafine is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat fungal skin infections like athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm (tinea corporis), and fungal infections of the nails (onychomycosis).  It's effective against a broad range of dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds. While primarily used topically (applied to the skin), terbinafine is also available in oral form for more severe or widespread infections, particularly those affecting the nails.  In such cases, oral terbinafine is often the preferred treatment option because it can reach the deeper layers of the skin and nails where the infection resides.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the type of infection, the severity, the patient's age and weight, and the form of the medication (oral or topical).  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions precisely.

**Oral Terbinafine:** The dosage is usually determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs.  A common dosage for adults might be 250mg once daily, but this can vary.  Children's dosages are calculated based on weight and are always prescribed by a physician.  Oral terbinafine should be taken with food to minimize potential stomach upset.

**Topical Terbinafine:**  Topical formulations (creams, lotions, powders, and sprays) have varying concentrations.  Application involves a thin layer applied to the affected area once or twice daily, as directed on the product label or by a healthcare provider. Treatment duration varies depending on the infection's severity and location.

**IV Terbinafine:** Intravenous administration of terbinafine is not a common route; oral or topical application is typically preferred unless specific circumstances warrant IV therapy under the close supervision of a physician.

### How it Works

Terbinafine works by inhibiting an enzyme called squalene epoxidase, which is essential for the synthesis of ergosterol. Ergosterol is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting squalene epoxidase, terbinafine disrupts ergosterol production, leading to damage and eventual death of the fungal cells.  This mechanism selectively targets fungal cells, leaving human cells relatively unharmed.


### Precautions

* **Liver Disease:** Terbinafine can be harmful to the liver; individuals with pre-existing liver conditions should use it with extreme caution or avoid it altogether.  Regular liver function tests may be necessary during treatment.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption while taking terbinafine can increase the risk of liver damage.
* **Drug Interactions:** Terbinafine can interact with certain medications, including some blood thinners,  immunosuppressants, and other drugs metabolized by the liver. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Terbinafine's use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered, balancing the benefits against potential risks.  Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Kidney Disease:** Individuals with impaired kidney function may require dose adjustments.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for terbinafine to work?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the type and severity of the infection.  For skin infections, improvement may be noticeable within a week or two, but nail infections often require several months of treatment.

* **Q: Can I stop taking terbinafine once I feel better?** A: No.  Complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better before the medication is finished.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection.

* **Q: How should I store terbinafine?** A: Store terbinafine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Is terbinafine safe for children?** A: Terbinafine can be used in children, but the dosage and suitability should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  It's not typically recommended for very young children without a doctor's prescription.
