# Tretinoin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Tretinoin (Systemic)

### Usage
Tretinoin (systemic) is primarily used to induce remission in patients diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a specific type of leukemia categorized as M3 (including the M3 variant) under the French-American-British (FAB) classification. This type of APL is characterized by the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the PML/RAR-alpha gene.  While its primary use is in treating APL,  it's sometimes used off-label in consolidation and maintenance therapies for APL, often in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents like arsenic trioxide or anthracyclines.  These off-label uses are typically determined on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional experienced in managing leukemia.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical dosage for remission induction in APL is 45 mg/m²/day, divided into two equal doses, administered orally. Treatment continues until complete remission (CR) is achieved, typically lasting up to 90 days.  After achieving CR, treatment is discontinued after 30 days or after 90 days of treatment, whichever comes first.  Dosages and treatment durations may differ when tretinoin is used in combination with other therapies (like anthracyclines, cytarabine, or arsenic trioxide) for remission induction, consolidation, or maintenance.  Consult specific treatment protocols for these combination therapies.  The off-label use in consolidation or maintenance therapy involves variable dosages and durations, often determined based on individual patient needs and response to treatment.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages vary depending on the phase of treatment (induction, consolidation, maintenance) and specific treatment regimen.  Typical dosages range from 25 mg/m²/day, divided into two doses.  Specific details about dosage and administration should be obtained from a pediatric oncologist or healthcare professional experienced in treating childhood leukemia.  Always carefully follow the physician's prescribed regimen.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Dosage adjustments should be made under the close supervision of a healthcare professional who can carefully monitor the patient for side effects and adjust the dose as necessary based on individual clinical response.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Headache, malaise, nausea, vomiting, dry mucous membranes, skin rash, and elevated liver enzymes are commonly reported.

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  APL differentiation syndrome (characterized by fever, respiratory distress, edema, and potential organ failure),  cardiovascular effects (including venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction), CNS effects (such as seizures and intracranial hypertension), leukocytosis, and lipid abnormalities are serious but less frequent side effects.

**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive. If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, immediately consult your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Tretinoin is a retinoic acid derivative. It works by binding to specific receptors within the nucleus of APL cells. This binding process alters gene expression, leading to decreased proliferation (reduction in cell growth) and differentiation (maturation) of these leukemia cells.  In simpler terms, it helps the abnormal leukemia cells mature into normal blood cells and reduces their ability to multiply uncontrollably, eventually leading to remission.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Tretinoin (systemic) is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to tretinoin, other retinoids, parabens, or any component of the formulation.

**Interactions:**  Tretinoin can interact with numerous medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

**Warnings:**  Tretinoin carries a boxed warning due to the risk of APL differentiation syndrome and other serious side effects. This necessitates close monitoring by experienced healthcare professionals.  Pregnant women should avoid using this medication due to the high risk of severe fetal abnormalities.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued before starting tretinoin treatment.  Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal conditions should be carefully monitored.


### FAQs

**Q: How is tretinoin (systemic) stored?**
A: Store tretinoin capsules at room temperature, away from moisture and light.


**Q: How long does it take to see results from tretinoin treatment?**
A: The time to remission varies considerably among patients. It can take several weeks or months.


**Q: Can I drink alcohol while on tretinoin?**
A:  It's best to consult your physician regarding alcohol consumption while taking tretinoin.  Alcohol may interact with the drug or worsen certain side effects.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately for instructions on what to do if you miss a dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.


**Q: Can I stop taking tretinoin if I feel better?**
A:  No, do not stop taking tretinoin without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely can result in relapse or incomplete remission.
