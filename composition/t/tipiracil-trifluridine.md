# Tipiracil + Trifluridine

**Generic Name:** Tipiracil and Trifluridine (often seen as TAS-102)

**Usage:**  Tipiracil and trifluridine is a combination chemotherapy medication used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in adults who have received at least two prior therapies.  It's specifically indicated for patients whose cancer has progressed after treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapies.

**Side Effects:**  Tipiracil and trifluridine can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), anemia (low red blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), stomatitis (mouth sores), mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes), hand-foot syndrome (pain, swelling, redness of the hands and feet).

* **Serious:**  Severe neutropenia (leading to increased risk of infection), severe diarrhea, severe dehydration, colitis (inflammation of the colon), toxic megacolon (a life-threatening complication of colitis), severe fatigue, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), cardiac toxicity (heart problems).  Some side effects can be life-threatening.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary significantly from person to person.  It's crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to a healthcare provider immediately.


**How it Works:** Trifluridine is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNA synthesis in cancer cells, effectively stopping their growth and replication. Tipiracil is a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor; it prevents the breakdown of trifluridine, increasing its effectiveness and extending its duration of action in the body.  The combination of these two drugs enhances their anti-cancer effects.
