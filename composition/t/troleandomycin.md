# Troleandomycin
### Generic Name
Troleandomycin

### Usage
Troleandomycin is a macrolide antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract.  These infections can include tonsillitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and pneumonia.  It's important to note that due to its low efficacy and the availability of safer alternatives, troleandomycin is rarely used in current clinical practice.  While it has seen off-label use in steroid-resistant asthma,  this is not a recommended treatment approach.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

For susceptible respiratory infections, the typical oral dosage is 250-500 mg four times daily (QID) for 10 days.  For off-label use in steroid-resistant asthma (not recommended), an initial dosage of 250 mg QID (14 mg/kg/day) might be considered,  gradually reducing the dose weekly until reaching 250 mg/day, or even 250 mg every other day if clinically stable.  However,  it's crucial to reiterate that this off-label use is not generally advised due to limited efficacy and the risk of side effects.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

For susceptible respiratory infections in children, the usual oral dose is 6.6-11 mg/kg/day (125-250 mg) given four times daily for 10 days.  Off-label use in steroid-resistant asthma (ages 7-13) might involve an initial dose of 14 mg/kg/day divided into three doses (maximum 1g/day), gradually decreasing over four weeks.  Again,  off-label use is discouraged due to safety concerns and the availability of more suitable alternatives.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Troleandomycin should be used with extreme caution in patients with these conditions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Allergic reactions
* Abdominal pain
* Superinfection (secondary infection due to disruption of normal flora)


Less common but serious side effects:

* Unusual bleeding or bruising
* Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol)
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Cholestatic jaundice (jaundice due to bile duct blockage)
* Fever
* Hepatic dysfunction (liver damage)
* Allergic hepatitis (liver inflammation due to allergy)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare, serious skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare, life-threatening skin reaction)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Vaginal yeast infection


If any adverse effects occur,  consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Troleandomycin is a macrolide antibiotic that works by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria.  This binding interferes with the process of protein synthesis within the bacterial cell, ultimately inhibiting bacterial growth and leading to their death.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Troleandomycin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to troleandomycin or a history of troleandomycin-induced liver dysfunction.

**Interactions:** Troleandomycin can interact significantly with many other medications, potentially increasing their serum concentrations and the risk of adverse effects.  These interactions are particularly important with:  calcium channel blockers, pimozide (increased cardiotoxicity risk), astemizole, terfenadine, disopyramide, diltiazem, verapamil, mizolastine, and cisapride (increased arrhythmia risk), alfentanil (increased respiratory depression risk), rifampicin (increased hepatotoxicity risk), oral contraceptives (increased pruritus and cholestatic jaundice risk), and ergot alkaloids (increased ergotism risk).  Consult a healthcare professional about potential drug interactions before taking troleandomycin with any other medication.


**Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, and in those with a history of arrhythmias.  Pregnancy category C means that it may pose risks to a developing fetus. Troleandomycin is excreted in breast milk and should be used cautiously during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take troleandomycin with food?** A:  No, it's best taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal.

* **Q: How should I store troleandomycin?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is troleandomycin safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use is generally discouraged due to the risk of side effects, particularly liver damage.  It is rarely used for extended periods.

* **Q: Are there any alternatives to troleandomycin?** A: Yes, many other antibiotics are available and are generally preferred due to their superior safety profile and efficacy.  Your doctor can discuss suitable alternatives.

Troleandomycin is rarely prescribed due to safety and efficacy concerns; more modern and safer antibiotics are generally preferred.
