# Tilbroquinol
### Generic Name
Tilbroquinol

### Usage
Tilbroquinol is a halogenated hydroxyquinoline antiprotozoal medication.  Its primary use was in the treatment of amebiasis (infection caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*). It also demonstrated some effectiveness against *Vibrio cholerae*, the bacterium responsible for cholera.  However, it's crucial to understand that Tilbroquinol is no longer commercially available due to safety concerns.

### Dosage
Because Tilbroquinol is no longer available, providing specific dosage information would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous.  Any information found elsewhere should be disregarded as it may be outdated and unreliable.  If you require treatment for amebiasis or cholera, consult a healthcare professional for current and safe treatment options.

### Side Effects
Since Tilbroquinol is no longer used, a comprehensive list of side effects is not readily available and shouldn't be relied upon from outdated sources.  The primary reason for its withdrawal from the market was the potential for serious liver damage (hepatotoxicity).  Other side effects may have included gastrointestinal upset, but this information is unreliable without access to complete, updated clinical trial data.

### How it Works
Tilbroquinol's antiprotozoal activity stems from its ability to chelate (bind to) essential metals. These metals are crucial for various enzymatic reactions within protozoa, including DNA synthesis. By depriving these organisms of necessary metals, Tilbroquinol inhibits their growth and replication, ultimately leading to their elimination from the body.

### Precautions
Given that Tilbroquinol is no longer available, any precautions associated with its use are irrelevant for current medical practice.  Healthcare professionals have access to safer and more effective alternatives for treating amebiasis and cholera.
