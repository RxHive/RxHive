# Tetracaine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Tetracaine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage

Tetracaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is a local anesthetic used to numb the eye temporarily.  Its primary use is for short procedures that require rapid onset of eye numbing, such as tonometry (measuring eye pressure), or other brief ophthalmologic examinations.  It's also used for minor surgical procedures of the eye and, in higher doses, for more extensive procedures like cataract extraction, though other anesthetics might be preferred for longer procedures.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Ophthalmic):**

* **Short procedures (e.g., tonometry):** 1-2 drops of a 0.5% solution in the affected eye(s) immediately before the procedure.
* **Minor surgical procedures:** 1-2 drops of a 0.5% solution every 5-10 minutes, up to a maximum of 3 doses.
* **Prolonged anesthesia (e.g., cataract extraction):** 1-2 drops of a 0.5% solution every 5-10 minutes, up to a maximum of 5 doses.

**Pediatric Dosage (Ophthalmic):**

* Infants, children, and adolescents: 1 drop of 0.5% solution as needed, with the initial drop administered just before the procedure or examination.  Dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's age and needs.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor for guidance if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Transient burning or stinging in the eyes, lacrimation (tearing), photophobia (light sensitivity), conjunctival erythema (redness of the conjunctiva â€“ the membrane lining the eyelid and eye), and chemosis (swelling of the conjunctiva).
* **Less Common but Serious:** Hypersensitivity reactions (including corneal hypersensitivity reactions, which can be severe).  These can manifest as keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), epithelial defects, and in severe cases, permanent corneal damage.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tetracaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking sodium channels in nerve cells.  These sodium channels are essential for transmitting pain signals. By blocking these channels, tetracaine prevents pain signals from reaching the brain, resulting in a numbing effect.  This temporary numbness allows ophthalmologic procedures to be performed with minimal discomfort.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Tetracaine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to tetracaine or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with known allergies have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease and in breastfeeding women. The excretion of tetracaine in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tetracaine may interact with sulfonamides, aminosalicylic acid, anticholinesterases, and suxamethonium.  Concomitant use should be avoided or carefully managed under medical supervision.
* **General Precautions:**  The ophthalmic solution is for topical use only; it should not be injected or used intraocularly. Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface to prevent contamination.  Patients should avoid touching their eyes for 10-20 minutes after administration to prevent accidental injury.  Soft contact lenses should be removed before administration and reinserted at least 15 minutes afterward if the formulation contains benzalkonium chloride. Prolonged use can lead to corneal toxicity.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the numbing effect last?** A: The duration of the anesthetic effect depends on the concentration used and the procedure; it's typically short-acting.

* **Q: Can I use this medication if I have allergies?** A:  If you have known allergies, you should inform your healthcare professional before using tetracaine.  It's contraindicated in patients with known allergies to tetracaine or its components.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get too much in my eye?** A: If you accidentally use more than the recommended dose, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

* **Q: Is it safe to use tetracaine during pregnancy?** A:  Tetracaine is classified as Category C during pregnancy, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risks, under strict medical supervision.
