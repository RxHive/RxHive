# Tetanus Immune Globulin
### Generic Name
Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG)

### Usage
Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG) is a medicine containing antibodies against the tetanus toxin, a poison produced by the bacterium *Clostridium tetani*.  Its primary use is as a preventative measure (prophylaxis) against tetanus. This is particularly crucial for individuals with incomplete or uncertain tetanus immunization following a wound, injury, or burn.  TIG is also used in the treatment of active tetanus infections, where the toxin has already begun to affect the body.  The goal in both prophylactic and treatment settings is to neutralize the tetanus toxin before it causes serious harm.

### Dosage

Dosage of TIG depends heavily on the patient's age, weight, and the specific situation (prophylaxis versus treatment, wound type, immunization history).  It's always administered by intramuscular (IM) injection.  Never administer intravenously.

**Adults:**

* **Prophylaxis (preventative):**  For clean, minor wounds in individuals with incomplete immunization (<3 doses or uncertain status), a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is given; TIG is typically not needed.  For all other wounds (contaminated, deep, etc.) in individuals with incomplete immunization, a dose of 250 units of TIG is given along with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.  In adults with complete immunization (â‰¥3 doses), TIG is generally not needed unless the last dose was more than 5-10 years prior and the wound is not clean or minor.

* **Treatment (active tetanus):** 3000-6000 units are administered.  A portion of the dose is ideally infiltrated around the wound.


**Children:**

* **Prophylaxis:** For children under 7 years old, the dose is 250 units or 4 units/kg (whichever is greater). For children 7 years and older, the dose is typically 250 units, but might increase to 500 units if there's been a delay in treatment or a high-risk wound.
* **Treatment:**  The dosage is the same as for adults, adjusted based on the child's age and condition.

**Important Note:**  These are general guidelines. A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose based on a thorough assessment of the individual's situation and medical history.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Local soreness, pain, or tenderness at the injection site.
* Increased body temperature (fever).

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Nephrotic syndrome (kidney disorder)

Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.  Even common side effects warrant contacting a doctor if they are severe or persistent.

### How it Works

TIG works by providing passive immunity.  It delivers pre-formed antibodies (proteins that fight off specific invaders) directly into the bloodstream. These antibodies specifically target and neutralize the tetanus toxin, preventing it from binding to nerve cells and causing paralysis. This offers immediate protection, unlike vaccines which take time to build up immunity.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** TIG is derived from human plasma, so there's a risk of allergic reactions, ranging from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis. Individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins should exercise extreme caution.  Those with isolated IgA deficiency should also be carefully monitored.
* **Interactions with other drugs:** TIG might interfere with the effectiveness of live vaccines.  It's important to inform the doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, currently being taken.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** TIG is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. While it's generally recommended for pregnant women who need tetanus prophylaxis, its effects on the developing fetus are not fully understood. It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk.  Consult a physician if pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Other conditions:** Individuals with bleeding disorders or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) should be carefully monitored.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection from TIG last?** A:  The protection is temporary, usually lasting only a few weeks.

* **Q: Can TIG be given to infants?** A: Yes, TIG is used in infants and children according to adjusted dosage guidelines.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to discuss appropriate actions.

* **Q: How should I store TIG?** A: TIG should be stored as directed by your doctor or pharmacist, typically refrigerated.

* **Q: Are there any long-term side effects?** A: Serious long-term side effects are rare.  However, it's essential to report any concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider.
