# Tranilast (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Tranilast (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Tranilast ophthalmic solution is primarily used to treat allergic conjunctivitis.  This is an inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye) caused by an allergic reaction.  It's effective in reducing the symptoms associated with this condition.  Currently, it does not have widely established secondary uses beyond allergic conjunctivitis.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults with allergic conjunctivitis is 1-2 drops of 0.5% Tranilast ophthalmic suspension instilled into each affected eye four times a day (QID) while awake.  For severe cases, additional or alternative therapy might be necessary.  Prolonged use should be avoided.  

Dosage information for children is not readily available in standard resources.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage and treatment for children.

No dosage adjustments are specified for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  However, it's crucial to inform your doctor about any existing liver or kidney conditions before starting this medication.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Contact dermatitis (around the eye)
* Blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids)
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva)
* Eyelid edema (swelling)
* Eye irritation
* Eye itching (pruritus)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are not comprehensively detailed in readily available information.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after using Tranilast ophthalmic solution, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Tranilast works by suppressing the release of chemical mediators from mast cells.  Mast cells are immune cells involved in allergic reactions.  These mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, are responsible for the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, including itching, redness, and swelling. By inhibiting their release, Tranilast helps to reduce the inflammation and alleviate the symptoms.


### Precautions
Tranilast ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to tranilast or any component of the formulation.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Tranilast during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  It should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. If ophthalmic medication is necessary during pregnancy, the lowest effective dose should be used, along with punctal occlusion (closing the tear duct) to minimize fetal exposure.  Breastfeeding mothers should consult their healthcare provider before using Tranilast.

* **General Precautions:** This medication is for ophthalmic (eye) use only. Avoid touching the tip of the container to the eye or other surfaces to prevent contamination. Wipe away any excess solution.  Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
