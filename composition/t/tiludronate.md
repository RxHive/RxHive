# Tiludronate
### Generic Name
Tiludronate

### Usage
Tiludronate is primarily used to treat Paget's disease of bone.  This condition causes excessive bone breakdown and reformation, leading to weakened and deformed bones. Tiludronate works by slowing down the breakdown of bone, allowing for healthier bone growth.  It's specifically targeted at managing the symptoms and slowing the progression of Paget's disease. There are currently no other approved uses for tiludronate.


### Dosage

**Adults:** For Paget's disease, the typical adult dosage is 400 mg orally once daily for three months.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of tiludronate in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-90 mL/min), no specific dosage adjustment is provided, but caution is advised.  Tiludronate is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Diarrhea

**Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus)
* Gastric ulcer
* Gastrointestinal inflammation
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Bone fracture (including atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures)
* Dermatological reactions (skin rashes)
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Ostealgia (bone pain)
* Skin rash
* Vertigo (spinning sensation)
* Weakness

**Serious but Less Common:**  Osteonecrosis of the jaw (bone death in the jaw) and osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal (bone death in the ear canal) are serious, albeit rare, side effects associated with bisphosphonates like tiludronate.  These risks are generally higher with longer durations of treatment.  

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Tiludronate is a bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates work by attaching to the bone's surface and inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for breaking down bone. By reducing bone resorption (breakdown), tiludronate indirectly promotes bone formation and helps to improve bone strength and reduce bone pain associated with Paget's disease.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Tiludronate is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to tiludronate, other bisphosphonates, or any component of the formulation
* Inability to sit or stand upright for at least 30 minutes after taking the medication (to reduce risk of esophageal irritation)
* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels)
* Esophageal abnormalities that delay emptying (such as strictures or achalasia)
* Juvenile Paget's disease


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of musculoskeletal pain, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures, and gastrointestinal mucosal irritation.
* Use with caution in patients with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), esophageal disease, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers.
* Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
* Avoid concomitant use with indomethacin, aminoglycosides, antacids, calcium salts, magnesium-containing laxatives, and iron. These medications can affect tiludronate's absorption or increase the risk of side effects.
* Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.
* Patients should be advised of the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene, including regular dental check-ups.


### FAQs

**Q: How should I take tiludronate?**

A: Take tiludronate with 6-8 ounces of plain water, at least two hours before or after food, antacids, calcium, or vitamin D supplements.  Stay upright for at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet to avoid esophageal irritation.  Swallow the tablet whole; do not chew or crush it.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.


**Q: How should I store tiludronate?**

A: Store tiludronate tablets in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of the reach of children.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects of tiludronate?**

A:  Long-term use of bisphosphonates has been associated with rare but serious side effects.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is important to assess your response to treatment and address any potential concerns.

**Q: Can I take tiludronate if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?**

A: Tiludronate is categorized as pregnancy category C. The safety of using this medication during pregnancy has not been fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor if you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
