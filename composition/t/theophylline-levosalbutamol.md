# Theophylline + Levosalbutamol
### Generic Name
Theophylline + Levosalbutamol

**Note:**  Theophylline + Levosalbutamol is a combination medication.  Information below addresses each component separately as their actions and precautions differ.  Always consult a physician or pharmacist before using this medication, especially if you are already taking other medications. This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.


### Usage

**Theophylline:** This is a bronchodilator, primarily used to treat and prevent wheezing and shortness of breath associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.

**Levosalbutamol:** This is also a bronchodilator, a beta-2 agonist, which quickly relaxes the muscles in the airways, relieving symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness associated with asthma, COPD, and other reversible airway obstructive diseases. It acts faster than theophylline.


### Dosage

Dosage for Theophylline + Levosalbutamol combinations will vary significantly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup, inhaler), the manufacturer, and the individual patient's needs.  There is no single standard dosage.  **This information should NOT be used for self-medication.** A doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on factors like age, weight, severity of the condition, and other medications the patient is taking.

**Theophylline:** Dosage is typically individualized through blood level monitoring to ensure optimal therapeutic effect while avoiding toxicity.  Oral dosages are commonly in the range of several hundred milligrams per day, divided into doses.  IV administration requires careful monitoring and is generally done in a hospital setting.  Pediatric dosages vary significantly with age and weight.

**Levosalbutamol:** Dosage instructions will vary depending on the form (e.g., inhaler, nebulizer solution).  Inhalers typically involve a specific number of puffs per dose, while nebulizers use a specific solution volume. Pediatric dosages are significantly lower than adult doses. Always adhere strictly to the physician's prescription and instructions.


### Side Effects

**Theophylline:**

* Common: Headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, insomnia, restlessness, increased urination.
* Less Common but Serious:  Heart palpitations, seizures, irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias), low blood pressure.

**Levosalbutamol:**

* Common: Tremors, headache, muscle cramps, nervousness, increased heart rate.
* Less Common but Serious:  Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia), paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties).


**Both Theophylline and Levosalbutamol:**  If you experience any serious side effects, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, or allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

**Theophylline:** This medication works by relaxing the smooth muscles around the airways in the lungs.  It does this by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase, which leads to increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a molecule that promotes relaxation of the airway muscles.

**Levosalbutamol:** This medication binds to beta-2 receptors on the smooth muscle cells of the airways.  This activation leads to a cascade of events that ultimately result in relaxation of the airway muscles, opening them up and making breathing easier.


### Precautions

**Theophylline:**

* **Interactions:** Many medications interact with theophylline, potentially affecting its levels in the blood.  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  This is crucial as interactions can lead to theophylline toxicity.
* **Contraindications:**  Theophylline should be used cautiously in individuals with heart disease, liver disease, peptic ulcers, or hyperthyroidism.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Levosalbutamol:**

* **Interactions:** Some interactions with other medications are possible.  Consult your physician about potential interactions.
* **Contraindications:** Use with caution in patients with heart conditions or individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to beta-agonists.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under strict medical supervision.

**For both medications:** Always inform your healthcare provider of any allergies or pre-existing conditions before taking Theophylline + Levosalbutamol.
