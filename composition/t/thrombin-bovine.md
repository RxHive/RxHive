# Thrombin, Bovine
### Generic Name
Thrombin, Bovine

### Usage
Thrombin, bovine, is a hemostatic agent.  Its primary use is to help control bleeding from capillaries and small venules where the bleeding site is directly accessible. This makes it useful in various surgical and medical procedures where minor bleeding is a concern, such as plastic surgery, dental extractions, and skin grafting.  While primarily used for minor bleeding, it may also be applied topically in cases of more severe hemorrhage, but always under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

**Control of Hemorrhage:**

Dosage varies depending on the severity of the bleeding.  The medication is applied topically.

* **Mild/moderate hemorrhage:**  For procedures like plastic surgery, dental extractions, or skin grafting, a concentration of 100 IU/mL is typically applied as needed.  This might involve using a powder for solution (available in 5000 IU and 20000 IU vials) reconstituted appropriately.

* **Severe hemorrhage:** In cases of profuse bleeding, such as from abraded surfaces of the liver or spleen, a much higher concentration of 1000 IU/mL may be used, again applied topically as needed, with the same preparation options as above.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of thrombin, bovine, in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.


### Side Effects

* **Immunologic reactions:**  Hypersensitivity reactions and antibody development are rare but possible.  These can range from mild reactions to serious complications.

* **Serious but less common side effects:** Severe bleeding and thrombosis (blood clot formation) are possible, although uncommon. These are more likely with repeated use.  These complications may result from the formation of antibodies against bovine thrombin and/or Factor V which can potentially cross-react with human Factor V.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Thrombin, bovine, is a protein derived from bovine (cattle) blood.  It acts by directly converting fibrinogen, a blood protein, into fibrin. Fibrin forms a mesh-like structure that traps blood cells, leading to clot formation and the cessation of bleeding.  Unlike some other clotting agents, it doesn't require additional physiological factors to initiate the clotting process.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Thrombin, bovine, should not be used in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to thrombin or bovine-derived products.  It is absolutely contraindicated for direct injection into the circulatory system; this can lead to widespread intravascular clotting and potentially death. It's also not appropriate for treating massive or brisk arterial bleeding.

* **Increased Risk:**  Repeated use increases the risk of antibody formation against bovine thrombin and/or Factor V, potentially leading to abnormal bleeding or thrombosis.

* **Warnings:**  The use of topical bovine thrombin has been associated with abnormalities in hemostasis, ranging from mild changes in coagulation tests to severe bleeding or thrombosis (rarely fatal). Patients with a history of coagulation disorders should be carefully monitored.  Consult a hematologist or coagulation specialist immediately if there are any signs of bleeding or thrombosis after use.  Patients who develop antibodies should never be re-exposed to bovine thrombin.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Thrombin, bovine, is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully established.  Whether it's excreted in breast milk is unknown. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully weighed against the potential benefits and risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is thrombin, bovine, applied?** A: It's applied topically to the bleeding site.  It may be used as a dry powder or reconstituted as a solution, depending on the product formulation.

* **Q: Can I use thrombin, bovine, for deep wounds or internal bleeding?** A: No, thrombin, bovine is strictly for topical application to minor bleeding on accessible surfaces. It is dangerous to inject or use it for internal or deep wounds.

* **Q: How should I store thrombin, bovine?** A:  Storage instructions should be found on the product labeling, but generally involve storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

* **Q:  What should I do if I have a reaction to thrombin, bovine?** A:  Stop using the product immediately and seek medical attention.  Describe the symptoms experienced clearly to the healthcare professional.
