# Tobramycin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Tobramycin Ophthalmic and Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Ophthalmic

**Note:**  Tobramycin and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose are combined in ophthalmic (eye) solutions.  They are not usually combined systemically (e.g., by injection or orally). This answer focuses on the ophthalmic combination.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific information about your medication.

**Usage:**

This combination is used to treat bacterial infections of the eye, such as conjunctivitis (pinkeye). The tobramycin is the antibiotic that fights the bacteria, while the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is a lubricating agent that helps to soothe the eye and prolong the contact time of the tobramycin with the infected area.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye(s)
* Temporary blurred vision
* Eye redness
* Itching
* Eye discharge


More serious, but rare side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Eye pain
* Changes in vision
* Corneal damage (rare)


**How it Works:**

* **Tobramycin:** This aminoglycoside antibiotic works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells, leading to their death. It's effective against a range of gram-negative bacteria commonly causing eye infections.

* **Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC):** This is a viscous polymer that acts as a lubricant and thickener. It helps to keep the tobramycin solution in contact with the eye's surface for a longer period, enhancing its effectiveness and providing relief from dryness and irritation.


**FAQs:**

* **How often should I use it?**  Follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.  Typical regimens involve applying one or more drops into the affected eye(s) several times a day.

* **How long will it take to work?** You may see improvement within a few days, but complete resolution of the infection may take a week or longer. Continue using the medication as prescribed even if you feel better.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Can I wear contact lenses while using this medication?**  Generally, it's best to avoid wearing contact lenses while using this medication. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific advice.

* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
