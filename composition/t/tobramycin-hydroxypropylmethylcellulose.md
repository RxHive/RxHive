# Tobramycin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
### Generic Name
Tobramycin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Topical)


### Usage

This combination medication is used topically (applied to the surface) to treat bacterial infections of the eye, specifically conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other similar conditions. Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that effectively targets a wide range of bacteria commonly causing eye infections. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acts as a lubricant and helps the tobramycin solution stay in contact with the infected area for a longer duration, improving its effectiveness.  While primarily used for eye infections, this specific combination is not typically used for other bacterial infections elsewhere in the body.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will be found on the product packaging and should always be followed precisely.  Generally, a typical adult dosage involves one or two drops instilled into the affected eye(s) every 4 to 6 hours. Children’s dosages will be determined by their doctor based on age and the severity of the infection.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Frequency:**  Do not exceed the prescribed dosage or frequency. More isn’t better and could potentially lead to unwanted side effects.
* **Duration:** Continue using the medication for the full course prescribed by your doctor, even if symptoms improve. Stopping early can allow the infection to return.
* **Forms:** This combination is usually available as an ophthalmic solution (eye drops). There are no oral or IV forms.
* **Application:** Gently pull down your lower eyelid to create a pocket and instill the drops. Avoid touching the tip of the dropper to your eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Burning or stinging sensation in the eye upon application, temporary blurred vision, eye redness.  These side effects are usually mild and temporary.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe eye pain, changes in vision, increased eye discharge, allergic reactions (such as swelling, rash, difficulty breathing).  If any of these occur, discontinue use and contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Tobramycin, the antibiotic component, works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to produce essential proteins for survival.  This leads to bacterial cell death and helps clear the infection. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is a thickening agent that prolongs the contact time of tobramycin with the infected eye tissue.  This extended contact improves the antibiotic's effectiveness and reduces the frequency of application needed.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to aminoglycoside antibiotics (like gentamicin, amikacin) or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose should not use this medication.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying the eye drops. Wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting lenses.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as there may be potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  While generally considered safe for topical use,  a doctor should weigh the benefits against potential risks.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Temporary blurred vision may occur after application.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until vision clears.
