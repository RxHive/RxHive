# Tricholine Citrate + Sorbitol

There is no widely recognized or established generic combination medication called "Tricholine Citrate + Sorbitol".  It's possible this is:

* **An inaccurate or incomplete name:**  There might be a typo, or a different, more precise chemical name is needed.  "Tricholine Citrate" itself isn't a standard pharmaceutical term.  Choline citrate is a common supplement, but a "tri" prefix is unusual.
* **A custom formulation:** It could be a unique blend made by a specific compounding pharmacy or manufacturer, not listed in standard databases.
* **A misspelling:**  One or both of the components might be misspelled.

To get accurate information, you would need to provide:

* **The exact brand name (if any):** This would allow for a search in pharmaceutical databases.
* **The full ingredient list:**  This should list all components and their amounts.
* **The source of the information:** Knowing where you encountered this name will help determine its validity.


Therefore, I cannot provide the requested details in the specified format without more precise information about the medication in question.  If you can supply the missing details, I can try to provide a more accurate and helpful response.
