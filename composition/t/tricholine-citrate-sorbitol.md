# Tricholine Citrate + Sorbitol
### Generic Name
Tricholine Citrate + Sorbitol

### Usage
Tricholine citrate and sorbitol combination is primarily used as a laxative to treat constipation.  It works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and making it easier to pass. This combination is often preferred because tricholine citrate contributes to stool softening while sorbitol adds to the osmotic effect, enhancing the laxative action.  While primarily used for occasional constipation, it might be considered for short-term use in managing constipation associated with specific medical conditions under a doctor's supervision.  It's crucial to understand that this combination is not intended for long-term use as a regular laxative.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on age and the severity of constipation.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  There isn't a standardized dosage across all formulations, as the concentrations of tricholine citrate and sorbitol can differ.  Therefore, always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate dosage instructions.  Generally:

* **Oral:**  Dosage instructions for oral formulations will be clearly indicated on the product label and may vary based on the concentration of each ingredient.  Adults typically take a certain volume or number of tablets/capsules, as directed. Children's dosage is significantly lower and must be determined based on age and weight, strictly following instructions on the packaging or from a healthcare provider.

* **IV (Intravenous):** This combination is *not* administered intravenously.  Intravenous administration is not appropriate for this type of laxative.  Laxative action relies on the osmotic effect within the gastrointestinal tract.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and can include:

* Abdominal cramping
* Gas
* Bloating
* Diarrhea (in some cases)
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention:

* Severe abdominal pain
* Rectal bleeding
* Dehydration (especially with prolonged use or if you are not drinking enough fluids)
* Electrolyte imbalance (in cases of excessive use)


If you experience any adverse effects, stop using the medication and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works
Tricholine citrate and sorbitol act as osmotic laxatives.  Sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, draws water into the colon, increasing stool bulk and softening it. Tricholine citrate, a choline salt, also contributes to stool softening.  This combined action promotes easier bowel movements. The increased water content in the stool stimulates bowel motility, helping to relieve constipation.
