# Trimethadione
### Generic Name
Trimethadione

### Usage
Trimethadione is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to control petit mal (absence) seizures.  It's specifically indicated for cases where other anti-seizure medications have proven ineffective.  This medication is not a first-line treatment for seizures; it is reserved for those with seizures that haven't responded to other therapies.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Control of petit mal seizures:** The initial oral dose is 0.9 grams per day. This dose is gradually increased by 300 milligrams weekly until seizures are controlled or side effects appear. The maintenance dose is the lowest amount needed to manage seizures.  Typical maintenance doses range from 0.9 to 2.4 grams daily, divided into 3 or 4 doses (300-600 mg three or four times daily).


**Children:**

* **Control of petit mal seizures:** The usual oral dose is 0.3 to 0.9 grams daily, divided into 3 or 4 doses.  The exact dosage will be determined by a physician based on the child's weight and response to treatment.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Trimethadione is not recommended for use in patients with severe liver or kidney impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Gastric distress
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Malaise
* Insomnia
* Vertigo
* Headache
* Paraesthesias (abnormal sensations like tingling or numbness)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Increased irritability
* Personality changes
* Bleeding (gums, nose, vagina)
* Blood disorders (neutropenia, leukopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia)
* Skin rashes (ranging from acneiform to severe exfoliative dermatitis or erythema multiforme)
* Hiccups
* Anorexia
* Weight loss
* Hair loss
* Changes in blood pressure
* Kidney problems (albuminuria, nephrosis)
* Liver problems (hepatitis)
* Lupus-like syndrome
* Myasthenia-like syndrome
* Eye problems (hemeralopia, photophobia, diplopia)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or unusual ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Trimethadione is a dione-type anticonvulsant that works by reducing the flow of calcium ions into specific brain cells (thalamic neurons). This action stabilizes the electrical activity of these cells, preventing the abnormal, rapid firing that causes absence seizures. By reducing the abnormal rhythmicity in the thalamus and its communication with the cortex, trimethadione helps to control the characteristic spike-and-wave patterns seen in EEG recordings during absence seizures.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Trimethadione is contraindicated in individuals with known allergies to the drug.
* **Blood Disorders:**  Trimethadione can significantly increase the risk of developing blood disorders, including potentially fatal aplastic anemia. Regular blood tests are crucial during treatment.
* **Liver and Kidney Problems:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease. It's contraindicated in those with severe impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Trimethadione use during pregnancy is associated with a high risk of birth defects and should only be considered when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Effective contraception is necessary.  The safety of Trimethadione during breastfeeding is unknown.
* **Other Medications:**  Potential interactions with other drugs exist.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking Trimethadione.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Drowsiness is a common side effect. Refrain from driving or operating machinery if affected.
* **Sudden Discontinuation:** Abruptly stopping Trimethadione can trigger a serious condition called petit mal status.  Always discontinue the medication gradually under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
