# Theophylline + Vitamin B

It's important to note that there is **no standard or commonly available generic medication combining theophylline and vitamin B.**  Theophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat asthma and COPD, while vitamin B encompasses a group of different vitamins (B1, B2, B3, etc.) each with distinct roles in the body.  Combining them in a single medication is not a typical practice.  Prescribing theophylline and a B vitamin supplement would be done separately if a doctor deemed it necessary.

Therefore, I cannot provide details in the requested format for a non-existent combined medication.  I can, however, provide information on theophylline and B vitamins separately:


**Theophylline:**

**Generic Name:** Theophylline

**Usage:**  Treatment and prevention of wheezing and shortness of breath associated with asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema.

**Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, heart palpitations, seizures (at high doses), increased urination.

**How it Works:**  Relaxes the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe.  It works by blocking the action of adenosine, a chemical that constricts airways.

**Side Effects:** Generally mild and rare with recommended dosages. Some potential side effects depend on the specific vitamin and dosage, such as flushing (niacin), tingling (B6), and digestive upset.

**How it Works:**  Acts as coenzymes in numerous metabolic processes.
