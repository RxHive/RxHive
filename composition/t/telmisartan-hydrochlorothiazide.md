# Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide

### Usage

Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by combining two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic.  By working together, these components provide a more effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone.  This combination is often prescribed for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication.  While its primary use is hypertension, it may be considered in managing some cases of chronic heart failure as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, usually in conjunction with other heart failure medications.  However, it's crucial to remember that this combination is not a first-line treatment for heart failure and should only be used under the strict guidance of a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage of Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide varies depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment.  It's always administered orally. A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose.  There is no universally accepted pediatric dosage, and its use in children is generally not recommended.  The typical adult starting dose is usually one tablet once daily.  However, the doctor may adjust this based on blood pressure readings.  Higher doses are possible but only under the supervision of a physician.  It's important to take this medication exactly as prescribed and not to adjust the dosage without consulting a doctor.  Missed doses should be taken as soon as remembered, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Different formulations exist (e.g., tablets containing varying strengths of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide), and the specific dosage instructions will depend on the prescription.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps
* Dry mouth

Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Kidney problems
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Liver problems


If any of these side effects occur, particularly the more serious ones, it's vital to seek immediate medical attention.  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.


### How it Works

Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels, thereby increasing blood pressure.  By blocking angiotensin II, telmisartan allows blood vessels to relax and widen, reducing blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic (water pill) that increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through urine.  This reduction in fluid volume contributes to lowering blood pressure. The combination of these two mechanisms provides a synergistic effect, leading to a more substantial and controlled reduction in blood pressure.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients with severe liver or kidney disease, anuria (absence of urine production),  and those who are allergic to either telmisartan, hydrochlorothiazide, or any other component of the medication.  It should also be avoided in pregnant and breastfeeding women.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, including other blood pressure medications, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and lithium.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Specific Warnings:**  Elderly patients and individuals with impaired kidney or liver function may require dose adjustments or closer monitoring.  Patients with diabetes or gout should use this medication cautiously under medical supervision.  The medication may cause dizziness or lightheadedness; caution is advised when driving or operating machinery.
