# Telmisartan + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**

Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's often prescribed when a single medication isn't enough to control blood pressure effectively.  The telmisartan component is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and the hydrochlorothiazide component is a thiazide diuretic.  By working together, they lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Muscle cramps
* Dry mouth
* Cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension) â€“ especially when starting the medication or increasing the dose
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* Changes in liver function tests
* Elevated blood sugar levels
* Dehydration

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Telmisartan (ARB):** Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking this hormone, telmisartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.

* **Hydrochlorothiazide (Thiazide Diuretic):** Increases the amount of salt and water excreted by the kidneys. This reduces the volume of fluid in the blood, which in turn lowers blood pressure.


The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more potent and effective blood pressure reduction compared to either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide with other medications?**  A:  You should inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications may interact negatively with Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide.
