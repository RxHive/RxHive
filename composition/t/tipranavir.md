# Tipranavir
### Generic Name
Tipranavir

### Usage
Tipranavir is a protease inhibitor used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children (aged 2 years and older) who have already received antiretroviral therapy and whose HIV-1 strains are resistant to multiple other protease inhibitors.  It's crucial to understand that Tipranavir is **not** recommended for use in patients who are newly diagnosed with HIV.  Its use is restricted to those with treatment experience and resistance to other options.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Tipranavir is no longer recommended for initial HIV treatment according to the 2019 HHS guidelines.  Its use is reserved for specific situations of multi-drug resistant HIV.

**Adults:** The usual adult dose is 500 mg twice daily (BID), always given in combination with ritonavir 200 mg BID.

**Children (aged ≥2 years):**  Dosing for children is weight-based or body surface area (BSA)-based and requires careful monitoring by a physician.  

* **Weight-based:** Tipranavir 14 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) with ritonavir 6 mg/kg (maximum 200 mg) BID.  If side effects occur and the virus isn't resistant to many protease inhibitors, the dose might be lowered to Tipranavir 12 mg/kg with ritonavir 5 mg/kg BID, but adult maximum doses should never be exceeded.
* **BSA-based:** Tipranavir 375 mg/m² (maximum 500 mg) with ritonavir 150 mg/m² (maximum 200 mg) BID.  Similarly, if side effects occur and resistance is limited, the dose can be lowered to Tipranavir 290 mg/m² with ritonavir 115 mg/m² BID, but without exceeding adult maximums.


**Administration:** Tipranavir capsules should be swallowed whole; do not open or chew them.  The administration with food may vary depending on whether ritonavir is given as a tablet or capsule/solution. Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Increased triglycerides and cholesterol levels
* Increased liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including hepatitis and liver failure
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
*  Changes in body fat distribution (lipodystrophy)
* Severe allergic reactions


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tipranavir is a protease inhibitor.  HIV-1, the virus causing AIDS, uses a protease enzyme to create new virus particles. Tipranavir works by binding to and blocking the activity of this protease.  By inhibiting the protease, Tipranavir prevents the virus from replicating effectively, thus slowing the progression of the disease.  It's important to note that Tipranavir is always used in combination with other antiretrovirals to increase its effectiveness and reduce the risk of resistance development.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tipranavir is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Tipranavir or any of its ingredients, moderate to severe liver impairment, and concurrent use with certain medications (see interactions).  
* **Interactions:** Tipranavir interacts significantly with many other drugs. This includes both increased and decreased effects of other drugs.  It is vital to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.  The use of certain combinations may be contraindicated.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tipranavir is classified as Category C for pregnancy risk.  It's generally not recommended during pregnancy, and breastfeeding is not recommended due to potential HIV transmission and possible adverse effects on the infant. Consult your doctor to discuss the best course of action.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use is contraindicated in moderate to severe liver impairment. Caution is advised in patients with mild liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically required in patients with renal impairment.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I stop taking Tipranavir if I feel better?**

A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug resistance and a faster progression of HIV.  Continue taking Tipranavir as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel well.

**Q: How should I store Tipranavir?**

A: Store Tipranavir as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but do not double the dose.


**Q: Is Tipranavir a cure for HIV?**

A: No, Tipranavir is not a cure for HIV.  It's a part of a combination therapy that helps to manage the infection and improve quality of life.  It is vital to adhere to the prescribed treatment regimen to suppress viral replication.
