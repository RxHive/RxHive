# Terbinafine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Terbinafine (Systemic)

### Usage
Terbinafine is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Its primary use is in onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nails (fingernails and toenails).  It's also effective against several other types of tinea infections, such as tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), tinea corporis (ringworm), and tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp).  While not its primary indication, terbinafine is sometimes used off-label to treat sporotrichosis, a fungal infection affecting the skin and lymphatic system.  The specific type of tinea infection and its severity will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific infection being treated.

* **Onychomycosis:** The typical oral dose is 250 mg once daily. Treatment duration is 6 weeks for fingernail infections and 12 weeks for toenail infections.

* **Sporotrichosis:** The typical oral dose is 500 mg twice daily. Treatment continues for 2-4 weeks *after* all lesions have resolved (which may take 3-6 months).  This is generally used in patients who haven't responded to other treatments like itraconazole.

* **Other Tinea Infections:**  The oral dose is typically 250 mg once daily, but the duration varies (1-6 weeks) based on the specific infection and its severity and may require extension in immunocompromised individuals with slow responses.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Terbinafine is available in granular form for children.  Dosage is weight-based and determined by the specific fungal infection.  Always follow the physicianâ€™s prescription carefully.  Examples include:

* **Tinea capitis (scalp ringworm):**  Dosage varies depending on the child's weight (e.g., 125 mg daily for children under 25 kg, up to 250 mg daily for children over 35 kg). Treatment is typically 6 weeks long.

* **Onychomycosis (nail fungus):**  Dosage varies depending on the child's weight (similar to tinea capitis, but adjusted for nail fungus treatment duration which is 6 to 12 weeks).

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for mild to moderate renal impairment. However, individuals with severe hepatic (liver) impairment should not take terbinafine as it is contraindicated.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Gastrointestinal issues: Diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), changes in taste (dysgeusia), which can be severe.
* Skin reactions: Rash, itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria).
* Liver enzyme abnormalities: Elevated liver enzymes are a potential concern and warrant monitoring.
* Other:  Influenza-like symptoms, changes in vision, respiratory problems like nasal congestion or cough.


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1% of patients, including post-marketing reports):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver failure
* Blood disorders (e.g., agranulocytosis, neutropenia)
* Skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Changes in sense of smell (anosmia)
*  Neurological effects like paresthesia (numbness or tingling)


If any adverse effects occur, especially if severe or persistent, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal. It works by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme crucial for fungal cell membrane production. This leads to a disruption in the fungal cell membrane, ultimately causing the death of the fungus.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Terbinafine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to terbinafine or its components and those with chronic or active liver disease.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Terbinafine can interact with several other medications, affecting their efficacy or causing adverse reactions.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  This is particularly important with codeine, tamoxifen, and several medications metabolized by the liver.

* **Warnings:**  Terbinafine should be used cautiously in individuals with renal impairment and older adults. It's recommended to monitor liver function tests periodically during treatment.


* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Terbinafine is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug, meaning its potential risks to a fetus are unknown.  It's generally not recommended during pregnancy, except in cases where the benefits outweigh the risks.  Terbinafine is excreted in breast milk and is therefore not recommended for use while breastfeeding.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the type and severity of the infection. For nail infections, improvement may not be noticeable for several weeks or months, even after completing treatment.


* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking terbinafine?** A:  While there's no direct interaction between terbinafine and alcohol, excessive alcohol consumption can negatively impact liver function, so moderation is advised.

* **Q: How should I store terbinafine?** A: Store terbinafine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.


* **Q: Can I stop taking terbinafine if my symptoms improve?** A:  No, continue the medication for the prescribed duration, even if your symptoms improve. This is important to ensure complete eradication of the fungus and prevent recurrence.
