# Tetracaine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Tetracaine (Systemic)

### Usage
Tetracaine (systemic) is a local anesthetic primarily used for inducing spinal anesthesia.  This means it numbs a specific area of the body, allowing for surgical procedures or other medical interventions to be performed without pain.  It's particularly useful for procedures lasting 2-3 hours that require anesthesia below the waist.  While its primary use is spinal anesthesia,  it's important to note that this medication is administered only by trained medical professionals in controlled clinical settings.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Spinal Anesthesia):** Dosage depends heavily on the specific procedure, the desired level of anesthesia, and individual patient response.  Always follow the instructions of your anesthesiologist.

* **Perineal anesthesia:** 5 mg (0.5 mL) of a 1% solution, diluted with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), injected at the 4th lumbar interspace.
* **Perineal and lower extremities:** 10 mg (1 mL) of a 1% solution, diluted with CSF, injected at the 3rd or 4th lumbar interspace.
* **Anesthesia extending to the costal margin:** 15-20 mg (1.5-2 mL) of a 1% solution, diluted with CSF, injected at the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th lumbar interspace.  Higher doses (up to 20mg) are rarely used and only in exceptional cases.
* **Low spinal anesthesia (saddle block):** 2-5 mg.

**Pediatric Dosage (Spinal Anesthesia):** Dosage is weight-based and determined by the medical professional.

* **Children weighing 5-15 kg:** 0.3-0.4 mg/kg
* **Children weighing >15 kg:** 0.2-0.3 mg/kg
* **Maximum dose:** Should not exceed the usual adult doses for specific procedures.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided information doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in these situations.


### Side Effects

* Loss of consciousness
* Nervousness
* Seizures
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Urticaria (hives)
* Tremor
* Blurred vision
* Miosis (constricted pupils)
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)

Less common, but serious side effects include:

* Methemoglobinemia (a condition affecting blood oxygen levels)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Hypersensitivity reactions

If you experience any adverse effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Tetracaine is an ester-type local anesthetic. It works by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses.  Specifically, it reduces the permeability of nerve cell membranes to sodium ions, preventing the depolarization necessary for nerve signal conduction. This leads to a loss of sensation in the targeted area.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Tetracaine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to tetracaine, other ester-type anesthetics, aminobenzoic acid, or any component of the formulation. It's also contraindicated in patients for whom spinal anesthesia itself is contraindicated.
* **Increased risk:**  There's an increased risk of methemoglobinemia and tetracaine toxicity (with high doses).
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, abnormal plasma esterase levels, hyperthyroidism, acute illness, debilitation, old age, during pregnancy, and in those with increased intra-abdominal pressure.  It should also be used cautiously in breastfeeding women.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tetracaine may interact with sulfonamides, aminosalicylic acid, anticholinesterases, and suxamethonium. Consult your physician about any medications you are currently taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is tetracaine stored?** A: Tetracaine solutions should be stored under refrigeration and protected from light.

* **Q: Who administers tetracaine?** A: Tetracaine for systemic use (spinal anesthesia) is administered only by trained anesthesiologists or other qualified healthcare professionals in a hospital or clinical setting.

* **Q:  What are the risks associated with tetracaine?** A:  Risks include the side effects listed above, ranging from mild discomfort to serious complications.  The risks are minimized through careful patient selection, appropriate dosage, and close monitoring by medical professionals.

* **Q:  Is tetracaine safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  Tetracaine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, and only if absolutely necessary.  The excretion of tetracaine in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised in breastfeeding mothers.
