# Teneligliptin + Pioglitazone

**Generic Name:** Teneligliptin + Pioglitazone

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It's typically used when diet, exercise, and other oral medications haven't been enough to control blood sugar levels.  It's important to note that this combination is not a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes and is usually prescribed after other options have been tried.  The specific dosage and regimen will be determined by a physician based on individual needs and response.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, teneligliptin + pioglitazone can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Upper respiratory tract infections:** such as colds and the flu.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect for many medications.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):**  Especially if combined with other diabetes medications or if not eating regularly.  Symptoms can include sweating, trembling, dizziness, and confusion.
* **Weight gain:** Pioglitazone, in particular, is known to cause weight gain.
* **Fluid retention (edema):** Swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs.
* **Bone fractures:** Increased risk, particularly in women.
* **Heart failure:**  Pioglitazone can increase the risk of heart failure, especially in patients with a history of heart problems.
* **Bladder cancer:** There is a possible increased risk, though the evidence is not definitive.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through two different mechanisms:

* **Teneligliptin:** This is a DPP-4 inhibitor. It works by increasing the levels of incretin hormones in the body. Incretins are hormones that stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas after eating, and they also suppress the release of glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar).

* **Pioglitazone:** This is a thiazolidinedione (TZD). It works by increasing the sensitivity of your body's cells to insulin.  This means that insulin can work more effectively to lower blood sugar levels.
