# Thyroid desiccated
### Generic Name
Thyroid Desiccated

### Usage
Thyroid desiccated is a medication used to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones.  This underproduction leads to a slowed metabolism, impacting various bodily functions. Thyroid desiccated acts as a replacement for these missing hormones. While primarily used for hypothyroidism of all causes (except transient hypothyroidism during recovery from subacute thyroiditis), it's important to note that it is not the preferred treatment for pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers with hypothyroidism.  More modern and precisely dosed synthetic hormones are generally recommended in these cases.

### Dosage

**Adults (Hypothyroidism):**  Treatment typically begins with a low dose of 30 mg daily, increased gradually by 15 mg every 2-3 weeks as needed.  However, a lower starting dose of 15 mg/day is recommended for patients with longstanding myxedema (severe hypothyroidism), particularly if there's concern about cardiovascular issues. The usual maintenance dose ranges from 60-120 mg daily, resulting in normal serum T4 and T3 levels.  Dosage adjustments should be made within the first four weeks of therapy based on clinical evaluation and blood tests (T4, free T4, and TSH).  The appearance of angina (chest pain) requires dose reduction.  Doses exceeding 180mg/day that fail to show improvement suggest non-compliance or malabsorption.

**Children (Hypothyroidism):** Dosage depends heavily on the child's age and weight. Doses are typically calculated in mg/kg/day, as follows:

* 0-6 months: 4.8-6 mg/kg/day
* 6-12 months: 3.6-4.8 mg/kg/day
* 1-5 years: 3-3.6 mg/kg/day
* 6-12 years: 2.4-3 mg/kg/day
* >12 years: 1.2-1.8 mg/kg/day

**Important Note for Children:** Over-treatment can cause serious problems, including premature closure of growth plates (epiphyses) and craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones) in infants.  Close monitoring is crucial.  Transient hair loss may occur in the first few months.  In newborns and infants, cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from increased suckling can also be a risk.


**Dosage Adjustments for Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not specified in source): Abdominal cramps, alopecia (hair loss), ataxia (loss of coordination), cardiac arrhythmias, chest pain, constipation, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), diarrhea, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fever, headache, heat intolerance, increased appetite, insomnia, menstrual irregularities, myalgia (muscle pain), nervousness, palpitations, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), tremor, vomiting, and weight loss.

Less common but serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Thyroid desiccated contains a mixture of thyroid hormones, primarily T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine).  T3 is the more active hormone, and T4 can be converted into T3 in the body.  These hormones regulate various metabolic processes throughout the body, impacting growth, development, and energy production.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's known that thyroid hormones influence gene expression and protein synthesis, affecting how the body uses energy and builds and repairs tissues.  By replacing missing hormones, thyroid desiccated helps restore normal metabolic function.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Thyroid desiccated is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any component, untreated thyrotoxicosis (overactive thyroid), uncorrected adrenal insufficiency, uncontrolled angina, uncontrolled hypertension, and uncontrolled myocardial infarction.

**Warnings:** Thyroid desiccated can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. It should be used with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and myxedema.

**Interactions:** Concomitant use with midodrine (a blood pressure medication), oral anticoagulants (blood thinners), lithospermum (an herbal remedy), and kelp (a type of seaweed) can lead to adverse interactions and is generally not recommended.  Always inform your physician of all medications and supplements you are taking.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Thyroid desiccated is not the preferred treatment for hypothyroidism during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and safer alternatives are generally recommended.  While it's excreted in breast milk, caution is advised.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Thyroid desiccated with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, to prevent potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Thyroid desiccated?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Thyroid desiccated effective for weight loss?** A: No.  Using thyroid hormone for weight loss is dangerous and can have serious health consequences.
