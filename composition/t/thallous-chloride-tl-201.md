# Thallous Chloride Tl-201
### Generic Name
Thallous Chloride Tl-201

### Usage
Thallous Chloride Tl-201 is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). MPI uses this radioactive tracer to visualize the heart's blood flow, helping diagnose coronary artery disease.  Specifically, it helps identify areas of the heart muscle that aren't receiving enough blood due to narrowed or blocked arteries (ischemia) and areas of permanent heart muscle damage (myocardial infarction, or heart attack).  This is done by comparing images taken at rest and after exercise or the administration of a medication that increases heart rate and blood flow (stress test).  Tl-201 is also used to locate overactive parathyroid glands in patients with high levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone in their blood.

### Dosage
Dosage is individualized and should be the lowest amount needed to obtain clear images.  Administration is always intravenous (IV).

**Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI):**

* **Planar scintigraphy:** 37-74 MBq (1-2 mCi)
* **Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT):** 74-111 MBq (2-3 mCi)

**Parathyroid Hyperactivity Localization:**

* **Planar or SPECT:** 75-130 MBq (2-3.5 mCi)

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Side effects can occur, though their frequency isn't consistently defined in the literature.  Possible side effects include:

* **Cardiovascular:** Cardiac arrhythmias, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), flushing, hypotension (low blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack).
* **Central Nervous System:** Chills
* **Dermatologic:** Diaphoresis (excessive sweating), pruritus (itching), skin rash
* **Gastrointestinal:** Mild diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* **Hypersensitivity:** Anaphylactoid reaction (allergic-like reaction)
* **Neuromuscular and Skeletal:** Tremor
* **Ophthalmic:** Blurred vision, conjunctivitis (pink eye)
* **Respiratory:** Bronchoconstriction (narrowing of airways), dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* **Other:** Fever

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Thallous chloride Tl-201, without a carrier, accumulates in healthy heart muscle tissue. Areas of the heart muscle that are damaged (infarcted) or not receiving sufficient blood (ischemic) will show up as "cold" or less radioactive areas on the images, contrasting with the surrounding healthy tissue. In parathyroid imaging, Tl-201 concentrates in overactive parathyroid glands, allowing them to be identified using a special camera (gamma camera) which detects the radioactivity.

### Precautions
While there are no specific contraindications listed by manufacturers, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events, hypersensitivity reactions, and local injection site reactions.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Thallous chloride Tl-201 crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding mothers should express and discard breast milk for at least two weeks after administration. Close contact with the infant should be minimized if the dose administered results in a dose greater than 1 mSv to the infant.

* **Drug Interactions:** Medications that affect myocardial blood flow or potassium uptake may alter the distribution of Tl-201 in the body.

* **General Precautions:**  This medication is for intravenous use only. Extravasation (leakage from the vein) is a risk, so proper vein access must be confirmed before injection.  Appropriate handling and disposal measures are necessary due to the radioactive nature of the medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for the medication to work?**  A: The time to image depends on the type of study.  For resting MPI, imaging begins 10-20 minutes after injection. For stress MPI, imaging starts within 10 minutes of injection, given at peak stress. For parathyroid imaging, the injection is timed relative to other imaging agents.

* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A:  Follow the manufacturer's storage instructions carefully as it involves a radioactive substance.

* **Q: Are there any special dietary instructions before the procedure?** A:  For myocardial perfusion imaging, fasting is typically recommended.

* **Q:  What happens after the injection?** A: After injection, you may be asked to exercise (stress test) depending on the purpose of the scan.  Rest and imaging will then follow.

* **Q: How long will the radioactivity remain in my body?** A: The radioactivity will gradually clear from your body over time.  The exact duration depends on the dose and your body's metabolism. Your healthcare provider can provide more specific information.
