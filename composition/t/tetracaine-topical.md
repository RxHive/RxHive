# Tetracaine (Topical)
### Generic Name
Tetracaine (Topical)

### Usage
Tetracaine topical is a local anesthetic primarily used to numb the skin before procedures like venipuncture (needle insertion into a vein) or venous cannulation (inserting a catheter into a vein).  This ensures patient comfort during these procedures. While primarily used for this purpose,  some formulations might be used for other localized pain relief, although this is not always FDA-approved for all ages.  Always check the specific product labeling for approved uses.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Local anesthesia (Topical):**
    * **Gel (4%):** For skin anesthesia before venipuncture or cannulation, apply up to approximately 1 gram (1 tube) per site. A maximum of 5 sites can be treated per 24-hour period, not exceeding a total of approximately 7 grams (7 tubes).
    * **Cream (1%) or Ointment (0.5%):** Apply to affected areas 3-4 times daily as needed.
    * **Solution (0.25% or 0.5%):**  For larynx, trachea, or esophagus, apply before the procedure as directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Rectal:**
    * **Cream (1%) or Ointment (0.5%):** Apply rectally up to 6 times daily.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Local anesthesia (Topical):**
    * **Gel (4%):** For infants 1 month and older, children, and adolescents, apply up to approximately 1 gram (1 tube) per venipuncture or cannulation site, not exceeding 2 grams (2 tubes) in 24 hours.
* **Note:**  Topical creams, ointments, and solutions (excluding the 4% gel) are generally *not* FDA-approved for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

* Common:  Application site reactions such as edema (swelling), erythema (redness), and pruritus (itching) are possible.
* Less Common, but Serious:  Severe application-site reactions, including blisters, are possible, though rare.  Methemoglobinemia (a blood disorder) is a potential, though rare, serious side effect.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe reactions,  consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Tetracaine is an ester-type local anesthetic. It works by blocking the transmission of pain signals along nerves. It achieves this by reducing the flow of sodium ions into nerve cells, preventing the nerve from firing and sending pain signals to the brain. This results in a localized loss of sensation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Do not use tetracaine if you are allergic to tetracaine, other ester-type anesthetics, or any component of the formulation. Do not apply to broken skin, mucous membranes (like the eyes or mouth), or ears. It should not be used in premature infants or full-term infants less than one month old.
* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of methemoglobinemia and tetracaine toxicity with the use of large amounts. Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders.
* **Interactions:** Tetracaine's effects may be altered by certain medications, including sulfonamides, aminosalicylic acid, anticholinesterases, and suxamethonium. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Tetracaine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The effect on breastfeeding is unknown, and breastfeeding is not recommended during its use.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for tetracaine to work?**  A: For skin anesthesia before venipuncture, application 30 minutes prior is generally recommended; for venous cannulation, approximately 45 minutes before is advised.
* **Q: Can I use tetracaine on open wounds?** A: No, tetracaine should only be applied to intact skin.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare professional immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
* **Q: How should I store tetracaine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
