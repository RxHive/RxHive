# Teclozan
### Generic Name
Teclozan

### Usage
Teclozan is a medication used to treat intestinal amebiasis, both acute and chronic.  Amebiasis is an infection caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*, a parasite that can affect the intestines.  Teclozan is specifically effective against this parasite in the intestines.  It is *not* typically used for extra-intestinal amebiasis (amebiasis affecting organs outside the intestines); in such cases, it may be used as part of a combination therapy following treatment with a systemic amebicide to prevent recurrence.

### Dosage

**Intestinal Amebiasis (Acute or Chronic):**

* **Adults:** The usual dose is 500 mg every 12 hours for a total of three doses (or 500 mg three times daily).
* **Children over 12 years:** The usual dose is 500 mg every 12 hours for a total of three doses (or 500 mg three times daily).
* **Children under 8 years:** Teclozan is contraindicated (not to be used) in children under the age of 8.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The provided information does not include specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these situations.  The information provided here is for general awareness and does not substitute for a doctor's prescription and instructions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, though the frequency is not specified, may include:

* Nausea
* Flatulence (gas)
* Vomiting

While rare, serious side effects are possible. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Teclozan works by interfering with the phospholipid metabolism of *Entamoeba histolytica*.  This disruption prevents the parasite from producing arachidonic acid, a vital component for its survival, leading to its death and elimination from the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Teclozan is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to Teclozan or any of its components, and in children under 8 years of age.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety and efficacy of Teclozan during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been established. The potential benefits of treatment should be carefully weighed against the potential risks to the mother and the fetus or infant.  A healthcare professional should be consulted before using Teclozan during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:**  Interactions with other medications are not explicitly detailed in the provided information.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking before starting treatment with Teclozan.
* **Extra-intestinal Amebiasis:** For extra-intestinal amebiasis, Teclozan should be used in conjunction with a systemic amebicide and only after the systemic treatment is completed, to prevent recurrence.
* **Hygiene:** Good hygiene practices are essential to prevent reinfection after treatment.
