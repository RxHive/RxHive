# Telbivudine
### Generic Name
Telbivudine

### Usage
Telbivudine is a medication used to treat chronic hepatitis B (HBV) in adults.  It's specifically indicated for patients showing signs of viral replication (meaning the virus is actively multiplying) and either persistently elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST) or evidence of active liver inflammation (histologically active disease).  Telbivudine works by interfering with the HBV's ability to replicate, thus helping to control the infection and potentially slow liver damage.  It's important to note that Telbivudine is not a cure for HBV; it's a long-term treatment aimed at managing the infection.


### Dosage

**Adults with Chronic Hepatitis B:** The standard oral dose is 600 mg once daily.  However,  if the virus is not suppressed adequately (HBV DNA levels remain above 300 copies/mL), alternative treatment should be considered.  Regular monitoring of HBV DNA levels (every 6 months) is crucial to assess treatment effectiveness.  If HBV DNA becomes positive at any point after initial response, a switch to alternative therapy is necessary. The optimal duration of treatment hasn't been definitively established.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of Telbivudine have not been established in children under 16 years old. For those aged 16 and older with chronic HBV, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally needed for patients with liver problems.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with kidney problems.  The adjustments depend on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate:
    * CrCl â‰¥ 50 mL/min: No adjustment needed.
    * CrCl 30-49 mL/min: 600 mg every 48 hours.
    * CrCl < 30 mL/min (not on dialysis): 600 mg every 72 hours.
    * End-stage renal disease (ESRD): 600 mg every 96 hours.
    * Hemodialysis: Administer the dose after the dialysis session.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels (an enzyme found in muscle)

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fever
* Insomnia
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Increased serum lipase levels (an enzyme in the pancreas)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Abdominal distension
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Increased serum ALT and AST levels (liver enzymes)
* Exacerbation of hepatitis B (worsening of the infection)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Cough
* Pharyngolaryngeal pain (sore throat)

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1%, post-marketing reports, and/or case reports):**

* Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
* Hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin levels)
* Hypoesthesia (reduced sensation)
* Increased amylase levels (pancreatic enzyme)
* Lactic acidosis (build-up of lactic acid)
* Liver steatosis (fatty liver)
* Myopathy (muscle disease)
* Myositis (muscle inflammation)
* Paresthesia (tingling or numbness)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Telbivudine is a nucleoside analog.  It works by mimicking a natural building block of DNA (thymidine).  When the hepatitis B virus tries to replicate its DNA, it incorporates Telbivudine into its new DNA strands. This interferes with the virus's ability to build complete and functional DNA, effectively stopping its replication and reducing the viral load in the body.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Allergy to Telbivudine or any of its components.
* Concurrent use with peginterferon alfa-2a.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Telbivudine can cause serious exacerbations of hepatitis B if stopped abruptly. Liver function must be carefully monitored for several months after stopping treatment.  Restarting treatment may be necessary.
* There's an increased risk of lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy.
* Use with caution in patients with renal impairment and liver transplant patients.
* Pregnancy Category B:  While studies in animals have not shown harm, the effects on human pregnancy are not fully known.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* Breastfeeding: Excretion in breast milk is unknown.  The potential benefits should be weighed against the risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Telbivudine with food?** A:  Telbivudine can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Telbivudine?** A: Store Telbivudine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Is Telbivudine a cure for hepatitis B?** A: No, Telbivudine is a long-term treatment to manage the virus and prevent liver damage.  It is not a cure.

* **Q:  Can Telbivudine be used to treat other viral infections?** A:  No, Telbivudine is primarily for treating chronic hepatitis B. It doesn't have significant activity against other viruses like HIV.

* **Q:  What if I develop resistance to Telbivudine?** A: Your doctor will need to change your treatment plan to a different antiviral medication.
