# Technetium Tc 99m Sodium Pertechnetate
### Generic Name
Technetium Tc 99m Sodium Pertechnetate

### Usage
Technetium Tc 99m sodium pertechnetate is a radioactive substance used primarily as a diagnostic imaging agent.  It's not a treatment for any condition. Instead, it helps doctors visualize various parts of the body to diagnose certain issues. Its main uses include:

* **Dacryoscintigraphy (Nasolacrimal Drainage System Imaging):**  This procedure assesses the function of the tear ducts, helping to diagnose problems like blocked tear ducts.  The medication is instilled into the eye, and its movement is tracked to identify blockages.

* **Salivary Gland Imaging:**  This helps evaluate the function and structure of the salivary glands, assisting in the diagnosis of conditions like salivary gland inflammation or tumors.

* **Thyroid Gland Imaging:** This helps visualize the thyroid gland, aiding in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, inflammation (thyroiditis), or other thyroid disorders.

* **Direct Isotopic Cystography (Urinary Bladder Imaging):** This technique is used to diagnose vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder to the ureters and possibly the kidneys. The medication is instilled into the bladder to visualize the urinary tract.


### Dosage

**Dosage is highly variable and depends on the specific imaging procedure and the patient's weight.  It's crucial to emphasize that the following information is for general understanding only.  A nuclear medicine physician will calculate the precise dosage for each patient based on their individual needs and the imaging equipment used.**  The dose is always measured with an appropriate radioactivity calibration system immediately before administration.

**Adults:**

* **Nasolacrimal drainage system imaging (dacryoscintigraphy):** Ophthalmic instillation – up to 0.1 mCi (3.7 MBq)
* **Salivary gland imaging:** Intravenous (IV) – 1-5 mCi (37-185 MBq)
* **Thyroid gland imaging:** IV – 1-10 mCi (37-370 MBq)
* **Urinary bladder vesicoureteral imaging:** Intravesicular (via urethral catheter) – 0.5 to 1 mCi (18.5-37 MBq)

**Children and Adolescents:**

* **Thyroid gland imaging:** IV – 60–80 µCi/kg (2.2–2.96 MBq/kg)
* **Urinary bladder imaging (direct isotopic cystography):** Intracatheter (urethral) – 0.5 to 1 mCi (18.5–37 MBq)

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided information does not include adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Consult the prescribing information for any specific details.


### Side Effects

* Allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis)


While rare, serious allergic reactions are possible. Immediate medical attention should be sought if any signs of an allergic reaction appear.


### How it Works

Technetium Tc 99m sodium pertechnetate behaves similarly to iodine in the body.  It's taken up by various tissues, including the thyroid, salivary glands, and the lining of the stomach.  When administered intravenously, it circulates in the bloodstream, allowing visualization of blood flow.  When used in dacryoscintigraphy, it follows the path of tears, and in cystography, it fills the bladder and ureters. The radioactive technetium emits gamma rays, which are detected by a special camera (gamma camera) to create images of the targeted area. This allows doctors to visualize the structure and function of the organ or system being examined.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Technetium Tc 99m sodium pertechnetate is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The use during pregnancy should be carefully evaluated, and elective procedures are usually postponed until after delivery.  Breastfeeding interruption for up to 24 hours after administration is recommended (depending on the dose).
* **Hypersensitivity:** Patients with a known hypersensitivity to technetium or other components of the medication should not receive it.
* **Radiation Exposure:**  This is a radioactive substance; proper handling and disposal are essential to minimize radiation exposure to healthcare personnel and the patient.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to complete the procedure?**  A: The imaging procedure duration varies depending on the area being imaged.

* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions before the procedure?** A:  Generally, no special diet is required before the procedure, unless otherwise specified by the physician.

* **Q: How long does the medication stay in my body?** A: The technetium is mostly excreted through the urine and feces within 24 hours.


* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Signs of an allergic reaction can range from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for children?** A:  It can be used in children, but the dosage is carefully adjusted based on their weight and the type of imaging needed.  Use in children is always under a physician's care.
