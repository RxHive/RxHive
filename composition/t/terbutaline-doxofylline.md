# Terbutaline + Doxofylline

**Generic Name:** Terbutaline and Doxofylline Combination (Note:  This is a combination drug; there isn't one single generic name for the combination itself.  Each component has its own generic name.)


**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's primarily used for bronchodilation â€“ widening the airways to improve breathing.  It is often prescribed for patients experiencing wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing associated with COPD.  The prescription should be tailored to the specific needs of the patient, and always followed carefully.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Terbutaline-related:**  Increased heart rate (tachycardia), palpitations, tremors, nervousness, headache, muscle cramps, dizziness.  Rare but serious side effects can include irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias) and low potassium levels (hypokalemia).
* **Doxofylline-related:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, headache, insomnia.  Rare but serious side effects can include liver problems and seizures.

It's crucial to note that this list isn't exhaustive.  Patients should immediately consult a doctor if they experience any unusual or concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Terbutaline:** This is a beta2-adrenergic agonist.  It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  This effect is relatively fast-acting.
* **Doxofylline:** This is a methylxanthine, a type of bronchodilator and phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It works by relaxing the airways and also reducing inflammation in the lungs.  Its effects are typically longer-lasting than terbutaline's.

The combination of terbutaline and doxofylline aims to provide both rapid relief (terbutaline) and longer-term bronchodilation and inflammation reduction (doxofylline).
