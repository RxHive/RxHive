# Tirofiban
### Generic Name
Tirofiban

### Usage

Tirofiban is primarily used to reduce the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).  These events include death, myocardial infarction (heart attack), or refractory ischemia (inadequate blood supply to the heart) requiring repeat cardiac procedures.  It's administered intravenously (IV).  While its primary use is in NSTE-ACS,  Tirofiban is sometimes used off-label in other situations, such as:

*   **Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI):**  Used during PCI to help prevent blood clots from forming at the site of the procedure.
*   **High-risk patients with stable ischemic heart disease undergoing elective PCI:** In specific cases, it may be used in conjunction with other antiplatelet agents to further reduce the risk of complications.
*   **Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI:** Again, this is off-label use, often in combination with other medications, and requires careful consideration by the physician.

It's crucial to understand that off-label uses should only be considered under the strict supervision and guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.  The risks and benefits must be carefully weighed for each individual patient.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the patient's condition, weight, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions. Tirofiban is administered intravenously.  The typical regimen involves:

* **Unstable angina/NSTEMI:**
    * Loading dose: 25 mcg/kg given over 5 minutes or less.
    * Maintenance infusion: 0.15 mcg/kg/min for up to 18 hours.
* **PCI:**
    * Loading dose: 25 mcg/kg given over 5 minutes or less at the time of the procedure.
    * Maintenance infusion: 0.15 mcg/kg/min for up to 18 hours.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:**  If the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is â‰¤ 60 mL/min, the loading dose remains the same, but the maintenance infusion is reduced to 0.075 mcg/kg/min.  Tirofiban is dialyzable.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Tirofiban in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Minor bleeding
Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Major hemorrhage (including intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding, genitourinary bleeding, pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage, and spinal-epidural hematoma)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea

Other less frequent side effects reported include: coronary artery dissection, bradycardia, edema, vasodepressor syncope, diaphoresis, pelvic pain, leg pain, fever, anaphylaxis, hemopericardium, hypersensitivity, skin rash, and urticaria.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Tirofiban works by blocking the action of fibrinogen, a protein crucial for blood clot formation.  It achieves this by binding to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets.  By inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen, Tirofiban prevents platelets from clumping together and forming clots, thereby reducing the risk of thrombotic events in patients with coronary artery disease.  The effect is reversible after the infusion is stopped.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tirofiban is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to the drug, active internal bleeding, significant bleeding disorders, recent major surgery or trauma,  uncontrolled hypertension, certain types of heart conditions, or those at high risk of bleeding.  It should not be used concurrently with other GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
* **Interactions:**  Concomitant use with other drugs that affect hemostasis (such as anticoagulants, thrombolytics, other platelet aggregation inhibitors) increases the risk of bleeding.  Careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Tirofiban is a Category B drug in pregnancy. Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued or the drug should not be used during breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients have a higher risk of bleeding when Tirofiban is used with heparin. Close monitoring is crucial in this population.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment.  No adjustments are usually required for hepatic impairment.

**Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.**


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Tirofiban?**  A: Tirofiban is administered as a short-term intravenous infusion, typically lasting for a specific duration determined by your doctor (e.g., 18-24 hours depending on the condition and treatment strategy).  It is not a long-term medication.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Tirofiban?** A: Dizziness and headache are possible side effects. If you experience these symptoms, avoid driving or operating machinery.

* **Q: How should I store Tirofiban?** A: Tirofiban is administered intravenously in a hospital setting and does not require storage by the patient.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Tirofiban is given as a continuous intravenous infusion; therefore, there are no individual "doses" to miss. The infusion duration is pre-determined by the physician.  If you have concerns, contact your healthcare provider.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of using Tirofiban?**  A:  Tirofiban is used for a short duration; long-term effects are not typically a concern. However, it's essential to follow up with your doctor for monitoring and assessment after treatment.
