# Tirofiban

**Generic Name:** Tirofiban

**Usage:** Tirofiban is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures, such as angioplasty or stenting.  It's also used to prevent serious cardiac events in patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).  It's typically administered intravenously.  It's important to note that Tirofiban is a prescription medication and should only be used under the supervision of a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Tirofiban can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk and can range from minor bruising to life-threatening hemorrhage.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:**  Another common side effect.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can be serious.
* **Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count):** A decrease in blood platelets which can increase bleeding risk.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions can occur, ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis.
* **Bruising:**  Frequently observed.


This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  It's crucial to report any unusual symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Tirofiban works by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on platelets. These receptors are crucial for platelet aggregation (clumping together). By blocking these receptors, Tirofiban prevents platelets from sticking together and forming clots, thus reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular events.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long is Tirofiban administered?** A: The duration of Tirofiban treatment depends on the patient's condition and the specific procedure. It's typically administered intravenously for a specific period during and after PCI or for a set duration in the case of unstable angina or NSTEMI.  The physician will determine the appropriate duration.

* **Q: Who should not take Tirofiban?** A: Patients with a history of significant bleeding, active bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia, or uncontrolled hypertension should generally not take Tirofiban.  Pregnancy, breastfeeding, and certain other medical conditions also require careful consideration.  A physician will assess individual risk factors.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience bleeding while taking Tirofiban?** A:  Bleeding is a serious side effect.  Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or excessive bleeding while on Tirofiban.
