# Ticlopidine + Aspirin

**Generic Name:** Ticlopidine + Aspirin (This combination is not a standard, pre-made formulation.  Ticlopidine and aspirin are often used together, but not typically in a single combined pill.)

**Usage:**  Ticlopidine and aspirin are individually used, and sometimes prescribed together, to prevent blood clots (thrombosis).  This combination might be used in patients at high risk of stroke or heart attack, particularly those who have had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and cannot tolerate clopidogrel.  *It is crucial to understand that this is not a standard combination and the doctor will prescribe each drug individually.*  The doctor will carefully weigh the benefits and risks for each patient. Aspirin is used more broadly for preventing clotting.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects listed below are for *each drug individually* and may not all occur when used together. The combination can also increase the risk of side effects.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you are experiencing side effects.

* **Ticlopidine:**  Serious side effects include neutropenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP â€“ a serious blood clotting disorder).  Less serious side effects can include diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, and headache.  *Ticlopidine carries a significant risk of serious blood disorders and is generally only used when other antiplatelet drugs are not tolerated.*

* **Aspirin:** Common side effects include stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, and bleeding (nosebleeds, easy bruising, or unusual bleeding).  Serious but less common side effects include stomach ulcers and allergic reactions.

**How it Works:**

* **Ticlopidine:** This drug inhibits platelet aggregation (the clumping together of platelets, which is a crucial step in blood clot formation). It does this by blocking the ADP receptor on platelets.

* **Aspirin:** This drug inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are involved in the production of thromboxane A2, a substance that promotes platelet aggregation.  By inhibiting COX, aspirin reduces platelet aggregation and therefore reduces the risk of blood clot formation.  Low-dose aspirin is usually used for this effect.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination always prescribed together?** No.  Ticlopidine and aspirin are often prescribed separately.  Using them together requires careful monitoring due to increased risk of bleeding.  The decision to use this combination is made on a case-by-case basis by a physician.

* **What are the alternatives?** Clopidogrel is a more commonly used antiplatelet drug than ticlopidine, often preferred due to its lower risk of serious side effects.

* **How is this combination monitored?** Blood counts (to monitor for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) are essential when ticlopidine is used. Regular monitoring of potential bleeding complications is also necessary when both drugs are administered.

* **Who should not take this combination?** Patients with known allergies to either ticlopidine or aspirin, those with a history of significant bleeding problems, or those with low blood cell counts should not take this combination.
