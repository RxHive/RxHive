# Ticlopidine + Aspirin
### Generic Name
Ticlopidine + Aspirin (Combination Therapy)


Note:  Ticlopidine and aspirin are often used *together*, but it's crucial to understand that this is a *combination therapy* prescribed by a doctor, not a single generic medicine with a fixed ratio.  The specific dosage of each component will be determined individually by your healthcare provider.  This information outlines the properties of each drug within the context of this combination.  It's vital to follow your doctor's instructions precisely.


### Usage

This combination therapy is primarily used to prevent blood clots (thrombosis) in patients at high risk.  This is especially relevant for individuals who have experienced a stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA, or "mini-stroke"), or have certain heart conditions that increase their risk of clot formation.  Aspirin is a well-known antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation (clumping), while ticlopidine, though less commonly used now due to side effect concerns, also works to reduce platelet aggregation, offering an additional layer of protection against clot formation in specific high-risk patients.  The combination may be considered when aspirin alone is insufficient to provide adequate protection.  Always consult a physician before initiating or altering this combination therapy.


### Dosage

**There is no standardized, fixed dosage for the combination of ticlopidine and aspirin.**  The dosage of each component (ticlopidine and aspirin) is individually determined and prescribed by a physician, based on the patient's specific medical history, risk factors, and overall health.  Dosage will vary greatly depending on these factors.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescribed dosages carefully.  Self-adjusting dosages can be dangerous.


Typical individual dosages of each drug (when used in combination) might include:

* **Aspirin:**  Ranges from 75mg to 325mg daily.

* **Ticlopidine:**  Ranges from 250mg twice daily to a total daily dose potentially exceeding 500mg.  (However, itâ€™s important to note that higher doses can significantly increase the risk of side effects).

**Oral Administration:** Both ticlopidine and aspirin are typically administered orally.  Your doctor will specify the dosage form (tablet, coated tablet, etc.) and frequency.

**IV Administration:** Neither ticlopidine nor aspirin is typically administered intravenously for this specific indication.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (May Occur in >10% of Patients):**

* **Aspirin:**  Gastrointestinal upset (heartburn, nausea, stomach pain), bleeding (minor bleeding or bruising).

* **Ticlopidine:**  Diarrhea, rash, nausea.

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (May Occur in <10% of Patients):**

* **Aspirin:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers.

* **Ticlopidine:**  Neutropenia (a decrease in white blood cells), thrombocytopenia (a decrease in platelets, leading to increased bleeding risk), agranulocytosis (a severe deficiency of white blood cells),  hepatitis (liver inflammation).


**If you experience any unusual bleeding, signs of an allergic reaction (such as rash, itching, swelling), or severe gastrointestinal problems, stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention.**

### How it Works

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing the production of thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator.  This prevents platelets from sticking together and forming clots.  Ticlopidine, though its mechanism is more complex, also inhibits platelet aggregation, possibly by interfering with platelet receptor interactions. The combination provides a potentially more potent antiplatelet effect than aspirin alone.


### Precautions

* **Bleeding Risk:** This combination significantly increases the risk of bleeding. Patients with bleeding disorders or those on other medications that increase bleeding risk (e.g., anticoagulants) should use this combination with extreme caution under strict medical supervision.

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with known allergies to aspirin or ticlopidine should avoid this combination.

* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Both ticlopidine and aspirin can affect liver and kidney function. Regular monitoring may be necessary, especially in patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disease.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a healthcare provider, as the benefits must outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination can interact with various other medications, including anticoagulants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain herbal supplements.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.

* **Age:**  The use of this combination should be carefully considered in older adults and children due to increased risk of side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication without consulting my doctor?**  A: No, abruptly stopping this medication can be dangerous.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?**  A: Store both medications as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double the dose to catch up.


* **Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol while on this medication?** A: It's generally advisable to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this combination due to the increased risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal problems.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q:  Is Ticlopidine still commonly prescribed?** A: Ticlopidine use has decreased due to the risk of serious side effects, particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  Clopidogrel is now frequently preferred as a safer alternative.  The use of Ticlopidine in combination with Aspirin will depend largely on the physician's assessment of the patient and benefits/risk balance.
