# Tenofovir Alafenamide
### Generic Name
Tenofovir Alafenamide

### Usage
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a medication primarily used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.  Its main role is to suppress the replication of these viruses, helping to improve liver health in CHB and to manage HIV, improving the quality of life and preventing disease progression. While primarily used for these two conditions, research continues to explore its potential applications in other viral infections.

### Dosage

**Chronic Hepatitis B:**

* **Adults:** The typical dose is 25 mg once daily (OD) orally, taken with food.

**HIV Infection:** TAF is not used as a monotherapy for HIV.  Dosage for HIV treatment varies depending on the specific combination regimen prescribed by a healthcare provider. The regimen will typically include other antiretroviral agents.  Always refer to the prescribing information for the specific HIV combination drug containing TAF.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For adults with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no dosage adjustment is typically necessary.  However, use is generally not recommended for individuals with decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B or C).
* **Renal Impairment:**  For adults with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of â‰¥15 mL/min, no dosage adjustment is usually required.  However, TAF is generally not recommended for those with CrCl <15 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not undergoing hemodialysis.  For individuals on hemodialysis, the dose remains the same, administered after dialysis on hemodialysis days.

**Forms:**  Tenofovir alafenamide is available in oral tablet form.

**Administration:**  Always take TAF as directed by your healthcare provider. It's generally recommended to take it with food.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Decreased bone mineral density
* Increased serum creatine kinase levels (muscle enzyme)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Lactic acidosis (build-up of lactic acid in the blood)
* Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
* Severe acute exacerbation of hepatitis B (following treatment discontinuation)
* Renal toxicity (kidney damage)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, urticaria)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Tenofovir alafenamide is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, tenofovir, inside the body's cells.  The active tenofovir then works by interfering with the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial for the replication of HIV and HBV.  By inhibiting this enzyme, tenofovir prevents the viruses from making copies of themselves, thus suppressing viral replication and slowing disease progression.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** TAF is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to tenofovir alafenamide or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Co-administration with certain drugs that affect kidney function or compete for the same kidney transport systems may increase tenofovir levels, raising the risk of adverse effects.  Co-administration with drugs like rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and oxcarbazepine is generally not recommended as they may decrease TAF levels. Consult with your healthcare provider about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.
* **Renal & Hepatic Impairment:**  Caution is warranted in individuals with kidney or liver problems. Dosage adjustments or avoidance of TAF might be necessary depending on the severity of impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** TAF has low placental transfer, and its use during pregnancy can be considered in certain cases, especially for pregnant people with HIV.  The amount of TAF excreted in breast milk is unknown, but breastfeeding is not contraindicated for hepatitis B unless nipples are cracked or bleeding.  Always discuss this with your physician.
* **Post-treatment Exacerbation:**  Stopping treatment with TAF, particularly for Hepatitis B, can lead to a severe worsening of the infection. Close monitoring of liver function is crucial after stopping TAF.
* **Bone Mineral Density:** TAF can decrease bone mineral density, particularly with prolonged use.  Regular monitoring and consideration of preventive measures may be necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take TAF with other medications?** A: It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting TAF. Certain drug interactions can occur.
* **Q: How should I store TAF?** A: Store TAF as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: Is TAF safe for children?** A:  The use of TAF in children varies depending on the condition being treated and their age and weight.  Dosage and safety are determined by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How long will I need to take TAF?** A: The duration of treatment with TAF depends on the condition being treated and your response to therapy.  Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
* **Q: Can I stop taking TAF if I feel better?** A:  Do not stop taking TAF without consulting your healthcare provider.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to serious complications, especially with Hepatitis B.
