# Tamsulosin + Tadalafil
### Generic Name
Tamsulosin + Tadalafil (Combination Therapy)


**Note:**  Tamsulosin and Tadalafil are not typically combined into a single pill.  This information describes the use of these two medications *together*, prescribed separately by a doctor for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and erectile dysfunction (ED).  It is crucial to only take these medications as prescribed by your physician.


### Usage

This combination therapy is used to treat both benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in men.  

* **Tamsulosin:** This alpha-blocker relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing symptoms of BPH such as frequent urination, weak urine stream, and nighttime urination.

* **Tadalafil:** This phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor increases blood flow to the penis, aiding in achieving and maintaining an erection.  It's used to treat ED.


By combining these medications, a physician may address both the urinary symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate and erectile dysfunction simultaneously in men who experience both conditions.


### Dosage

**Dosage must be determined by your doctor.** There is no standardized combination dosage of Tamsulosin and Tadalafil as they are typically prescribed as separate medications. Your physician will determine the appropriate dosage of each drug based on your individual health status, medical history, and response to treatment.


* **Tamsulosin:**  Dosage typically ranges from 0.4mg to 0.8mg once daily, orally.  Dosage adjustments might be made based on individual response and tolerance.

* **Tadalafil:**  For ED, the usual starting dose is 10mg, taken as needed, at least 30 minutes before sexual activity.  The dose can be increased to 20mg or decreased to 5mg based on efficacy and side effects.  It is not intended for daily use unless specifically prescribed by a doctor for daily treatment of ED.  

**Children:** Neither Tamsulosin nor Tadalafil are typically used in children.

**IV Administration:** Neither Tamsulosin nor Tadalafil are typically administered intravenously.

### How it Works

* **Tamsulosin:**  Relaxes smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck by blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. This relaxation reduces the pressure on the urethra, improving urine flow.

* **Tadalafil:** Inhibits PDE5, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic GMP.  Increased cyclic GMP levels relax smooth muscles in the penis, increasing blood flow and facilitating an erection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tamsulosin should not be used in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to the medication or other similar drugs. Tadalafil is contraindicated in patients with certain heart conditions, low blood pressure, or severe liver or kidney disease.  Consult your doctor to ensure this combination is safe for you.

* **Drug Interactions:** Both Tamsulosin and Tadalafil can interact with other medications.  It is essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.

* **Pregnant/Breastfeeding Women:**  These medications are not intended for use in women.

* **Elderly:**  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.

* **Other Precautions:**  Alcohol consumption can worsen some side effects.  Avoid activities requiring alertness if experiencing dizziness or drowsiness.
