# Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid
### Generic Name
Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid

### Usage

Technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily as an imaging agent.  Its main applications include:

* **Lymph Node Localization:**  It's used to identify lymph nodes draining a primary tumor, particularly in patients with breast cancer or malignant melanoma. A handheld gamma counter is used in conjunction with the injection to pinpoint these nodes.

* **Reticuloendothelial System (RES) Imaging:** This agent helps visualize the RES, which includes organs like the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. This imaging is valuable in assessing the function of these organs.

* **Peritoneo-venous (LeVeen) Shunt Patency Evaluation:** Technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid can be used to check if a LeVeen shunt (a type of shunt used to drain fluid from the abdomen) is working correctly.

* **Esophageal Transit Studies and Gastroesophageal Reflux Scintigraphy:**  The agent aids in studying how food moves through the esophagus and detecting gastroesophageal reflux.

* **Detection of Pulmonary Aspiration:**  It can help determine if gastric contents have been aspirated (inhaled) into the lungs.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific application and the patient's age and weight.  The following dosages are guidelines only, and a healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose in each case:


**Adults:**

* **Breast cancer/Malignant melanoma lymph node localization (Subcutaneous):** 0.1-1 mCi (3.7-37 MBq) in 0.1-1 mL volume.
* **Peritoneo-venous shunt patency (Intraperitoneal):** 1-3 mCi (37-111 MBq).  Percutaneous transtubal injection (efferent limb): 0.3-1 mCi (12-37 MBq) in a maximum volume of 0.5 mL.
* **Reticuloendothelial cell imaging (Intravenous):** Bone marrow: 3-12 mCi (111-444 MBq); Liver/spleen: 1-8 mCi (37-296 MBq).
* **Esophageal transit/GERD/pulmonary aspiration (Oral):** Gastroesophageal studies: 0.15-0.3 mCi (5.55-11.1 MBq); Pulmonary aspiration studies: 0.3-0.5 mCi (11.1-18.5 MBq).

**Children:**

* **Reticuloendothelial cell imaging (Intravenous):** Bone marrow: 0.03-0.15 mCi/kg (1.11-5.55 MBq/kg); Liver/spleen: Newborns: 0.2-0.5 mCi (7.4-18.5 MBq); Children & adolescents: 0.015-0.075 mCi/kg (0.56-2.78 MBq/kg).
* **Esophageal transit/GERD/pulmonary aspiration (Oral or Nasogastric):** 0.1-0.3 mCi (3.7-11.1 MBq).


**Dosage Adjustments:** The provided information doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are not consistently defined in available information but may include:

* Injection site reactions (burning, erythema, swelling, scarring, sclerosis, necrosis)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Chills
* Dizziness
* Fever
* Hypotension
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
*  Diaphoresis (sweating)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include anaphylactic shock, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, dyspnea (shortness of breath), seizures, and cardiorespiratory arrest.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.

### How it Works

Technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid contains technetium-99m, a radioactive isotope that emits gamma rays.  These gamma rays are detectable by specialized imaging equipment.  The sulfur colloid component allows the technetium to be taken up by specific cells and tissues, depending on the route of administration.  For example:

* **Subcutaneous injection:** The colloid enters the lymphatic system, allowing visualization of lymph nodes.
* **Intravenous injection:** Uptake occurs in the RES, allowing imaging of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.
* **Oral or nasogastric administration:** It remains largely unabsorbed, making it useful for studying esophageal transit and detecting aspiration.


The emitted gamma rays provide the images used for diagnosis.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with a history of allergies should inform their healthcare provider before receiving this medication as there is a potential risk of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  It crosses the placenta, and the decision to use it during pregnancy should be carefully considered, weighing the benefits against the potential risks to the fetus.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding may need to be temporarily interrupted.
* **Radiation Exposure:** This is a radioactive substance. Radiation exposure should be minimized, and appropriate safety measures should be followed during handling and administration.
* **Other Medications:** No specific drug interactions are explicitly listed, but it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pre-existing conditions:**  Patients with compromised liver or spleen function should be carefully monitored.

### FAQs

* **How is Technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid stored?** It should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically in a shielded container to minimize radiation exposure.

* **Is this a long-term treatment?** No, it's used for diagnostic imaging purposes. It's a single dose medication, administered as needed for imaging procedures.

* **Are there any long-term effects?** The long-term effects are primarily related to radiation exposure, which are generally low for diagnostic doses.  However, it is important to follow all safety guidelines.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  This medication is administered as a single dose for a specific imaging procedure. It's not applicable to miss doses.  If you are unsure about your imaging appointment, contact your doctor's office.

* **Can I drive after receiving this medication?** Usually yes, but it's important to listen to your doctor's advice and to be aware of any potential side effects that might affect your ability to drive.
