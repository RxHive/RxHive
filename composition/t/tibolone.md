# Tibolone
### Generic Name
Tibolone

### Usage

Tibolone is a synthetic steroid primarily used for the short-term management of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats) in postmenopausal women, specifically those at least one year post-menopause.  It's crucial to note that this is a short-term treatment option.  A secondary, important use is in the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures who cannot tolerate other osteoporosis medications.  Tibolone is *not* a contraceptive.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical dose for both vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis prevention is 2.5 mg orally once daily. Treatment should begin at least one year after natural menopause or immediately following surgical menopause or treatment with GnRH analogs.  If switching from other hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the timing depends on the previous regimen.  For sequential HRT, start Tibolone the day after the last dose.  For continuous-combined HRT, initiation can be at any time.  Adding a separate progestin to Tibolone is unnecessary and not recommended.  If a dose is missed by more than 12 hours, skip the missed dose and resume the regular schedule.

**Children:** Tibolone is not approved for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Tibolone is contraindicated in patients with liver dysfunction or disease. No specific dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, as the pharmacokinetics of Tibolone and its metabolites are not significantly affected by kidney function.

### How it Works

Tibolone itself is not active.  The body converts it into three active metabolites that possess estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic properties.  These metabolites act as a substitute for estrogen in postmenopausal women, alleviating the vasomotor symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency.  The reduction in bone turnover contributes to the prevention of osteoporosis.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Tibolone is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to Tibolone or its components
* Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
* Untreated endometrial hyperplasia
* Pregnancy or breastfeeding
* Active or history of arterial thromboembolic disease (e.g., angina, stroke, myocardial infarction)
* Active or past history of venous thromboembolism (e.g., DVT, PE) or thrombophlebitis
* Known thrombophilic disorders
* Partial or complete vision loss due to ophthalmic vascular diseases
* Porphyria
* Liver dysfunction or disease
* Known or suspected estrogen- or progestin-dependent malignancy (e.g., endometrial cancer)
* Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer


**Warnings and Cautions:**  Use with caution in patients with: asthma, diabetes, hypertension, conditions exacerbated by fluid retention, epilepsy, gallstones, hepatic disorders, migraines, otosclerosis, SLE, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, those on anticoagulants, those with thromboembolic risk factors, pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, history of endometrial hyperplasia, increased risk of estrogen-dependent tumors, history of recurrent miscarriage, obesity, and those over 60 years old (increased risk of coronary artery disease and dementia).  Increased risks of dementia, endometrial cancer/hyperplasia, ischemic stroke, lipid abnormalities, ovarian cancer, thromboembolic events, breast cancer, and coronary artery disease are associated with HRT use.


**Drug Interactions:** Enzyme inducers (barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin) may accelerate Tibolone metabolism.  Tibolone may increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin.  Concomitant use should be avoided in both cases.
