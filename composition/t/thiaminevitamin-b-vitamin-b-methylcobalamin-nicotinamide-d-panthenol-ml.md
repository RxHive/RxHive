# ThiamineVitamin B + Vitamin B + Methylcobalamin + Nicotinamide + D-Panthenol ml

It's impossible to provide detailed information about a generic "ThiamineVitamin B + Vitamin B + Methylcobalamin + Nicotinamide + D-Panthenol ml" without knowing which specific B vitamins are included (there are multiple B vitamins).
