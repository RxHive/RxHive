# Tenofovir Disoproxil
### Generic Name
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate

### Usage
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a medication primarily used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children older than 2 years.  It's also indicated for treating chronic Hepatitis B in adults and children older than 12 years.  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used off-label for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of HIV-1 in both occupational and non-occupational settings.  PEP aims to prevent HIV infection after potential exposure to the virus.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Chronic Hepatitis B:** The usual dose is 300 mg orally once daily.  Concurrent use with adefovir or other tenofovir combination products should be avoided.
* **HIV Infection:** The usual dose is 300 mg orally once daily, always in combination with other antiretroviral agents.
* **HIV-1 Non-occupational PEP (Off-label):** 300 mg orally once daily for 28 days, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  Treatment should begin within 72 hours of exposure.
* **HIV-1 Occupational PEP (Off-label):** 300 mg orally once daily, usually combined with emtricitabine and raltegravir, for 4 weeks. Treatment should start as soon as possible after exposure (within 72 hours).

**Children:**

Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age, weight, and the specific condition being treated (HIV or Hepatitis B).  It's crucial to follow the precise instructions provided by a healthcare professional, as weight-based dosing or specific formulations (like oral powder or tablets) may be necessary.  Consult the prescribing information for detailed pediatric dosing guidelines. Generally, for both HIV and Hepatitis B, the dose is 8 mg/kg once daily, not exceeding 300 mg/day.  Different dosage forms (powders, tablets) have specific instructions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with renal impairment.  For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) above 50 mL/min, no adjustment is needed.  Lower CrCl values require dose reductions and longer intervals between doses, or adjustments based on dialysis schedule.  Always consult a doctor before modifying the dosage. Hepatic impairment usually does not require dosage adjustment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** These are experienced by more than 10% of patients:

* Nervous System: Insomnia, headache, pain, dizziness, depression
* Dermatologic: Skin rash, itching
* Endocrine & Metabolic: High cholesterol, high triglycerides
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting
* Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Decreased bone mineral density, muscle weakness

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but can be serious and require immediate medical attention:

* Renal problems (including renal failure, Fanconi syndrome)
* Liver problems (including severe hepatitis, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly with steatosis)
* Pancreatitis
* Severe allergic reactions (angioedema, dyspnea)
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
* Osteomalacia

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a prodrug;  it needs to be converted into its active form, tenofovir, within the body. Tenofovir then inhibits the activity of HIV-1 and Hepatitis B reverse transcriptase enzymes.  These enzymes are crucial for viral replication. By blocking the action of reverse transcriptase, tenofovir prevents the virus from making copies of itself, effectively slowing the progression of the infection.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Tenofovir should not be used by individuals with known allergies to tenofovir or any components of the formulation.
* **Renal Impairment:** Tenofovir can affect kidney function, posing a greater risk to people with pre-existing kidney disease.  Careful monitoring of kidney function is vital.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** While generally not requiring dosage adjustment, liver function should still be monitored, especially in individuals with pre-existing liver conditions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tenofovir is classified as Pregnancy Category B. While generally safe, the benefits of treatment must be weighed against potential risks.  Women with HIV infection should not breastfeed to avoid transmitting the virus to the infant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tenofovir can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or causing increased side effects.  It's important to inform your doctor of all medications you're currently taking.
* **Post-treatment exacerbation of Hepatitis B:** A serious worsening of Hepatitis B can occur after stopping Tenofovir. Close monitoring of liver function is essential after stopping treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Tenofovir with food?**  A: Tablets can be taken with or without food. The oral powder should be mixed with soft food and swallowed immediately.
* **Q: How should I store Tenofovir?** A: Store Tenofovir as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses. Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Is Tenofovir a cure for HIV or Hepatitis B?** A: No, Tenofovir is not a cure, but it significantly suppresses viral replication, improving the patient's quality of life and long-term prognosis.  It must be taken as prescribed for effectiveness.
