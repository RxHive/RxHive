# Trisodium Citrate Dihydrate
### Generic Name
Trisodium Citrate Dihydrate

### Usage
Trisodium citrate dihydrate is primarily used as an anticoagulant in extracorporeal procedures, most notably granulocytapheresis.  Granulocytapheresis is a medical procedure where granulocytes (a type of white blood cell) are removed from the blood.  Trisodium citrate dihydrate prevents blood clotting during this process by binding to calcium ions, which are essential for blood coagulation.  It's also used off-label as a regional anticoagulant in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) circuits.  In this context, it helps prevent clotting within the CRRT machine during kidney dialysis.

### Dosage
**Granulocytapheresis:**  For extracorporeal granulocytapheresis, 30 mL of Trisodium citrate dihydrate is aseptically added to 500 mL of a 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solution immediately before the procedure.  The apheresis machine controls the administration of this mixture.

**Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) (Off-label Use):**  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on patient factors and monitoring parameters.  A 4% Trisodium citrate dihydrate solution is typically used. The initial infusion rate is usually approximately 1 to 1.5 times the blood flow rate through the CRRT circuit.  For example, if the blood flow rate is 100-200 mL/min, the initial infusion might start at 100-300 mL/h.  Frequent monitoring of ionized calcium (iCa) levels in either the CRRT circuit or the patient's blood is crucial to adjust the infusion rate.  The goal is to maintain iCa within a safe therapeutic range.  Specific target ranges will be determined by the healthcare provider based on individual patient needs.  This is **not** administered directly to the patient.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Trisodium citrate dihydrate in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Chills
*   Paresthesia (numbness or tingling) in lips and extremities
*   Cardiac arrhythmias
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Chest pressure
*   Stomach cramps

Less common, but serious side effects are possible.  Any unusual symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Trisodium citrate dihydrate acts as an anticoagulant by chelating (binding to) free ionized calcium ions in the blood.  Calcium is a vital component of the blood clotting cascade.  By binding to calcium, Trisodium citrate dihydrate makes it unavailable for the coagulation process, thereby preventing blood clots from forming during extracorporeal procedures.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Trisodium citrate dihydrate should not be administered directly via intravenous infusion. It is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure (transaminases >1000 units/L) and those with cardiogenic shock and blood lactate levels >8 mmol/L.
*   **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution in patients with hepatic (liver) impairment, as the liver metabolizes citrate.  Also use caution in patients with shock and impaired tissue perfusion.
*   **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently documented.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of Trisodium citrate dihydrate during pregnancy and lactation have not been established.
*   **Monitoring:**  Careful monitoring of serum electrolytes (calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, bicarbonate), acid-base balance, anion gap, and ionized calcium levels is essential, especially during CRRT. Regular monitoring of total body calcium and the calcium-to-ionized calcium ratio may also be necessary.

### FAQs
