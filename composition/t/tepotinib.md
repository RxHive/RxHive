# Tepotinib
### Generic Name
Tepotinib

### Usage
Tepotinib is a targeted cancer therapy, specifically a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  Its primary use is in treating adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  This treatment is only appropriate for patients whose tumors have a specific genetic alteration: a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping mutation.  This mutation makes the cancer cells particularly vulnerable to Tepotinib's action.  There are currently no other approved uses for Tepotinib.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage of Tepotinib is 450 mg once daily (OD) orally. This dosage continues until the cancer progresses or until intolerable side effects develop.  The medication should be taken with food at roughly the same time each day. Tablets should be swallowed whole; do not crush, chew, or split them.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of Tepotinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on liver and kidney function.  For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B), no dose adjustment is needed.  However, for those with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the manufacturerâ€™s labeling does not provide dosage guidance as this hasn't been established in clinical trials.  Similar guidance applies for renal impairment; if the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is 30 mL/minute or greater, no adjustment is necessary, but no specific guidance is provided for CrCl less than 30 mL/minute. Dosage reductions are also recommended for specific side effects; see the Side Effects section for details.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Tepotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by selectively targeting the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor, especially the mutated form caused by exon 14 skipping.  By inhibiting MET activity, Tepotinib blocks the signals that drive the growth and spread of cancer cells with this specific mutation.  This ultimately slows or stops tumor growth and prevents the cancer from metastasizing (spreading to other parts of the body).


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Tepotinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Tepotinib or any of its components.

* **Increased Risk:** Patients taking Tepotinib have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage), interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (lung inflammation), and complications related to the underlying MET alteration.  Regular monitoring of liver function and lung health is crucial.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tepotinib may harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after the final dose.  Tepotinib is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for one week after the last dose.

* **Drug Interactions:**  While not explicitly listed in this document, interactions with other drugs are possible. It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Tepotinib?** A:  Store Tepotinib tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  Consult the medication label for specific storage instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose. Consult your physician if you are unsure.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Tepotinib?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption while taking Tepotinib, as alcohol can have potential interactions with the medication and exacerbate side effects. Consult your physician about appropriate alcohol consumption while on this medication.

* **Q:  How long will I need to take Tepotinib?** A: The duration of treatment will depend on your individual response to the medication and the progression of your cancer. Your doctor will monitor your progress and determine the appropriate treatment length.

* **Q: Are there any specific tests required before or during treatment with Tepotinib?** A: Yes, testing to confirm the presence of MET exon 14 skipping alterations in your tumor is crucial before starting Tepotinib. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and lung function are also necessary throughout the treatment period.
