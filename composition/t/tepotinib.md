# Tepotinib

**Generic Name:** Tepotinib

**Usage:** Tepotinib is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has a specific genetic mutation called *EGFR exon 20 insertion*.  It's typically used after other treatments have failed.  It may also be used in combination with other therapies in certain situations, as determined by a physician.  This is not a first-line treatment; it's indicated for use in advanced or metastatic disease.


**Side Effects:**  Like all cancer therapies, tepotinib can cause side effects.  These can range in severity from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or redness.
* **Pneumonitis:** Inflammation of the lungs (a serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention).
* **Increased Liver Enzymes:**  This indicates potential liver damage and requires monitoring.
* **Vision changes:** Blurred vision or other visual disturbances.
* **Nail changes:** Discoloration or thickening of nails.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary from person to person.  Serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  It is crucial to report any concerning symptoms to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


**How it Works:** Tepotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by specifically targeting the abnormal EGFR protein caused by the exon 20 insertion mutation in NSCLC cells.  This mutation causes the EGFR protein to be constantly active, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of cancer. Tepotinib binds to and inhibits the activity of this mutated EGFR protein, slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.
