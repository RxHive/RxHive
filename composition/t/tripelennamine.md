# Tripelennamine
### Generic Name
Tripelennamine

### Usage
Tripelennamine is a first-generation antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever), urticaria (hives), and other allergic skin reactions. It's also sometimes used to treat the common cold and coughs, although its effectiveness in these conditions is less established compared to its antihistamine properties.  The topical cream form is specifically used for localized itching (pruritus).


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Oral (as hydrochloride):**  The typical dose for hypersensitivity reactions is 25-50 mg every 4-6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 600 mg.  Dosage should be adjusted based on individual needs and response.

* **Topical (2% cream):**  For pruritus, apply a thin layer of the cream to the affected area 2-4 times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Oral (as hydrochloride):** For hypersensitivity reactions in children, the usual dose is 5 mg per kilogram of body weight daily, divided into 4-6 doses. The maximum daily dose is 300 mg.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by a doctor or pharmacist based on the child's weight and age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial in such cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth, nose, and throat
* Dizziness
* Headache

If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Tripelennamine works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical substance in the body that triggers allergic reactions. It achieves this by binding to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing symptoms like itching, sneezing, and swelling. It also has some anticholinergic effects, which contribute to its ability to dry up secretions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tripelennamine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to tripelennamine or other antihistamines, premature or full-term neonates, those concurrently using monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), individuals with severe cardiovascular disease, urinary retention, and those with lower respiratory tract symptoms such as asthma.

* **Use with caution:** Exercise caution when using tripelennamine in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, pyloroduodenal obstruction, epilepsy, elderly patients, those with known or suspected QT interval prolongation, and those with hypokalemia or other electrolyte imbalances.

* **Drug interactions:** Tripelennamine can enhance the sedative effects of barbiturates, hypnotics, opioid analgesics, anxiolytic sedatives, and antipsychotics.  It may also have additive antimuscarinic effects with other antimuscarinic drugs and certain antidepressants.  Concomitant use with aminoglycoside antibiotics should be avoided because tripelennamine might mask ototoxicity symptoms.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Tripelennamine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  The effects of excretion in breast milk are unknown.  Non-sedating antihistamines are generally preferred during pregnancy and lactation.
