# Tetrahydrozoline (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Tetrahydrozoline (Nasal)

### Usage
Tetrahydrozoline nasal spray is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion.  It's a decongestant that works by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, making it easier to breathe.  This makes it useful for conditions causing stuffy noses, such as the common cold, allergies, or sinusitis.  It's important to note that tetrahydrozoline only treats the *symptoms* of nasal congestion; it doesn't address the underlying cause of the congestion itself.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For nasal congestion, the usual dose is 2-4 drops or 3-4 sprays of 0.1% solution into each nostril every 3-4 hours as needed, but no more often than every 3 hours.

**Children:** Dosage for children varies significantly depending on age and the concentration of the solution.  A 0.5% solution is contraindicated (should not be used) in children under 2 years old, and a 0.1% solution is contraindicated in children under 6 years old.  For children aged 2-6 years, a 0.05% solution may be used, with 2-3 drops in each nostril every 4-6 hours as needed, but not more frequently than every 3 hours. Children over 6 years old can typically use the adult dosage of the 0.1% solution.

**Important Note:**  Always follow the specific instructions on the product label, and consult a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about the appropriate dosage for your child or yourself.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Sneezing, burning or stinging sensation in the nose.
* **Less Common but Possible:** Headache, increased blood pressure, palpitations (rapid heartbeat), tachycardia (fast heart rate), tremor, blurred vision.

If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Tetrahydrozoline is an alpha-adrenergic agonist.  This means it works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal lining. This stimulation causes the blood vessels to constrict (narrow), reducing blood flow and swelling in the nasal passages.  The resulting decrease in swelling relieves nasal congestion.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tetrahydrozoline nasal spray should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to tetrahydrozoline or any of the product's ingredients. It should also not be used in children under 2 years of age (for 0.5% solution) or under 6 years of age (for 0.1% solution).  Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) should also avoid using this medication.
* **Interactions:**  Using tetrahydrozoline nasal spray concurrently with MAOIs can significantly increase blood pressure.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in individuals with cardiovascular disease (high blood pressure, coronary artery disease), endocrine disorders (diabetes, hyperthyroidism), and in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  The safety and efficacy in pregnant or breastfeeding women have not been fully established.
* **Prolonged Use:** Prolonged use of nasal decongestants can lead to rebound congestion, where the nasal congestion worsens after the medication wears off.  If symptoms persist for more than 7 days, or if they worsen, consult a healthcare professional.
