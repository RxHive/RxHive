# Timothy Grass Pollen Allergen Extract
### Generic Name
Timothy Grass Pollen Allergen Extract

### Usage
Timothy grass pollen allergen extract is a form of immunotherapy used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the eye's conjunctiva) caused by Timothy grass pollen.  It's specifically indicated for individuals who have a confirmed allergy to Timothy grass pollen, usually demonstrated through a positive skin prick test or a positive blood test for Timothy grass-specific IgE antibodies. This treatment is designed to desensitize the individual over time, reducing the severity of their allergic reaction. It is *not* intended for immediate relief of allergy symptoms; rather, it's a preventative measure used before the pollen season begins.  The extract is approved for use in people aged 5 to 65 years.

### Dosage
**Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever) induced by Grass Pollen:**

* **Adults (≤ 65 years):** One tablet (2800 BAU - bioequivalent allergy units) once daily (OD) sublingually (under the tongue). Treatment should begin at least 12 weeks before the anticipated start of each grass pollen season and continue throughout the season. For ongoing effectiveness, daily treatment may be continued for 3 consecutive years, including the periods between pollen seasons.  The first dose must be administered in a healthcare setting due to the risk of allergic reactions.

* **Children (≥ 5 years):** The dosage is the same as for adults.

**Important Note:**  The safety and efficacy of this medication have not been established for children under 5 years of age or for initiating treatment during the pollen season.  No dosage adjustments are specified for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works
Timothy grass pollen allergen extract works through specific immunotherapy (SIT). The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve a shift in the body's immune response.  Specifically, it changes the balance from a T-helper 2 (Th2) response (which promotes allergic inflammation) to a T-helper 1 (Th1) response (which helps to suppress the allergy). This involves changes in cytokine production (interleukins), increased production of IgG blocking antibodies that compete with IgE for allergen binding,  the proliferation of regulatory T-lymphocytes, and a decrease in the activity of mast cells and eosinophils (allergy-related cells). Ultimately, this aims to reduce the intensity of the early and late-phase allergic responses.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to any ingredient in the formulation, severe, unstable, or uncontrolled asthma, a history of severe systemic allergic reactions, a history of severe local reactions to sublingual immunotherapy, or a history of eosinophilic esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus).

* **Warnings:** There is a boxed warning about severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis and laryngopharyngeal restriction), emphasizing the need for careful monitoring, especially after the initial dose.  Epinephrine auto-injectors must be readily available and patients should be properly trained on their use.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Allergen immunotherapy is generally not started during pregnancy. The safety of use during breastfeeding is unknown.

* **Interactions:** No significant known drug interactions are reported.

* **General Precautions:** The first dose should always be given in a medical setting.  Patients should be instructed on proper administration (sublingual) and warned to avoid food and drink for 5 minutes afterward. Treatment should be interrupted if oral inflammation or wounds are present.  Immunotherapy should be stopped during acute asthma exacerbations.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?**  A:  This is not a quick-relief medication.  It takes several weeks or months of consistent treatment to see a significant reduction in symptoms. The full effect is generally seen after completing a full course of treatment over several years.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention. Have an epinephrine auto-injector readily available and know how to use it.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other allergy medications?** A:  Consult your doctor or allergist. While no significant interactions are known,  it's always best to discuss all medications you are taking.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Follow the instructions on the product packaging.

* **Q: Is this treatment a cure for allergies?** A: No, this is a form of immunotherapy to manage the symptoms of allergies, not a cure.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or allergist.  Generally, if a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible unless it is very close to the next scheduled dose.  Do not take a double dose.
