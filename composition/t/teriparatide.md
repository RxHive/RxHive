# Teriparatide

**Generic Name:** Teriparatide

**Usage:**

Teriparatide is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fracture.  It's specifically indicated for those who have already experienced an osteoporotic fracture or have multiple risk factors for fracture.  It increases bone mass and reduces the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures.  Treatment is typically for a limited duration (up to 24 months) as long-term continuous use is not recommended.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A frequent complaint.
* **Nausea:** Can range from mild discomfort to more significant upset stomach.
* **Dizziness:**  May lead to lightheadedness or unsteadiness.
* **Leg cramps:** Often reported as muscular pain and spasms.
* **Pain at the injection site:** Redness, swelling, or discomfort at the injection location.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium):**  Requires medical attention.  Symptoms can include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and increased urination.
* **Syncope (fainting):**  Requires immediate attention.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can lead to dizziness and fainting.
* **Osteosarcoma (bone cancer):**  A rare but serious risk, primarily in patients with pre-existing risk factors or who are taking the medication for an extended period, exceeding the recommended duration.


**How it Works:**

Teriparatide is a parathyroid hormone (PTH) analog.  It works by stimulating bone formation.  Unlike other osteoporosis treatments that primarily slow bone resorption (breakdown), teriparatide directly increases the activity of osteoblasts, the cells responsible for building new bone.  This leads to an increase in bone mineral density, making bones stronger and less prone to fracture.  It's important to note that the mechanism of action involves intermittent PTH stimulation; continuous exposure to high levels of PTH can have the opposite effect.

**FAQs:**

* **How is teriparatide administered?** Teriparatide is administered via daily subcutaneous injection (under the skin).
* **How long does it take to work?**  Benefits in bone mineral density are typically seen within a few months, but the full effect on fracture risk reduction may take longer.
* **What are the contraindications?**  Patients with certain bone cancers, hypercalcemia, or a history of hypersensitivity to teriparatide should not use this medication.
* **Can I take teriparatide with other medications?**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
* **What are the long-term effects?**  Long-term continuous use is not recommended.  After the recommended treatment period, a transition to another osteoporosis medication may be necessary.
* **Is teriparatide covered by insurance?**  Coverage varies depending on your insurance plan.  Check with your provider for details.
