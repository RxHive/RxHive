# Teriparatide
### Generic Name
Teriparatide

### Usage
Teriparatide is primarily used to treat osteoporosis in adults.  Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Postmenopausal women:**  Those at high risk for fractures.
* **Men:** Individuals with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fractures.
* **Men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis:** This refers to osteoporosis caused by long-term use of glucocorticoid medications (like prednisone), and again, only those at high risk of fractures.

The drug's main goal is to improve bone mass and reduce the risk of fractures.  It's not a cure for osteoporosis, but rather a treatment to strengthen bones and prevent future fractures.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Teriparatide is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily. The usual dose is 20 mcg daily for up to 2 years.  It's crucial to note that treatment should not exceed 2 years in a patient's lifetime.  Following the teriparatide course, a healthcare provider will typically initiate antiresorptive therapy (such as bisphosphonates) to help maintain bone density gains.  Adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation is also usually recommended if dietary intake is insufficient.  A serum calcium level should be checked before starting treatment to rule out hypercalcemia.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of teriparatide in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are usually necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to current prescribing information. However, individual cases may warrant closer monitoring by a physician.

**Administration:**  The medication is typically injected into the thigh or abdomen. It can be given at any time of day, regardless of meals.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels). This is the most common side effect and requires monitoring.

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Vertigo
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Angina pectoris (chest pain)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal membranes)
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Pneumonia
* Nausea
* Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Vomiting
* Development of antibodies to the drug
* Herpes zoster (shingles)
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Weakness
* Leg cramps

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1%, often reported post-marketing):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, or throat)
* Acute dyspnea
* Severe hypersensitivity reactions
* Injection site reactions (bruising, pain, swelling)
* Muscle spasm
* Osteosarcoma (a rare type of bone cancer â€“ see Precautions)
* Urticaria (hives)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, it is vital to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Teriparatide is a synthetic form of parathyroid hormone (PTH).  PTH plays a key role in regulating calcium levels in the body and bone metabolism. Teriparatide acts by binding to receptors on bone cells (osteoblasts), stimulating bone formation.  This leads to increased bone mass and density, thus strengthening bones and reducing the risk of fractures.  It also improves calcium absorption from the gut and reduces calcium excretion by the kidneys.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Teriparatide should *not* be used in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to teriparatide or any of its components.
* Pre-existing hypercalcemia (high blood calcium).
* Metabolic bone diseases other than osteoporosis (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, Paget's disease).
* Unexplained elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels.
* Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy to the skeleton.
* Bone metastases (cancer spread to bones).
* History of skeletal malignancies.
* Children or young adults with open epiphyses (growth plates).
* Active kidney stones (urolithiasis).


**Warnings and Cautions:**

* **Osteosarcoma Risk:**  Studies in animals have shown an increased risk of osteosarcoma (a type of bone cancer) with teriparatide.  The relevance to humans is uncertain, but this risk must be considered.  Teriparatide should only be prescribed when the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Patients with an increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma should not use this medication.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Teriparatide is a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning the risks to the fetus are unknown.  It should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation. Effective contraception is essential for women of childbearing age.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The effects of teriparatide may be reduced when used with bisphosphonates (another class of osteoporosis medication). Concurrent use should generally be avoided.  Caution is needed when teriparatide is used with digoxin (a heart medication) as it can increase serum calcium levels, potentially leading to digoxin toxicity.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:**  Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease due to the potential risk of orthostatic hypotension.
* **Hypercalcemia:**  Monitor calcium levels regularly during treatment to detect and manage hypercalcemia.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I take teriparatide?**  A:  The typical treatment duration is up to 2 years, and it's generally not recommended to exceed this amount in a lifetime. Your physician will determine the appropriate duration based on your individual needs.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store teriparatide?** A: Store it in the refrigerator.

* **Q:  Can I use teriparatide with other medications?** A:  Discuss all your medications with your doctor before starting teriparatide, especially bisphosphonates and digoxin.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of teriparatide?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully understood, but it's important to carefully follow your doctor's instructions and get regular monitoring.

* **Q: Is teriparatide safe for everyone?** A:  No, teriparatide has several contraindications and precautions, so it's crucial to discuss your medical history with your physician to determine its suitability.
