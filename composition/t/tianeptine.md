# Tianeptine
### Generic Name
Tianeptine

### Usage
Tianeptine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder.  It's a tricyclic antidepressant, though its mechanism of action differs from many other antidepressants in this class.  While its primary use is for depression,  it's important to note that this information is for general knowledge and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for self-treatment. Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Major Depressive Disorder):**  The typical starting dose is 12.5 mg three times daily (TID), taken once in the morning, once midday, and once in the evening.  This dosage should be reduced gradually over 7-14 days when discontinuing treatment.  In older adults (geriatric patients), the daily dose should be limited to 25 mg.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Tianeptine in children have not been established. It should not be given to children or adolescents under 15 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, dosage adjustments are generally not needed, however, for severe impairment, a dose of 12.5 mg twice daily (BID) is recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Similar to hepatic impairment, adjustments are typically not needed for mild to moderate kidney impairment. However, reduce the dose to 12.5 mg BID in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Switching from/to MAOIs:**  A 14-day washout period is recommended between discontinuing a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and starting Tianeptine.  Conversely, wait 24 hours after stopping Tianeptine before starting an MAOI.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Nervous system effects: Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, nightmares, confusion,  shivers, feelings of choking, hallucinations, suicidal ideation.
* Cardiovascular effects: Chest pain, increased heart rate (tachycardia), extrasystoles.
* Respiratory effects: Shortness of breath (dyspnea), throat irritation.
* Dermatological effects: Skin rashes (erythematous, maculopapular, bullous), itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria), acne.
* Gastrointestinal effects: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, flatulence, loss of appetite (anorexia), dry mouth (xerostomia).
* Hepatic effects: Increased liver enzymes, hepatitis.
* Endocrine and metabolic effects: Hot flashes, low sodium levels (hyponatremia).
* Neuromuscular and skeletal effects: Back pain, muscle pain (myalgia), tremors, weakness, dyskinesia.

Less common but serious side effects can also occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, it's vital to contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Tianeptine's exact mechanism isn't fully understood.  It's believed that its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects are due to its interaction with the μ-opioid receptor, ultimately leading to modulation of the brain's glutamatergic systems.  However, research continues to clarify its precise mode of action.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Tianeptine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components,  children and adolescents under 15 years old, and those currently taking or who have recently stopped taking (within 14 days) MAOIs.  A 24-hour washout period is necessary if switching from Tianeptine to an MAOI.

**Warnings:** Tianeptine may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, especially when starting treatment or adjusting dosage. It can also lead to drug dependence or abuse.  Caution is advised in patients with neurological disorders, renal or hepatic impairment, elderly individuals, and those with a history of drug abuse or alcoholism. Concurrent use with general anesthetics should also be approached with caution.

**Interactions:**  Concurrent use with MAOIs is strongly contraindicated.  The combination of Tianeptine and mianserin should be avoided as mianserin might decrease Tianeptine’s effectiveness.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Tianeptine during pregnancy is unknown. It's generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as it's excreted in breast milk.

### FAQs
