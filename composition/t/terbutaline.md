# Terbutaline

**Generic Name:** Terbutaline Sulfate

**Usage:**

Terbutaline is a bronchodilator used to treat or prevent bronchospasm in people with reversible obstructive airway disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's primarily used for short-term relief of symptoms and is often administered via inhaler or injection (subcutaneous or intravenous).  It may also be used to delay premature labor in pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery, although this use is becoming less common due to potential risks.  **Important note:** Terbutaline is not a first-line treatment for asthma or COPD and should only be used under a doctor's supervision.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Tremors:**  This is a frequently reported side effect, particularly with higher doses.
* **Headache:** Can range from mild to moderate.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):**  Can be significant and potentially dangerous.
* **Muscle cramps:**  Often in the legs.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Dizziness:**  Lightheadedness or feeling faint.
* **Nervousness:**  Feeling anxious or jittery.
* **Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar):** More likely in people with diabetes.
* **Hypokalemia (low potassium):** Can be dangerous in severe cases.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat):**  Potentially life-threatening.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Seizures:**  Rare but serious.
* **Angina (chest pain):**  Especially in patients with heart conditions.


**How it Works:**

Terbutaline is a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.  This means it works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs.  This relaxation opens up the airways, making it easier to breathe.  In the context of preventing premature labor, it's believed to relax the uterine muscles, reducing contractions.

**FAQs:**

* **Is terbutaline safe for pregnant women?** While it *can* be used to delay preterm labor, its use is controversial due to potential risks to both the mother and the baby, including increased heart rate in both, and potentially low blood sugar in the baby.  There are safer alternatives often preferred now.  A doctor should carefully weigh the risks and benefits.

* **Can I use terbutaline long-term?** No, it's not intended for long-term use.  Continuous use can lead to decreased effectiveness and increase the risk of side effects.  It's typically used for short-term relief of symptoms or in specific situations like delaying premature labor.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as chest pain, severe dizziness, irregular heartbeat, or seizures.  Even seemingly minor side effects should be reported to your doctor
