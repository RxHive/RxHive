# Tricarbocyanine
### Generic Name
Tricarbocyanine (Indocyanine Green)

### Usage
Tricarbocyanine, specifically Indocyanine Green (ICG), is a dye used primarily as a diagnostic agent. Its main applications are:

* **Cardiac Output Determination:** ICG is injected into the bloodstream, and its dilution curve is monitored to calculate the heart's output. This helps assess the efficiency of the heart's pumping action.
* **Hepatic Function Assessment:**  By injecting ICG and monitoring its clearance from the blood, healthcare professionals can evaluate liver function and blood flow within the liver. This helps diagnose liver diseases and assess their severity.
* **Ophthalmic Angiography:**  ICG is used in ophthalmology to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. This is crucial for diagnosing and managing various eye conditions, including retinal vascular diseases.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific application (cardiac output, hepatic function, or ophthalmic angiography) and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.

**Cardiac Output Determination:**

* **Adults:** 5 mg injected rapidly via a cardiac catheter. The maximum total dose is 2 mg/kg.
* **Children:** Dosage depends on age and weight;  1.25 mg (infants) or 2.5 mg (children and adolescents) injected rapidly via a cardiac catheter. The maximum total dose remains 2 mg/kg.  

**Hepatic Function Assessment:**

* **Adults and Children:** 0.5 mg/kg injected rapidly into an arm vein while the patient is fasting.

**Ophthalmic Angiography:**

* **Adults:** Up to 40 mg (the exact amount depends on equipment and technique) administered intravenously via the antecubital vein, immediately followed by a 5 mL saline flush.  Pediatric dosages are not standardized in this application and must be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Important Note:**  For all applications, doses are typically given in a 1 mL volume.  For cardiac catheterization, flushing the catheter with saline solution after dye injection is crucial to prevent hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells).

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Green-colored feces
* Itching (pruritus)
* Hives (urticaria)
* Sweating (diaphoresis)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* **Anaphylaxis:** A severe allergic reaction that requires immediate medical attention.  This is more of a concern during cardiac catheterization procedures.


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tricarbocyanine/Indocyanine Green is a dye that absorbs and emits light at specific wavelengths.  This property allows it to be detected using specialized equipment.  In cardiac output determination, the rate at which the dye dilutes in the bloodstream provides information on blood flow and cardiac output. In hepatic function assessment, the rate at which the liver clears the dye from the blood reflects liver function. In ophthalmic angiography, the dye highlights blood vessels, enabling visualization.  The dye's clearance from the bloodstream is dependent upon liver function.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to iodides is a contraindication.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of anaphylaxis, particularly during cardiac catheterization.
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of iodine allergy, pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Radioactive iodine uptake studies should be avoided for at least one week after ICG use. Preparations containing sodium bisulfite, some heparin products, can interfere with ICG absorption and should not be used concurrently.
* **Stability:** ICG solutions are unstable in aqueous solution and should be used within 6 hours of preparation. It is stable in plasma and whole blood.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Tricarbocyanine stored?** A:  Specific storage instructions will be provided with the medication. Generally, it should be stored in accordance with good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical preparations.

* **Q: Is Tricarbocyanine safe during pregnancy?** A:  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only used when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's classified as Category C for pregnancy risk, meaning studies in animals have shown adverse effects but there are no adequate studies in humans.

* **Q: Can I breastfeed while using Tricarbocyanine?** A: The excretion of Tricarbocyanine in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use with caution during breastfeeding.  Consult your physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Stop using the medication and contact your healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention, especially if you experience a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).

* **Q:  How long does it take for Tricarbocyanine to be eliminated from the body?** A: The elimination time varies depending on liver function and other factors, but it is typically cleared within a few hours.
