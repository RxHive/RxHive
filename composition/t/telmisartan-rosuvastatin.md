# Telmisartan + Rosuvastatin
### Generic Name
Telmisartan + Rosuvastatin

### Usage

Telmisartan + Rosuvastatin is a combination medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) simultaneously.  It combines two active ingredients: telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and rosuvastatin, a statin.

Telmisartan works by relaxing blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.  Rosuvastatin lowers cholesterol levels in the blood by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for cholesterol production in the liver.  By combining these two medications, this fixed-dose combination offers a convenient way to manage both conditions effectively, especially in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack or stroke, often characterized by both high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  The combination therapy is generally prescribed when lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise) haven’t been sufficient to control both conditions.


### Dosage

Dosage of Telmisartan + Rosuvastatin combinations varies depending on the specific product formulation (different manufacturers might offer different ratios of telmisartan and rosuvastatin).  Always follow the prescription provided by your doctor.  There isn't a standard pediatric dosage for this combination; it's usually not prescribed for children.


**Dosage Examples (Illustrative – Always follow your doctor's instructions):**

A common example might be a tablet containing 80mg of Telmisartan and 10mg of Rosuvastatin.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your individual needs and response to the medication.  The dosage may be adjusted gradually.  This combination medication is only available in oral tablet form.  It's typically taken once daily, usually at the same time each day, with or without food.

**Important Note:**  Never adjust the dosage yourself.  Changes in dosage should only be made under the guidance of your healthcare provider.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Upper respiratory infection
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Back pain
* Fatigue


Less common, but serious side effects that require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver damage (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain)
* Muscle weakness or pain (especially if accompanied by fever or dark urine – this could indicate rhabdomyolysis, a serious condition)
* Swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs


If you experience any of these side effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, telmisartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.  Rosuvastatin reduces cholesterol levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme crucial in the liver's production of cholesterol.  This leads to lower levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol and triglycerides, and potentially increased levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol. The combined effect lowers blood pressure and cholesterol, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by those with known hypersensitivity to telmisartan, rosuvastatin, or any of the excipients.  It’s also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination may interact with many other drugs. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some notable interactions can occur with other blood pressure medications, certain antibiotics, antifungals, and medications affecting the liver.

* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** This medication is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed in older adults due to potential increased sensitivity.

* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Caution is advised in patients with liver or kidney problems.  Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function may be necessary.

* **Muscle Problems:**  Muscle pain or weakness should be reported immediately.  The risk of rhabdomyolysis, a serious condition affecting the muscles, is increased with statins.

* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided as it may increase the risk of liver damage.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with food?** A:  This combination can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effects on blood pressure usually begin to show within a few weeks.  Cholesterol-lowering effects may take longer.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and light, as directed on the label.
