# Thiothixene
### Generic Name
Thiothixene

### Usage
Thiothixene is a first-generation antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia.  Its primary function is to manage the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. While not its primary indication, it may also be used for short-term rapid tranquilization of agitated patients.  It's important to note that thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the severity of the condition and the patient's response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.  The following information is for general understanding and should not substitute professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia (Mild to Moderate):**  Oral administration typically starts at 2 mg three times daily (TID). The daily dose may be increased gradually, as tolerated, up to a maximum of 15 mg/day.
* **Schizophrenia (Severe):** Oral administration usually begins at 5 mg twice daily (BID).  The maintenance dose can range from 20-30 mg/day, with a maximum daily dose of 60 mg.
* **Rapid Tranquilization:**  For rapidly calming agitated patients, oral doses of 5-10 mg may be given every 30-60 minutes, but the total daily dose shouldn't exceed 30 mg.

**Children and Adolescents:**

Use in children and adolescents is generally limited to those aged 12 years and older. Dosage is similar to that of adults, but always under strict medical supervision and careful monitoring.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A physician should carefully consider the patient's individual condition and adjust accordingly.

### Side Effects

Thiothixene, like other antipsychotics, can cause various side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Weight gain
* Restlessness or anxiety

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):  These include muscle rigidity, tremors, involuntary movements (akathisia, dystonia), and pseudoparkinsonism.
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* Tardive dyskinesia:  A potentially irreversible movement disorder characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements.
* Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)
* Cardiac issues (rare but potentially life-threatening)

**Important:** If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed as serious, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Thiothixene is a thioxanthene derivative that blocks dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in various brain functions, including movement, mood, and thought processes. By blocking dopamine receptors, thiothixene helps reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly hallucinations and delusions.  It also possesses alpha-adrenergic blocking activity, contributing to some of its side effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Thiothixene is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components, severe CNS depression, coma, circulatory collapse, or blood dyscrasias.
* **Interactions:** Thiothixene can interact with numerous other medications, including antidepressants, antihypertensives, and other CNS depressants.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Thiothixene is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects are unknown.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using this medication.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis are at increased risk of death when taking antipsychotics.  Thiothixene is not approved for this use.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney problems, seizure disorders, or those with a history of EPS or tardive dyskinesia.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking thiothixene?**  A: No. Alcohol can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.
* **Q: Can I drive while taking thiothixene?** A:  Drowsiness is a common side effect. Do not drive or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
* **Q: How should I store thiothixene?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture, as directed on the label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking thiothixene suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking thiothixene abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden withdrawal can lead to serious problems.
