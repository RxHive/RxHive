# Tedizolid
### Generic Name
Tedizolid

### Usage
Tedizolid is an antibiotic used to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  This includes infections such as cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections. It's a second-generation oxazolidinone, meaning it works differently than many other antibiotics, making it effective against some bacteria resistant to other treatments.  Currently, it's primarily used for ABSSSI and doesn't have widespread secondary uses.

### Dosage

**Adults (18 years and older) and Pediatric Patients (≥12 years):**

* **Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI):** The recommended dose is 200 mg once daily (OD) for 6 days.  This can be administered either orally (as a tablet) or intravenously (IV) as a 1-hour infusion.  If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, but within 8 hours of the next scheduled dose.  Do not take a double dose.

**Children (<12 years):**

* The safety and effectiveness of tedizolid have not been established in children younger than 12 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Rash (pruritus, urticaria)
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridioides difficile* colitis (severe diarrhea)
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in extremities)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Serious allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)
* Optic neuropathy (damage to the optic nerve)

**Important Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, especially severe diarrhea or neurological symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tedizolid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it stops bacteria from multiplying rather than killing them directly.  It achieves this by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacterial ribosomes. This action prevents the formation of the 70S initiation complex, which is essential for bacterial protein synthesis.  By inhibiting protein synthesis, tedizolid effectively halts bacterial growth and allows the body's immune system to clear the infection.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Tedizolid should not be used in patients with a known allergy to tedizolid or other oxazolidinones.
* **Neutropenia:** Tedizolid is not recommended for patients with severely low neutrophil counts (less than 1000 cells/mm³). Alternative therapies should be considered in such cases.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Tedizolid may interact with other medications. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting tedizolid. Several interactions are listed in the detailed product information, focusing on those that significantly impact the efficacy and safety profile of tedizolid or its co-administered medication.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tedizolid is classified as pregnancy category C. This means that the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in certain situations, but it should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.  It is unknown if tedizolid is excreted in breast milk, therefore, caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Infections:** Tedizolid can increase the risk of fungal or bacterial superinfections.  Close monitoring for any signs of new or worsening infections is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take tedizolid with food?** A:  The oral formulation can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store tedizolid?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, antibiotics should be stored at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but only if it's within 8 hours of your next scheduled dose. Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking tedizolid early if I feel better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the full course of treatment, even if you feel better, to prevent the infection from returning and to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: Is tedizolid safe for everyone?** A: Tedizolid is generally safe for adults and children 12 years and older when used as directed.  However, precautions should be taken for patients with certain medical conditions, like those with liver or kidney problems or low white blood cell counts. Always consult your doctor before taking any medication.
