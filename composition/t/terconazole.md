# Terconazole
### Generic Name
Terconazole

### Usage
Terconazole is a topical antifungal medication primarily used to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (a yeast infection of the vagina and vulva).  This condition is commonly caused by the fungus *Candida albicans*.  While its primary use is in treating vaginal yeast infections, it's specifically formulated for topical application and isn't typically used to treat other fungal infections elsewhere in the body.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (cream or suppository) and the concentration of terconazole.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and the instructions provided with the medication.

**Adults:**

* **Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (Yeast Infection):**
    * **0.4% Cream:** One full applicator (usually about 5 grams) is inserted into the vagina at bedtime for seven consecutive days.
    * **0.8% Cream:** One full applicator is inserted into the vagina at bedtime for three consecutive days.
    * **80 mg Suppository:** One suppository is inserted into the vagina at bedtime for three consecutive days.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of terconazole in children have not been established. It should not be used in children unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a pediatrician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Headache
* Chills
* Pain
* Abdominal pain
* Vaginal burning, irritation, or itching
* Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)
* Fever

Less common, but more serious side effects that require immediate medical attention include:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, rash, hives, swelling)
* Bronchospasm
* Dizziness
* Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a severe skin reaction)


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Terconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent. It works by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By disrupting ergosterol production, terconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, ultimately leading to the death of the fungus and resolving the infection.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Terconazole should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to terconazole or any components of the medication.
* **Latex/Rubber Interaction:** Avoid using rubber or latex condoms, diaphragms, or other devices during treatment with terconazole, as the medication's base may interact with these materials.  Consult your doctor for alternative contraception methods during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Terconazole is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there is no adequate data in pregnant women.  The use of terconazole during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. It's unknown whether terconazole is excreted in breast milk; therefore, caution is advised when using it during breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:**  While specific interactions aren't extensively documented, inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to rule out potential interactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Improvement in symptoms is usually seen within a few days of starting treatment. However, complete resolution may take the full course of treatment (3-7 days).

* **Q: Can I use terconazole if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Consult your doctor before using terconazole during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store terconazole?** A:  Store terconazole at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I use other vaginal products with terconazole?** A:  Avoid using other vaginal products concurrently unless otherwise advised by your doctor.

* **Q:  What if my symptoms don't improve after treatment?** A: If your symptoms persist or worsen after completing the prescribed course of treatment, consult your healthcare provider for further evaluation.  The infection may require a different treatment approach.
