# Tazarotene
### Generic Name
Tazarotene

### Usage
Tazarotene is a topical retinoid primarily used to treat acne vulgaris (common acne) and plaque psoriasis.  It's also used as an adjunctive therapy to improve the appearance of facial fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation (dark spots), hypopigmentation (light spots), and benign facial lentigines (freckles) in adults 17 years and older.  This adjunctive use requires a comprehensive skincare routine and sun avoidance.  It's crucial to understand that tazarotene doesn't cure these conditions but helps manage symptoms and improve their appearance.

### Dosage

**Acne Vulgaris:**

* **Lotion (0.045%):** Apply a thin layer once daily (OD) to affected areas.
* **Foam (0.1%):** Apply a small amount once daily in the evening to affected areas.
* **Cream/Gel (0.1%):** Apply a thin layer (approximately 2 mg/cm²) once daily in the evening to affected areas.

**Plaque Psoriasis:**

* **Cream/Gel (0.05% or 0.1%):** Begin with 0.05%. Apply a thin film (2 mg/cm²) once daily to psoriatic lesions only.  The strength may be increased to 0.1% if tolerated and necessary.  Apply to no more than 20% of the body surface area in children.

For psoriasis, use in children 12 and older starts at 0.05% and may increase to 0.1% as tolerated.

### How it Works

Tazarotene is a retinoid, a derivative of vitamin A. It works by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) in the skin cells.  This binding affects how skin cells grow and differentiate, reducing inflammation and helping to unclog pores in the case of acne.  For psoriasis, it helps regulate the rapid growth of skin cells that characterizes this condition. In the case of wrinkles and pigmentation issues, tazarotene’s effects on cell growth and turnover contribute to improved skin texture and appearance.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Tazarotene is contraindicated in pregnancy (Category X), hypersensitivity to tazarotene or other retinoids, and individuals with eczema.
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known, but it's essential to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and mucous membranes.  Use sunscreen daily and wear protective clothing, as tazarotene increases sun sensitivity.  Avoid using on sunburned, abraded, broken, or eczematous skin.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment.
