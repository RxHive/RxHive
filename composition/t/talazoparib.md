# Talazoparib
### Generic Name
Talazoparib

### Usage
Talazoparib is a medication classified as a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.  Its primary use is in the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline *BRCA* mutation-associated (gBRCAm) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  This means it's used for a specific type of breast cancer in adults whose cancer cells have a genetic mutation (in the *BRCA* genes) and do not overexpress HER2.  The presence of the *BRCA* mutation is confirmed via an approved test before treatment.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The standard oral dose for adults with gBRCAm, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer is 1 mg once daily.  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).  For CrCl 30-59 mL/min, the dose is reduced to 0.75 mg once daily; for CrCl 15-29 mL/min, it's reduced to 0.5 mg once daily.  No specific dose adjustment is provided for CrCl <15 mL/min or patients on hemodialysis.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild hepatic impairment (slightly elevated liver enzymes), no dosage adjustment is typically needed.  However, guidance for moderate or severe hepatic impairment is not explicitly provided in the current labeling.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reduction (to 0.75 mg, 0.5 mg, or 0.25 mg once daily) or temporary treatment interruption may be necessary depending on the severity of side effects.  Treatment should be discontinued if more than three dose reductions are required.  Specific guidelines for withholding the drug based on low blood counts (hemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets) are outlined in the prescribing information.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of talazoparib have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Administration:** Talazoparib capsules should be swallowed whole; do not open or crush them.  The medication can be taken with or without food.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Talazoparib is a PARP inhibitor.  PARP enzymes are involved in DNA repair within cells. By inhibiting these enzymes, talazoparib prevents cancer cells, particularly those with *BRCA* mutations (which already have impaired DNA repair mechanisms), from repairing damaged DNA.  This leads to increased DNA damage, hindering cell growth and ultimately causing the cancer cells to die (apoptosis).


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** There are currently no absolute contraindications listed in the official prescribing information.
* **Drug Interactions:** Talazoparib can interact with other medications.  Discuss all medications you are taking (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements) with your doctor or pharmacist.  Certain medications might increase or decrease the levels or effects of talazoparib, or vice versa.  Examples include some medications affecting the liver or kidneys and several others not listed here.  It's crucial to review the complete list of potential interactions before starting talazoparib.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Talazoparib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 7 months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.
* **Myelosuppression:** Talazoparib can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to decreased blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). Regular blood tests are essential to monitor for this.
* **Other Risks:**  There is an increased risk of AML and MDS with talazoparib use.  Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of these conditions is necessary.  Gastrointestinal side effects are also common.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take talazoparib with food?**  A: Yes, talazoparib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take an extra dose to make up for a missed dose.  Take the next dose as scheduled.

* **Q: How should I store talazoparib?** A: Store talazoparib at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Refer to the specific storage instructions on the medication label.

* **Q: Are there any specific precautions for handling talazoparib?** A: Yes, wear gloves while handling the medication to avoid potential exposure.  This is due to the medicationâ€™s potential for carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, teratogenicity, and genotoxicity.

* **Q: How long will I be on talazoparib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your individual response to the medication and the progression of your disease.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
