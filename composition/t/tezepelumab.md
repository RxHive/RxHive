# Tezepelumab
### Generic Name
Tezepelumab

### Usage
Tezepelumab is a medication used as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  It's crucial to understand that Tezepelumab is *not* for treating acute asthma attacks (like sudden shortness of breath) or severe, life-threatening asthma episodes (status asthmaticus).  Its role is to help manage the underlying inflammation and prevent asthma exacerbations in individuals with already severe disease who haven't had adequate control with other treatments.


### Dosage

**Adults and Children â‰¥12 years:** The recommended dose is 210 mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once every four weeks.  This is the same dosage for both adults and children 12 years of age and older.  The safety and efficacy of Tezepelumab have not been established in children younger than 12.

**Administration:** Tezepelumab is given as a subcutaneous injection.  The injection sites should be rotated (upper arm, thigh, or lower abdomen, avoiding areas within 2 inches of the navel).  Avoid injecting into areas of the skin that are tender, bruised, red, or hardened. The medication should be allowed to reach room temperature before administration.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, adjustments are generally considered unnecessary because Tezepelumab isn't primarily metabolized by the liver or eliminated by the kidneys.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Development of antibodies against Tezepelumab
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain

Less common but serious side effects are possible.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Tezepelumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). TSLP is a protein involved in triggering inflammation in the airways, a key feature of asthma. By preventing TSLP from interacting with its receptor, Tezepelumab helps reduce airway inflammation, leading to fewer asthma exacerbations and improved lung function.  While the exact mechanisms are still being fully elucidated, the reduction in inflammatory markers like eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) and certain cytokines (signaling proteins) is a significant part of its effect.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Tezepelumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components.  Patients should be monitored for hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Corticosteroids:**  Do not stop taking systemic or inhaled corticosteroids suddenly when starting Tezepelumab.  Any dose reduction should be gradual and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
* **Live Vaccines:**  Avoid live attenuated vaccines while receiving Tezepelumab.
* **Parasitic Infections:**  It is unknown how Tezepelumab may affect the immune response to parasitic infections.  Patients with existing helminth (worm) infections should be treated before starting Tezepelumab.  Those who develop infections during treatment may need to discontinue the medication until the infection resolves.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tezepelumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody and crosses the placenta.  The decision to breastfeed during treatment should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, weighing the potential risk to the infant against the benefits of breastfeeding and Tezepelumab therapy.
