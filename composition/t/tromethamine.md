# Tromethamine
### Generic Name
Tromethamine

### Usage

Tromethamine, also known as tromethamol, is primarily used as an alkalinizing agent to correct metabolic acidosis.  Metabolic acidosis is a condition where there's too much acid in the body's fluids.  This medication is particularly indicated in several specific situations:

* **Cardiac arrest:**  Following cardiac arrest, the body can experience metabolic acidosis. Tromethamine helps restore the body's acid-base balance.
* **Cardiac bypass surgery:** During this type of surgery, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass can lead to metabolic acidosis. Tromethamine is used to counteract this.
* **Acid citrate dextrose (ACD) blood preservation:**  Blood stored using ACD solutions can become acidic. Tromethamine is added to neutralize the acidity before transfusion.
* **Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in neonates and infants:** In newborns and infants with RDS,  metabolic acidosis can develop. Tromethamine can help correct this acid imbalance.

### Dosage

Dosage of tromethamine varies greatly depending on the specific condition, the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the acidosis.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.  The medication is typically administered intravenously (IV).

**Adults:**

Dosage for adults differs depending on the clinical scenario:

* **Metabolic acidosis during cardiac arrest:** Initial IV dose ranges from 111-333 mL of a 0.3 M solution (3.6-10.8 g).  Further doses might be needed based on ongoing monitoring.  If the chest is open, intraventricular administration (62-185 mL of a 0.3 M solution, 2-6 g) might be used, but it should never be injected into cardiac muscle.
* **Metabolic acidosis during cardiac bypass surgery:** The average dose is around 9 mL/kg (324 mg/kg) of a 0.3 M solution, but this can vary widely.  Up to 1000 mL may be needed in severe cases.  The maximum single dose is 500 mg/kg given over at least an hour.
* **Correction of ACD blood acidity:**  15-77 mL of a 0.3 M solution (0.5-2.5 g) is added to each 500 mL of ACD blood.
* **Known buffer base deficit:**  A more precise calculation exists using the formula: Tromethamine dose (mL of 0.3 M solution) = body weight (kg) x base deficit (mEq/L) x 1.1


**Children:**

Pediatric dosing is complex and highly dependent on the specific clinical situation (e.g., metabolic acidosis associated with RDS or cardiac arrest) and the severity of the acidosis.  Always follow the instructions of a healthcare professional.  Dosages are typically calculated based on the child's weight and the base deficit.  An empiric formula is often used but precise calculations should be performed by a qualified medical professional.


**Important Note:**  Tromethamine is usually administered as a 0.3 M solution.  The rate of administration is crucial; it must be slow to avoid over-correction and potential adverse effects.  Blood pH and clinical status must be carefully monitored throughout treatment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are not always well-documented but the following are possible.  If any of these or other unusual symptoms occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately:

* Localized phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Venospasm (narrowing of a vein)
* Venous thrombosis (blood clot in a vein)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in blood)
* Hypervolemia (excess fluid in the blood)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Hepatic necrosis (rare, liver cell death, reported with umbilical venous catheter administration)
* Injection site infection or irritation
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Respiratory depression (slowed or difficult breathing)
* Fever

Serious, but less common side effects exist, emphasizing the need for close medical supervision during tromethamine administration.

### How it Works

Tromethamine acts as a buffer, meaning it neutralizes acids.  Specifically, it accepts hydrogen ions (H+), thereby reducing the acidity of the blood.  This process helps restore the body's acid-base balance and improves the pH level.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tromethamine is contraindicated in patients with uremia (high levels of urea in the blood), anuria (absence of urine production), or chronic respiratory acidosis in neonates.  It is also contraindicated in neonates with salicylate intoxication.
* **Drug interactions:**  Tromethamine can interact with several other medications, potentially altering their levels in the body.  Inform healthcare providers of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Renal impairment:**  Because tromethamine is mainly excreted by the kidneys, use caution in patients with renal disease.  Close monitoring of ECG and potassium levels is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and lactation:**  Tromethamine is classified as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, blood glucose, and arterial blood gases is essential throughout treatment. Rapid administration must be avoided.  If extravasation (leakage from the vein) occurs, immediately stop the infusion and follow established protocols for management.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I use tromethamine?** A:  Usually, treatment doesn't exceed 24 hours, unless it's a life-threatening situation.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: How is tromethamine stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, it should be stored as directed by the manufacturer.

* **Q: Is tromethamine safe for everyone?** A: No, it is contraindicated in certain conditions (see precautions).  Consult your doctor to determine if it's appropriate for you.

* **Q: Can I take other medications with tromethamine?** A:  This is crucial to discuss with your doctor. It can interact with other drugs.  Don't take other medications without your doctor's approval.
