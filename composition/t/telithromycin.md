# Telithromycin
### Generic Name
Telithromycin

### Usage
Telithromycin is a ketolide antibiotic used primarily to treat mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.  It's important to note that telithromycin is *not* indicated for use in children, and its effectiveness against other bacterial infections is limited.  This medication targets specific bacteria responsible for respiratory infections, effectively combating their growth and reducing the severity of the illness.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical adult dose for treating community-acquired pneumonia is 800 mg once daily (OD) for 7 to 10 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is usually necessary unless the patient also has renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min).
* **Renal Impairment:**
    * CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min: No dosage adjustment is needed.
    * CrCl < 30 mL/min: 600 mg OD.
    * CrCl < 30 mL/min and concomitant hepatic impairment: 400 mg OD.
    * Hemodialysis: 600 mg OD after dialysis on dialysis days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of telithromycin in children have not been established, and it should not be used in pediatric populations.


**Administration:** Telithromycin can be taken with or without food.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 2-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Loose stools

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in <2% of patients):**  These include, but are not limited to:

*  Abnormal liver function tests (including increased transaminase levels)
*  Prolonged QT interval on ECG (potentially leading to serious heart rhythm problems)
*  Acute hepatic failure
*  Severe liver injury (including fulminant hepatitis and hepatic necrosis)
*  Pseudomembranous colitis
*  Anaphylaxis
*  Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis
*  Visual disturbances (blurred vision, diplopia)
*  Syncope (fainting)

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious side effects, stop taking telithromycin and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Telithromycin is a ketolide antibiotic that works by binding to the bacterial ribosome's 50S subunit, specifically to domains II and V of the 23S rRNA.  This inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from multiplying and causing further infection.  It also interferes with the assembly of new ribosomal units.  Additionally, telithromycin affects the secretion of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1α and TNF-α, potentially reducing the inflammatory response to the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Telithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to telithromycin, macrolide antibiotics, or any component of the formulation; myasthenia gravis; a history of hepatitis or jaundice associated with telithromycin or other macrolides; and concomitant use with certain medications (see interactions).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Telithromycin can interact with numerous drugs, affecting their metabolism and efficacy.  This includes interactions with numerous medications including many CYP3A4 substrates and inhibitors,  QT-prolonging agents,  and certain anti-cancer drugs, leading to potential increased toxicity or reduced effectiveness. Consult a healthcare professional regarding potential drug interactions before taking telithromycin if you are on other medications.
* **Warnings:** Telithromycin can prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of serious heart rhythm problems.  It can also cause severe liver damage, including acute hepatic failure and death.  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment require careful dosage adjustment.  The medication should be used cautiously in pregnant or breastfeeding women because the effects are not fully known.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking telithromycin?** A:  It is best to avoid alcohol while taking telithromycin as it can potentially exacerbate side effects.
* **Q: How should I store telithromycin?** A: Store telithromycin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of the reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q:  Can I take telithromycin with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, that you're currently taking to assess potential interactions.  Telithromycin has significant interactions with many drugs.
* **Q:  Is telithromycin safe for pregnant women?** A: Telithromycin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking this medication during pregnancy.
