# Tazobactam/ Ceftolozane
### Generic Name
Tazobactam/Ceftolozane

### Usage

Tazobactam/Ceftolozane is a combination antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections.  It's primarily indicated for complicated intra-abdominal infections (those involving the abdomen's organs) and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including pyelonephritis (kidney infection).  This combination is particularly useful against Gram-negative bacteria that have developed resistance to other antibiotics.  The drug is not typically used to treat other types of infections.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage is administered intravenously (IV).

* **Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections:** 1.5 g (0.5 g tazobactam + 1 g ceftolozane) every 8 hours for 4-14 days. This is usually given in combination with metronidazole to cover a broader range of bacteria.
* **Complicated Urinary Tract Infections:** 1.5 g (0.5 g tazobactam + 1 g ceftolozane) every 8 hours for 7 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).  Refer to the prescribing information for specific adjustments based on CrCl levels.  Dosage modifications are also needed for patients on hemodialysis.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with liver impairment; however, caution is advised.
* **Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Tazobactam/Ceftolozane have not been established in children.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects (>10%):** Fever, headache, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and low potassium levels (hypokalemia).
* **Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):** Dizziness, anxiety, abdominal pain, increased liver enzymes (ALT & AST), anemia, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low blood pressure (hypotension), atrial fibrillation, and rash.
* **Rare Side Effects (<1%):**  A range of less frequent side effects including tachycardia, angina, stroke, blood clots, shortness of breath, dyspepsia, gastritis, bowel issues, high blood sugar, low magnesium/phosphate, increased liver enzyme levels, positive Coombs' test, kidney problems, infections, and allergic reactions.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that break down beta-lactam antibiotics (like ceftolozane), rendering them ineffective.  Tazobactam protects ceftolozane from this breakdown, allowing ceftolozane to work effectively.

Ceftolozane is a fifth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.  It works by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacterial cell walls. This inhibits the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  The disruption of cell wall synthesis leads to bacterial cell death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tazobactam/Ceftolozane is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tazobactam, ceftolozane, or other beta-lactam antibiotics.  Cross-allergenicity exists between different beta-lactam antibiotics.
* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** There is a risk of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Close monitoring is essential, especially after the first dose.
* **Pseudomembranous Colitis:** This serious bowel condition can occur with antibiotic use.  Watch for symptoms like severe diarrhea.
* **Superinfections:**  Antibiotic use can increase the risk of other infections (bacterial or fungal) due to the disruption of normal bacterial flora.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with probenecid can affect the levels of Tazobactam in the blood and is generally avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Tazobactam/Ceftolozane is categorized as pregnancy category B.  The drug's excretion into breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Tazobactam/Ceftolozane?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label. Generally, it should be stored at room temperature and protected from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Tazobactam/Ceftolozane when I feel better?** A: No.  It's crucial to complete the full prescribed course of treatment, even if you feel better, to prevent the risk of recurrence or the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Tazobactam/Ceftolozane?** A:  There aren't specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining adequate hydration is recommended.
