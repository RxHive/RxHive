# Thiethylperazine
### Generic Name
Thiethylperazine

### Usage
Thiethylperazine is primarily used to treat nausea and vomiting.  Its effectiveness is particularly noted in managing nausea and vomiting caused by several factors, including:

* **Anesthesia:**  Post-operative nausea and vomiting following surgery.
* **Cancer chemotherapy:**  Nausea and vomiting induced by certain cancer treatment medications (mildly emetic chemotherapy agents).
* **Radiation therapy:** Nausea and vomiting associated with radiation treatments.
* **Toxins:** Nausea and vomiting resulting from exposure to toxins.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage of thiethylperazine varies depending on the route of administration and the severity of symptoms.

* **Oral:** 10-30 mg one to three times daily.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** 10 mg one to three times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of thiethylperazine in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution should be exercised when using this medication in such patients.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fever
* Restlessness

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Convulsions (seizures)
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements, such as tremors, rigidity, and uncontrolled movements).


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly the more serious ones listed above,  consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Thiethylperazine is a dopamine antagonist. It works by blocking the effects of dopamine in the brain, specifically in areas responsible for triggering nausea and vomiting. This includes the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and the vomiting center. By blocking dopamine's action, it helps to reduce the signals that lead to nausea and vomiting.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Thiethylperazine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to thiethylperazine or any of its components.  Intravenous administration is also contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypotension (low blood pressure).
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of allergic reactions and potentiation (increased effect) of other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (like alcohol, sedatives, or opioids) when using thiethylperazine.
* **Caution:** Thiethylperazine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with bone marrow suppression (low blood cell counts). The potential benefits must outweigh the risks in these cases.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Thiethylperazine is contraindicated during pregnancy, and its excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, its use is not recommended during breastfeeding.

### FAQs
