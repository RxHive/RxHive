# Thioridazine
### Generic Name
Thioridazine

### Usage
Thioridazine is primarily used to treat schizophrenia in patients who haven't responded well to other antipsychotic medications.  It's reserved for cases where other treatments have proven ineffective or caused intolerable side effects.  While not its primary indication, thioridazine has also been used in the past for certain dementia-related disorders and depressive conditions, though its use in these areas is less common now due to safety concerns and the availability of newer, safer alternatives.  It's important to note that current guidelines generally discourage its use in these contexts.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia:** The initial dose is typically 50-100 mg three times a day (TID). This can be gradually increased, depending on the patient's response and tolerance, to a usual daily dose of 300-800 mg, divided into 2-4 doses.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 800 mg.
* **Dementia/Depressive Disorders (Use is discouraged due to safety concerns):**  If used in these contexts (which is not routinely recommended), the initial dose might be 25 mg TID, with the maintenance dose ranging from 20-200 mg/day.


**Children:**

Dosage for children under 2 years old is not established.  For children aged 2-12 years,  dosage depends on the specific condition and the child's weight.  A physician will carefully determine the appropriate dose.  For example, in schizophrenia, the initial dose might be 0.5 mg/kg daily, divided into 2-3 doses, with gradual increases up to a maximum of 3 mg/kg/day.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with these conditions, and close monitoring is crucial.

### Side Effects

Thioridazine can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially more serious.  It is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any concerning side effects develop.

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Prolonged QT interval (on ECG), torsades de pointes (a type of dangerous heart rhythm), low white blood cell count (leukopenia),  neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS - a rare but life-threatening condition), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements that can be permanent),  pigmentation changes in the skin, retinitis pigmentosa (a serious eye condition).


### How it Works
Thioridazine is an antipsychotic medication that works primarily by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes.  By blocking dopamine receptors, thioridazine reduces the excessive activity of dopamine associated with schizophrenia.  It also affects other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine, although the precise role of these interactions in its therapeutic effect isn't fully understood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Thioridazine is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to phenothiazines, coma, severe CNS depression, poorly controlled seizures, myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), severe cardiovascular disease,  and those concurrently taking drugs that prolong the QT interval. It is also contraindicated in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or a history of cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Drug Interactions:** Thioridazine can interact with numerous other medications, particularly CNS depressants (like alcohol, barbiturates, opioids), and drugs that prolong the QT interval.  Concomitant use with such drugs significantly increases the risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use in pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children requires careful consideration and monitoring due to potential risks.  Elderly patients are at increased risk of mortality when taking antipsychotics; therefore, thioridazine is generally avoided in this population.
* **Boxed Warnings:**  Thioridazine carries boxed warnings regarding its proarrhythmic potential (ability to cause dangerous heart rhythm disturbances), and the increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking thioridazine suddenly?** A: No,  stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while on thioridazine?** A: No, alcohol can enhance the sedative effects and increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: How should I store thioridazine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from light and moisture, and out of the reach of children.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Never take a double dose.
* **Q: Is thioridazine safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use can increase the risk of certain side effects, particularly tardive dyskinesia. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is vital.  The decision to continue long-term use should be made in consultation with your doctor, who will carefully weigh the benefits and risks.
