# Thioridazine

**Generic Name:** Thioridazine

**Usage:** Thioridazine is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It may also be used to treat certain symptoms of bipolar disorder, though its use in this context is less common now due to the availability of newer and safer medications.  It's important to note that thioridazine is generally considered a second-line or third-line treatment option due to its potential for serious side effects.

**Side Effects:** Thioridazine can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, and tremors.
* **Serious side effects:**  These are relatively rare but can be life-threatening.  They include:
    * **QT prolongation:** This is a lengthening of the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), which can lead to potentially fatal heart rhythm disturbances (torsades de pointes). This is a major concern and a significant reason for its decreased use.
    * **Retinitis pigmentosa:**  A degenerative eye disease that can lead to vision loss.  Regular eye exams are crucial if taking thioridazine.
    * **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but potentially fatal reaction characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
    * **Tardive dyskinesia (TD):** A serious movement disorder characterized by involuntary repetitive movements, particularly of the face, mouth, and tongue.  The risk of TD increases with longer duration of treatment.
    * **Low blood pressure (hypotension):**  Can cause dizziness and fainting, particularly when standing up quickly.
    * **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight.


**How it Works:** Thioridazine is a phenothiazine derivative that blocks dopamine receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes. By blocking dopamine receptors, thioridazine helps to reduce the symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions.  It also has some effects on other neurotransmitters, contributing to its sedative and anticholinergic properties.

**FAQs:**

* **Is thioridazine addictive?**  Physical dependence is unlikely, but psychological dependence can occur.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking thioridazine?**  No, alcohol can worsen the side effects of thioridazine, especially drowsiness and dizziness.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of thioridazine can take several weeks to become fully apparent.
* **Can thioridazine be taken with other medications?**  Thioridazine can interact with many other medications, including some antidepressants, antihistamines, and other antipsychotics.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Why is thioridazine less commonly prescribed now?** Due to its significant risk of serious side effects, particularly QT prolongation, newer antipsychotics with improved safety profiles are generally preferred.
