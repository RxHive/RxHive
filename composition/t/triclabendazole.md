# Triclabendazole
### Generic Name
Triclabendazole

### Usage
Triclabendazole is primarily used to treat fascioliasis, a parasitic liver infection caused by the liver flukes *Fasciola hepatica* and *Fasciola gigantica*.  It's effective against both immature and mature stages of these flukes.  Currently, there are no other significant or widely-accepted secondary uses for this medication.

### Dosage

**Fascioliasis:**

* **Adults:** The recommended oral dose is 10 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours for a total of two doses.  If precise dosage adjustment is difficult, always round upwards to the nearest whole or half tablet.
* **Children (â‰¥6 years):**  The dosage is the same as for adults. However, safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 6 years of age.

**Dosage Forms:** Triclabendazole is typically available as tablets. Some formulations may be scored to allow for easier division to adjust dosing.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding tablet division.

**Administration:**  Triclabendazole tablets can be swallowed whole or crushed and mixed with food.  Taking it with food increases absorption significantly.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult your doctor if you have concerns about your kidney or liver function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Nausea
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Urticaria (hives)

**Less Common Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Pruritus (itching)
* Musculoskeletal chest wall pain
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (serum bilirubin, AST, ALP, and ALT)

**Less Frequent Side Effects:** Increased liver enzymes can occur but the exact frequency is not defined in available data.

**Serious Side Effects:** While rare, QTc interval prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality) and hepatic toxicity (liver damage) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as chest pain, palpitations, or jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes).

### How it Works

Triclabendazole is an anthelmintic, meaning it's effective against parasitic worms. It acts by disrupting the metabolism and function of *Fasciola* liver flukes.  Specifically, it and its active metabolites (sulfoxide and sulfone) are absorbed by the parasite's outer layer (tegument), leading to a decrease in membrane potential, inhibition of tubulin function, and impaired protein and enzyme synthesis. These effects cause the parasite's motility to decrease, its structure to break down, and ultimately lead to its death.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Triclabendazole is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to triclabendazole, other benzimidazole derivatives, or any components of the formulation.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of QTc interval prolongation and hepatic toxicity with triclabendazole use. It should be used with caution in patients with a history of, or suspected, QTc prolongation and when used concurrently with other medications known to prolong the QTc interval.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of triclabendazole during pregnancy is unknown.  Excretion in breast milk is also unclear. The benefits and risks of breastfeeding while taking this medication should be carefully considered.

**Other Precautions:**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.  This is especially important for medications known to prolong the QTc interval.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I crush Triclabendazole tablets?**
A: Yes, triclabendazole tablets can be crushed and administered with food.  However, always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.

**Q: How should I store Triclabendazole?**
A: Store Triclabendazole tablets as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance if you miss a dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects of Triclabendazole?**
A: Long-term effects are generally not well-documented, but liver function should be monitored as hepatic toxicity is a potential risk.  Regular check-ups with your doctor are recommended during and after treatment.
