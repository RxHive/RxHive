# Trimetazidine
### Generic Name
Trimetazidine

### Usage
Trimetazidine is primarily used as an add-on treatment for chronic stable angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart). It's prescribed when initial angina treatments haven't been effective enough or aren't tolerated well by the patient.  It's crucial to understand that trimetazidine is *not* for treating acute angina attacks or as a first-line treatment for conditions like acute coronary syndrome.  Its role is to improve the heart's energy metabolism, thus reducing the likelihood of angina symptoms.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the formulation:

* **Immediate-release tablets:** Typically, 20 mg three times a day (TID).
* **Modified-release tablets:** Usually, 35 mg twice a day (BID).
* **Solution:**  Commonly, 3 mL (60 drops) three times a day (TID).

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with kidney problems (renal impairment).  For those with creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 60 and 30 mL/min, the dose might be reduced. Trimetazidine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).  Consult a healthcare professional for precise dosage instructions based on individual health status.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of trimetazidine in children haven't been established, so it's not recommended for pediatric use.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Weakness
* Rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Hives (urticaria)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (a rare skin reaction)
* Agranulocytosis (a severe decrease in white blood cells)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Parkinsonian symptoms (tremor, rigidity, slow movement)
* Restless legs syndrome
* Movement disorders
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Insomnia
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Thrombocytopenic purpura (a bleeding disorder)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly the less common ones listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Trimetazidine works by inhibiting the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the heart. This means it reduces the heart's reliance on fatty acids for energy production and shifts it towards using glucose instead.  Glucose metabolism requires less oxygen than fatty acid metabolism. By altering this energy pathway, trimetazidine helps to maintain sufficient energy supply to the heart muscle even when oxygen levels are low (such as during angina episodes), thus lessening chest pain.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Trimetazidine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, Parkinson's disease, parkinsonian symptoms, tremors, restless legs syndrome, or other movement disorders, and those with severe kidney impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with bromopride or metoclopramide should be avoided due to potential for increased adverse effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of trimetazidine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown. It's generally advised to avoid its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Use caution in elderly patients due to increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Conduction Disturbances:** Use with caution in patients with conduction disturbances.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take trimetazidine with other medications?** A: Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store trimetazidine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I stop taking trimetazidine suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking trimetazidine abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping suddenly could lead to worsening angina symptoms.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is trimetazidine addictive?** A: No, trimetazidine is not considered an addictive medication.
* **Q: Will trimetazidine cure my angina?** A: No, trimetazidine manages angina symptoms and improves energy metabolism in the heart, but it doesn't cure the underlying condition.  Lifestyle changes and other heart-healthy practices remain essential.
