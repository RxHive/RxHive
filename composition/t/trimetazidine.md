# Trimetazidine

**Generic Name:** Trimetazidine

**Usage:**

Trimetazidine is primarily used to treat angina pectoris (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart).  It's typically prescribed for patients who don't get adequate relief from other angina medications or who experience side effects from those medications.  It's often used as an *add-on* therapy, meaning it's taken in conjunction with other heart medications.  It is *not* a first-line treatment for angina.

**Side Effects:**

Trimetazidine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These are usually mild and include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, vertigo, insomnia, tremor, fatigue
* **Cardiovascular:** Palpitations
* **Other:**  Rarely, skin reactions.

Serious side effects are uncommon.  However,  if you experience severe or persistent side effects, you should contact your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Trimetazidine is a metabolic modulator. Unlike nitrates or beta-blockers (other common angina treatments), it doesn't directly affect blood vessels. Instead, it works by inhibiting the enzyme long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, which is involved in fatty acid oxidation in the heart.  By inhibiting this enzyme, trimetazidine shifts the heart's energy production from fatty acids to glucose. This helps maintain energy production in the heart muscle even when blood flow is reduced, thus reducing angina symptoms.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Trimetazidine a blood thinner?** No, it does not affect blood clotting.
* **Can I take Trimetazidine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking before starting trimetazidine.  Interactions with some medications are possible.
* **How long does it take to work?** The therapeutic effect of trimetazidine usually takes several weeks to become fully apparent.
* **Can I stop taking Trimetazidine suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking trimetazidine suddenly.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms or worsening angina.
* **Is Trimetazidine suitable for everyone with angina?** No, it's not appropriate for all patients with angina. Your doctor will assess your individual condition and medical history to determine if trimetazidine is a suitable treatment for you.
* **What are the contraindications?**  Known hypersensitivity to trimetazidine or any of its components.  Use with caution in patients with severe kidney or liver impairment.
