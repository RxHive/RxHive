# Triamterene
### Generic Name
Triamterene

### Usage
Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic primarily used to treat edema (swelling caused by fluid retention).  This edema can be associated with various conditions, including congestive heart failure (a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood), cirrhosis of the liver (scarring of the liver), and nephrotic syndrome (kidney damage causing protein loss in urine). It's also employed in managing steroid-induced edema (swelling caused by steroid medication), idiopathic edema (swelling of unknown cause), and edema resulting from secondary hyperaldosteronism (a hormonal imbalance). While not its primary use, Triamterene can sometimes be used in combination with other medications to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), although it has a minimal effect as a monotherapy for hypertension.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Edema:** The usual starting dose is 100 mg twice daily (BID).  The dosage may be adjusted based on individual response, but the maximum daily dose is 300 mg.

* **Hypertension (off-label use):**  50-100 mg per day, divided into one or two doses.  It's typically used in combination with thiazide diuretics to help prevent potassium loss (hypokalemia) which is a potential side effect of thiazides.

**Pediatric Dosage (off-label use):**

Dosage for children and adolescents is determined based on weight and should be determined by a doctor.  There isn't a standardized pediatric dosage, and its use in children should only occur under strict medical supervision.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Triamterene is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. For those with mild to moderate impairment, dosage adjustment isn't specifically outlined in standard guidelines, but caution is advised, and dose reduction may be considered in individuals with cirrhosis.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Triamterene is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, progressive kidney disease, or anuria (absence of urine production).  For patients with mild to moderate impairment, there are no specific dosage adjustments detailed in manufacturer's labeling, but use is generally avoided in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than or equal to 50 mL/min.  In adults 65 years or older with CrCl <30 mL/min, use should be avoided due to an increased risk of hyperkalemia and hyponatremia.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Skin rash
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dry mouth

Less common but serious side effects can include:

* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood)
* Increased uric acid levels (leading to gout)
* Metabolic acidosis (a condition where the body's pH is too low)
* Azotemia (increased nitrogenous compounds in the blood)
* Megaloblastic anemia (a type of anemia)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
* Abnormal liver enzyme levels
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Weakness
* Acute interstitial nephritis (inflammation of the kidneys)
* Acute renal failure
* Increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic. This means it increases urine output while helping to conserve potassium, a crucial electrolyte.  It achieves this by directly interfering with the exchange of sodium and potassium in the kidneys' distal tubules, cortical collecting tubules, and collecting ducts.  Specifically, it inhibits sodium and potassium-ATPase, which impacts the reabsorption of sodium and, consequently, water, leading to increased urination.  It also impacts calcium and magnesium levels, decreasing calcium excretion and potentially increasing magnesium loss.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Triamterene is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, anuria, severe or progressive kidney disease (except possibly nephrosis), severe liver disease, hyperkalemia, or those concurrently using other potassium-sparing agents or potassium supplements.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Triamterene can interact with several other medications, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, other antihypertensives, potassium salts, NSAIDs, and cardiac glycosides.  These interactions can lead to increased risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension, or other adverse effects. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Triamterene is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established. It should generally be avoided unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Triamterene.
* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, severe hepatic dysfunction, or kidney stones.  Regular monitoring of serum potassium levels, renal function, and other relevant parameters is crucial during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Triamterene suddenly?** A: No, abrupt cessation can be harmful. Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Triamterene?** A:  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol consumption during treatment, as it may exacerbate potential side effects.
* **Q: How should I store Triamterene?** A: Store it according to the instructions on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q:  Is Triamterene safe for everyone?** A: No, it has contraindications and precautions, as detailed above.  Its suitability depends on an individual's medical history and other factors.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medication.
