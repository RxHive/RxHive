# Tosufloxacin
### Generic Name
Tosufloxacin

### Usage

Tosufloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in ophthalmic solutions (eye drops) for treating bacterial infections of the eye, such as blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid), dacryocystitis (inflammation of the tear duct), hordeolum (stye), conjunctivitis (pink eye), tarsadenitis (inflammation of the tarsal glands), and keratitis (inflammation of the cornea). It's also used prophylactically (to prevent infection) before certain eye surgeries.

Orally administered tosufloxacin is indicated for treating more systemic infections including nongonococcal urethritis (inflammation of the urethra not caused by gonorrhea), osteomyelitis (bone infection), and arthritis (joint infection) caused by susceptible bacteria.  It also has activity against typhoid and paratyphoid fevers.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the route of administration (oral or ophthalmic) and the specific infection being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.

**Ophthalmic Solution (Eye Drops) (0.3%):**

* **Adults and Children:** For bacterial eye infections, typically one drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily (TID) until the infection resolves.  The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor. For surgical prophylaxis, one drop five times daily for two days, starting two days before surgery.

**Oral Tablets (150mg):**

* **Nongonococcal Urethritis:** 150 mg three times daily (TID) for 14 days.
* **Osteomyelitis and Arthritis:** 150 mg three times daily (TID).  Higher doses (up to 600 mg daily) may be necessary in severe cases.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.
* **Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers:** 150 mg four times daily (QID) for 14 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Ophthalmic use in children and adolescents is similar to adult dosing, but increased dosages have not been studied.  Oral use in children requires specific guidance from a pediatrician due to limited data.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.  Always consult with your doctor before adjusting the dosage.

### How it Works

Tosufloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by interfering with bacterial DNA replication.  Specifically, it inhibits the action of two enzymes essential for DNA replication: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. By blocking these enzymes, tosufloxacin prevents bacteria from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Tosufloxacin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to tosufloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or any of the medication's components.
* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Disorders:** Use with caution in patients with existing CNS disorders, as tosufloxacin can affect the central nervous system.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease; dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency:** Tosufloxacin should be used cautiously in individuals with this genetic condition, as it can cause hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of tosufloxacin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tosufloxacin can interact with other medications, including insulin, oral hypoglycemics, and antacids.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Contact Lenses:**  If using the ophthalmic solution, remove contact lenses before instilling the eye drops.
