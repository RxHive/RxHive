# Trimethobenzamide
### Generic Name
Trimethobenzamide

### Usage
Trimethobenzamide is primarily used as an antiemetic, meaning it helps to prevent or relieve nausea and vomiting.  Its main application is in adults experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It's also used to treat nausea associated with gastroenteritis (stomach flu).  It's important to note that its use in children is generally not recommended due to potential risks.


### Dosage
**Adults:**

* **Oral:** The typical dose is 300 mg three or four times daily.
* **Intramuscular (IM):**  The typical dose is 200 mg three or four times daily.  This route is for injection only; intravenous administration is not recommended.  The injection should be administered deep into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle.

**Children and Adolescents:** Trimethobenzamide is generally not recommended for children due to the risk of serious side effects affecting the central nervous system (CNS).  However, in specific cases of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, the following may be considered under strict medical supervision:

* **Oral:** Children weighing less than 15 kg (approximately 33 lbs): 100 mg every 6 hours as needed.  Children weighing 15 kg or more: 200 mg every 6 hours as needed.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 70 mL/minute/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is needed.  If CrCl is 70 mL/minute/1.73 m² or less, the dose should be reduced, the dosing interval increased, or both, depending on the patient's response. Close monitoring of renal function is essential.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include: dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and sedation.

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:  hypotension (with intravenous administration only), Parkinson-like symptoms, opisthotonos (backward arching of the body), hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, allergic skin reactions), injection site irritation, disorientation, coma, convulsions, mood depression, blurred vision, blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), jaundice, diarrhea, and muscle cramps.

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Trimethobenzamide works centrally in the brain, specifically targeting the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the medulla. The CTZ is involved in initiating the vomiting reflex.  By blocking emetic (vomiting-inducing) impulses from the CTZ to the vomiting center in the brain, trimethobenzamide helps prevent or relieve nausea and vomiting.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Trimethobenzamide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the medication or any of its components.  Intramuscular injection is also contraindicated in pediatric patients.
* **Increased Risks:** There's an increased risk of CNS effects, acute dystonic reactions (muscle spasms), other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), masking of other serious disorders, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), and allergic-type skin reactions.  Use should be approached with caution in patients with renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Trimethobenzamide can interact with various medications, including other CNS depressants, anticholinergic drugs, and certain analgesics.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of trimethobenzamide during pregnancy is not established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, and its use should be avoided during breastfeeding.
* **General Considerations:** For intramuscular administration, inject deep into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle. Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while using this medication. Do not operate machinery or drive until you know how it affects your alertness.
