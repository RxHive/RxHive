# Tolvaptan

**Generic Name:** Tolvaptan

**Usage:** Tolvaptan is used to treat hyponatremia, a condition in which there is an abnormally low level of sodium in the blood.  Specifically, it's used to treat patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.  It is *not* used for hypovolemic hyponatremia (low sodium due to dehydration).  The medication is typically used in hospitalized patients under close medical supervision due to the risk of serious side effects.

**Side Effects:** Tolvaptan can cause a number of side effects, some of which can be serious. These include:

* **Increased thirst:** This is a very common side effect.
* **Increased urination (polyuria):**  This can lead to dehydration if not carefully managed.
* **Dry mouth:**  Another common consequence of increased urination.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be mild to moderate.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:**  Can occur in some patients.
* **Muscle cramps:**  Less common but possible.
* **Liver problems (hepatotoxicity):** This is a serious potential side effect, requiring regular liver function tests.  Symptoms might include jaundice, dark urine, and abdominal pain.  The medication may need to be stopped if liver problems develop.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  Especially in patients already at risk for hypertension.
* **Severe dehydration:**  A serious complication of excessive urination.
* **Kidney problems:** Can worsen existing kidney issues.


**How it Works:** Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin receptor antagonist (V2 receptor antagonist).  Vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) is a hormone that regulates water balance in the body.  In hyponatremia, the body retains too much water. Tolvaptan blocks the action of vasopressin at the V2 receptors in the kidneys, preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing too much water. This helps to increase sodium concentration in the blood, correcting the hyponatremia.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is tolvaptan administered?**  A: Tolvaptan is typically administered orally as a tablet.  Dosage is determined by a physician based on the patient's condition and response to treatment.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effect of tolvaptan on sodium levels varies depending on the individual and the severity of hyponatremia.  It may take several hours or days to see a noticeable effect.

* **Q: What are the risks of taking tolvaptan?** A:  The most significant risks are dehydration, liver damage, and increased blood pressure.  Close monitoring is crucial, especially of fluid balance and liver function.

* **Q: Who shouldn't take tolvaptan?** A:  Tolvaptan should not be taken by patients with severe liver disease, severe dehydration, or certain types of hyponatremia (hypovolemic).  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss its use with their doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  If you experience any serious side effects, such as severe thirst, excessive urination, dizziness, or signs of liver problems, contact your doctor immediately.
