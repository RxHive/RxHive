It's crucial to understand that combining these ingredients without medical supervision is risky.  This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  **Do not attempt to self-treat with this combination.**  Always consult a doctor or qualified healthcare professional before starting any new treatment.

**Generic Name:**  There isn't a single generic name for this combination as it's not a standardized, FDA-approved formulation.  Each ingredient has its own generic name:

* Trypsin:  A proteolytic enzyme.
* Bromelain: A proteolytic enzyme derived from pineapple.
* Rutoside (Rutin): A bioflavonoid.
* Diclofenac: A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
* Papain: A proteolytic enzyme derived from papaya.


**Usage:**  This combination of ingredients is *not a standard medical treatment* and its proposed usage varies depending on who is recommending it.  Unsubstantiated claims often include reducing inflammation, swelling, pain, and improving tissue healing after injuries or surgery.  However, **there is limited scientific evidence supporting these claims for this specific combination.**


**Side Effects:**  The side effects of this combination would be a summation of the side effects of each individual ingredient.  These can be significant and include:

* **Trypsin/Bromelain/Papain:** Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  These enzymes can also affect blood clotting.
* **Diclofenac:** Stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, ulcers, bleeding, increased risk of heart attack and stroke, kidney problems, liver problems, allergic reactions.
* **Rutoside:** Generally considered safe, but potential side effects can include mild gastrointestinal upset.

**How it Works:** (Based on the individual components)

* **Trypsin, Bromelain, and Papain:** These are proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins.  The proposed mechanism in inflammation reduction is the breakdown of inflammatory proteins.  However, the effectiveness in this context requires further clinical research, especially within the context of the combined preparation.
* **Diclofenac:** This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain.
* **Rutoside:**  Acts as an antioxidant and may help strengthen capillary walls, potentially reducing swelling.
