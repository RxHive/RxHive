# Tazemetostat
### Generic Name
Tazemetostat

### Usage
Tazemetostat is a medication used to treat adults and adolescents 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma.  This means it's used for cases where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body or is locally advanced and cannot be completely surgically removed.  It's currently approved specifically for this type of sarcoma and does not have widespread applications for other cancers.


### Dosage

**Epithelioid Sarcoma (Metastatic or Locally Advanced):**

* **Adults and Adolescents â‰¥16 years:** The usual starting dose is 800 mg twice daily (BID) orally, until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects develop.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on side effects (see below).

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific guidance for moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  Close monitoring is crucial in these cases.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically required for patients with renal impairment.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reductions are recommended based on the severity of side effects, specifically hematological issues like neutropenia (low neutrophil count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), anemia, and other adverse reactions.  The medication may need to be temporarily withheld or permanently discontinued depending on the severity and recurrence of these side effects.  Specific guidelines for dose reduction based on toxicity levels are provided by the prescribing physician.

### How it Works

Tazemetostat is a type of medicine called an EZH2 inhibitor.  It works by blocking the activity of the EZH2 enzyme, which plays a role in the growth and spread of certain cancer cells, including those found in epithelioid sarcoma.  EZH2 is part of a complex that controls gene expression, and by inhibiting it, Tazemetostat helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.  It also targets EZH1 and some EZH2 gain-of-function mutations.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Tazemetostat may cause harm to a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for 6 months afterward. Men with female partners of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months afterward.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown if Tazemetostat passes into breast milk.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers or inhibitors.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Tazemetostat can suppress bone marrow function, increasing the risk of anemia, low white blood cell counts, and low platelet counts. Regular blood tests are needed to monitor for these effects.
* **Secondary Malignancies:** There's a potential risk of developing secondary malignancies (new cancers) with Tazemetostat use.
* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring is required for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, as specific dose adjustments may not be available.
