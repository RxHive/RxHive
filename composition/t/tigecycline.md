# Tigecycline
### Generic Name
Tigecycline

### Usage
Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat several serious bacterial infections.  Its primary uses are:

* **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP):**  This is a lung infection acquired outside of a hospital setting.  Tigecycline is an option when other antibiotics aren't suitable or have failed.
* **Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI):** These are infections involving the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and sometimes deeper structures, often requiring hospitalization.
* **Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI):**  These are infections within the abdominal cavity, usually following surgery or injury. They can be severe and life-threatening.

While tigecycline has broad-spectrum activity, it's crucial to understand that it's typically reserved for severe infections where other antibiotics are ineffective or contraindicated due to potential side effects and increased mortality risk seen in some studies.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional. The information below is for general understanding only and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:** Tigecycline is administered intravenously (IV).

* **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP):**  A 100 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 7-14 days.
* **Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI):** A 100 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5-14 days.

The infusion should be given over 30-60 minutes.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of tigecycline in children under 8 years old have not been fully established. Its use in this age group should only be considered when no other suitable antibiotics are available.  Dosage in older children (8-11 years and 12 years and older) is adjusted based on weight and is given intravenously under strict medical supervision.  Consult a pediatrician for specific pediatric dosing guidelines.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C).  Renal impairment generally doesn't require dosage adjustment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea

Other less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Chills
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Allergic reactions (including rare cases of anaphylaxis)
* <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (C. diff)
* Acute pancreatitis
* Changes in blood clotting parameters

It is crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Tigecycline is a glycylcycline antibiotic. It works by binding to the bacterial ribosome's 30S subunit, interfering with protein synthesis and ultimately preventing bacterial growth.  While generally bacteriostatic (slowing bacterial growth), it can exhibit bactericidal (killing bacteria) effects against some bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Tigecycline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to tigecycline, other tetracyclines, or any component of the formulation.
* **Liver Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with liver disease, as dosage adjustment may be needed.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Tigecycline is a pregnancy category D drug, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus.  It's generally avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tigecycline due to the potential for tooth discoloration and bone growth inhibition in the infant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tigecycline may interact with several other medications. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Increased Mortality Risk:**  Studies have shown an increased risk of mortality associated with tigecycline use compared to some other antibiotics. This should be carefully considered by healthcare professionals when making treatment decisions.
* **Superinfections:** As with other antibiotics, tigecycline can lead to the overgrowth of other bacteria or fungi, causing secondary infections.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Tigecycline with antacids?** A: No, antacids can reduce tigecycline's absorption.  Consult your doctor about appropriate timing of medication administration.

* **Q: How should I store Tigecycline?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist. Usually, it involves refrigeration.

* **Q: Is Tigecycline safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use is generally not recommended due to the potential for serious side effects and increased mortality risk.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration of treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while on Tigecycline?** A: It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol consumption while taking Tigecycline.
