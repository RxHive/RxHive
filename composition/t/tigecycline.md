# Tigecycline

**Generic Name:** Tigecycline

**Usage:** Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections that are resistant to other antibiotics.  It's typically reserved for infections that are life-threatening or have failed other treatments.  Specific uses include:

* Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI)
* Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)
* Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP)


**Side Effects:**  Like all antibiotics, tigecycline can cause side effects.  Some are common, while others are rare but serious.  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue

More serious, though less common, side effects can include:

* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):**  This can range from mild to life-threatening.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  Liver function tests should be monitored.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Including allergic reactions ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis.
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  Leading to decreased blood cell counts.
* **Esophageal ulcers:**  Increased risk with administration via the IV route.  Always administer with sufficient fluid.
* **Tooth discoloration (in children):**  This is a long term, significant side effect if used in young developing children.


**How it Works:** Tigecycline is a glycylcycline antibiotic. It works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, inhibiting protein synthesis and thus preventing bacterial growth and replication.  Its broad-spectrum activity is due to its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosome even in the presence of mutations that confer resistance to tetracyclines (a related class of antibiotics).


**FAQs:**

* **Is tigecycline a first-line treatment?** No. Due to potential side effects and the availability of other antibiotics, tigecycline is generally reserved for serious infections that are resistant to other treatments.
* **Can I take tigecycline with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbs, and supplements, as interactions can occur.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately, especially if you experience severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, signs of liver damage (jaundice, dark urine), or allergic reactions.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking tigecycline?**  Alcohol can exacerbate some side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting.  It's best to avoid alcohol while on this medication.
* **How long will I need to take tigecycline?**  The duration of treatment depends on the severity and type of infection and will be determined by your doctor.
* **Can I stop taking tigecycline early if I feel better?** No.  Stopping treatment early can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and a relapse of the infection.  Always complete the full course of treatment as prescribed.
