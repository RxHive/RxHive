# Tafluprost
### Generic Name
Tafluprost

### Usage
Tafluprost is primarily used as an ophthalmic (eye) solution to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  These conditions involve increased pressure within the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.  Tafluprost helps to reduce this pressure, thereby protecting vision.


### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical dosage for adults with elevated IOP is one drop of 0.0015% Tafluprost ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.  It's crucial not to exceed this dosage, as more frequent application may actually reduce the effectiveness of the medication in lowering IOP. The reduction in IOP typically begins 2-4 hours after the first dose, reaching its maximum effect around 12 hours later.

**Children:** Tafluprost is not recommended for use in children due to the potential for increased iris pigmentation (darkening of the colored part of the eye) with long-term use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the white part of the eye)

**Less Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Eye irritation
* Stinging of the eyes
* Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva)
* Cataract formation (clouding of the eye's lens)
* Eye pain
* Dry eyes (xerophthalmia)
* Blurred vision
* Hyperpigmentation of eyelashes (darkening of eyelashes)
* Increased eyelash length
* Headache
* Urinary tract infection
* Common cold
* Cough

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (affecting less than 1% of patients):**

* Iritis/uveitis (inflammation of the iris and uvea, the middle layer of the eye)
* Exacerbation of asthma (worsening of asthma symptoms)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Periorbital and lid changes, including deepening of the eyelid sulcus (the groove between the eyelid and cheek)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as rare but serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Tafluprost is a prostaglandin analog, meaning it's similar to naturally occurring substances in the body called prostaglandins.  The active form of Tafluprost (Tafluprost acid) works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, the fluid that fills the front part of the eye. This increased outflow reduces the pressure within the eye.  While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, it is believed to primarily act on the uveoscleral pathway, a route for fluid drainage from the eye.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Tafluprost is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Tafluprost or its components.

**Increased Risk:**  Use of Tafluprost increases the risk of changes to the eyelids and eyelashes, including darkening, and pigmentation of the iris (the colored part of the eye).

**Use with Caution:** Tafluprost should be used cautiously in the following groups:

* Patients with aphakia (absence of the eye's lens)
* Patients with pseudophakia (presence of an artificial lens) and a torn posterior lens capsule
* Patients with known risk factors for macular edema (swelling of the macula, the central part of the retina)
* Pregnant or breastfeeding women
* Patients with ocular inflammation


**Drug Interactions:**  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may interact with Tafluprost.  It's important to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Tafluprost?** A: Store Tafluprost at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: Can I use Tafluprost if I wear contact lenses?** A: It's best to remove contact lenses before applying Tafluprost and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is Tafluprost safe for long-term use?** A:  While generally safe for long-term use, regular monitoring by your ophthalmologist is essential, especially to check for iris pigmentation changes.

* **Q:  What if I accidentally get Tafluprost in my other eye?** A: This is unlikely to cause harm, but it's best to avoid getting it in the unaffected eye.
