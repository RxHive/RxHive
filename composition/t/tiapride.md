# Tiapride
### Generic Name
Tiapride

### Usage

Tiapride is primarily used to manage agitation and aggression, particularly in elderly individuals with chronic alcoholism.  It's also indicated for treating chorea and tics associated with Tourette syndrome and severe behavioral disorders characterized by aggression and agitation.  In certain cases, it may be used to manage severe, treatment-resistant pain syndromes.  While not its primary use, Tiapride has shown some efficacy in these other conditions.  It is important to remember that Tiapride is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  Here is some general guidance, but this should not substitute for a doctor's prescription:

**Adults:**

* **Agitation and Aggression (Oral):** Initial dose is typically 200-300 mg/day for 1-2 months.  Elderly patients may start with a lower dose (50 mg twice daily) and gradually increase it under close medical supervision.  The maximum daily dose is usually 300 mg.
* **Chorea in Tourette Syndrome (Oral):** The starting dose is lower (25 mg/day), gradually increasing until the minimum effective dose is reached (generally 300-800 mg/day).
* **Chronic Pain Syndrome (Oral):** Initial dose is usually 200-400 mg/day.
* **Intensive Chronic Pain (IV/IM):** 200-400 mg (2-4 ampoules) per day, with a maximum daily dose of 300 mg.

**Children (Over 6 years old):**

Dosage for children is determined based on weight and condition and is significantly lower than adult dosages.  It's crucial to strictly adhere to the doctor's prescribed dosage.  Examples include:

* **Behavioral Disorders with Agitation and Aggression (Oral):** 100-150 mg/day.
* **Chorea in Tourette Syndrome (IV):** 3-6 mg/kg per day.
* **Intensive Chronic Pain (IV/IM):** 100-150 mg/day, with a maximum of 300 mg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Renal impairment requires dose reduction.  Consult a doctor for specific adjustments based on creatinine clearance.  There is no specific dosage adjustment for hepatic impairment noted in manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Elevated prolactin levels (leading to breast pain, enlargement, milk production, menstrual irregularities)
* Agitation
* Apathy
* Insomnia
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders)
* Akathisia (restlessness)
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Drowsiness
* Weight gain

Less common, but serious side effects may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a life-threatening condition).  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Tiapride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of dopamine in specific brain regions associated with movement, mood, and behavior. By reducing dopamine activity, Tiapride can help alleviate symptoms of agitation, aggression, and movement disorders.  It's considered more selective than some other antipsychotics, targeting specific dopamine receptors rather than a broader range of receptors.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tiapride is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to it, those with prolactin-dependent tumors, pheochromocytoma, and those using levodopa or other dopaminergic medications.
* **Interactions:** Tiapride can interact with other central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines), potentiating their effects.  It may also interact with levodopa, anticholinergics, and other neuroleptics.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in elderly patients, those with cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression, myasthenia gravis, paralytic ileus, prostatic hypertrophy, and blood dyscrasias.  There is increased risk for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, QT interval prolongation, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mortality in elderly patients with dementia.  Use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Tiapride?** A:  Drowsiness and dizziness are potential side effects; avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if affected.
* **Q: How should I store Tiapride?** A: Store as directed on the prescription label, typically in a cool, dry place.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double the dose; take the next dose at the scheduled time.  Consult your doctor if you have concerns.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Tiapride suddenly?** A:  No, abruptly stopping can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always taper off under your doctor's supervision.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects are possible and may include tardive dyskinesia (a movement disorder).  Regular monitoring by your doctor is important.
