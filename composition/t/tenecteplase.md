# Tenecteplase
### Generic Name
Tenecteplase

### Usage
Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) primarily used to treat ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), also known as a heart attack caused by a blocked coronary artery.  It works by breaking down blood clots that are obstructing blood flow to the heart muscle. This helps restore blood flow and limits damage to the heart.

While its primary use is in STEMI, tenecteplase also sees off-label use in other conditions involving dangerous blood clots:

* **Acute Ischemic Stroke:** Tenecteplase is sometimes used to dissolve blood clots in the brain causing an ischemic stroke, particularly in patients also eligible for mechanical thrombectomy (a procedure to physically remove the clot).  It's crucial to note this is off-label use.

* **Acute Pulmonary Embolism:**  Tenecteplase may be considered in cases of acute pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung), particularly if the patient is hemodynamically unstable (showing signs of significant circulatory compromise) or has a massive embolism.  Again, this is considered off-label use and is typically reserved for select cases where the benefits outweigh the risks.


### Dosage
Tenecteplase dosage is weight-based and administered intravenously (IV) as a single bolus injection.  The exact dosage varies depending on the patient's weight and the specific condition being treated.  Precise administration guidelines must be followed by a trained medical professional.

**STEMI:**

* <60 kg: 30 mg
* 60-69 kg: 35 mg
* 70-79 kg: 40 mg
* 80-89 kg: 45 mg
* â‰¥90 kg: 50 mg

The injection should be given over 5 seconds.

**Acute Ischemic Stroke (Off-Label):**

* 0.25 mg/kg (maximum 25 mg) administered within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.


**Acute Pulmonary Embolism (Off-Label):**  Dosage is similar to STEMI (see above), administered over 5-10 seconds.  The decision to use tenecteplase in pulmonary embolism is highly case-specific and should only be considered in select situations by a physician.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of tenecteplase in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically made for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, although careful consideration is necessary in severe liver impairment due to increased bleeding risk.  


### Side Effects
Common side effects of tenecteplase are primarily related to its blood-thinning effect and include:

* Bleeding (at injection site, internally, or externally) - This is the most significant risk.
* Hematoma (blood clot under the skin)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Stroke
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Nausea and vomiting

It's crucial to contact a healthcare professional immediately if any adverse effects occur.


### How it Works
Tenecteplase is a modified form of alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator.  It works by binding to fibrin, a protein involved in blood clot formation.  This binding triggers the conversion of plasminogen (an inactive enzyme) to plasmin (an active enzyme that breaks down fibrin).  By activating plasmin, tenecteplase effectively dissolves the blood clot, restoring blood flow to the affected area (heart or brain).  Compared to alteplase, tenecteplase offers improved fibrin specificity and resistance to inhibitors, leading to a longer duration of action.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Tenecteplase is contraindicated in patients with a history of recent stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, active bleeding (excluding menstruation), suspected aortic dissection, or hypersensitivity to the medication.  Specific contraindications vary depending on the indication (STEMI vs. off-label uses).

* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with other anticoagulants (blood thinners) or antiplatelet agents (drugs that prevent blood clots) significantly increases the risk of bleeding. Careful monitoring is required if such medications are used concurrently.

* **Specific Populations:**  Tenecteplase should be used cautiously in the elderly, pregnant women (Category C), and breastfeeding women.  The risk of bleeding is higher in these populations.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does tenecteplase take to work?** A: The effects of tenecteplase are usually seen relatively quickly, but the full therapeutic impact may take several hours.

* **Q: How is tenecteplase stored?** A: Tenecteplase should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically under refrigeration.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Tenecteplase is typically administered as a single dose; missing a dose isn't applicable.

* **Q:  Is tenecteplase safe?** A: Tenecteplase is generally safe when used appropriately under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  However, it carries a significant risk of bleeding, which necessitates careful patient selection and close monitoring.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving tenecteplase?** A:  This depends on the condition being treated and the individual's response to the medication.  A healthcare provider will advise on driving restrictions.
