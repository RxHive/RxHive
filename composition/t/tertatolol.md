# Tertatolol
### Generic Name
Tertatolol

### Usage
Tertatolol is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), specifically mild to moderate stages (Stages I and II).  It works by reducing the heart's workload and slowing the heart rate, thus lowering blood pressure.  While not its primary indication, it may be considered in other cardiovascular situations under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

**Adults:** For mild to moderate hypertension, the typical starting dose is 5 mg orally once daily (OD). This may be increased to 7.5-10 mg OD if needed, based on individual response and blood pressure monitoring.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with severe liver disease; they should receive 50% of the usual dose.  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for renal impairment.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Tertatolol in children have not been established; therefore, it is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Administration:** Tertatolol is usually administered orally as a tablet.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions regarding dosage and frequency.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain)
* Rash
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Angina pectoris (chest pain)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*  Intermittent claudication (pain in the legs during exercise)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Systemic lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease)
* Carpal tunnel syndrome


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones,  seek immediate medical attention.  Do not stop taking Tertatolol abruptly without consulting your doctor.


### How it Works

Tertatolol is a non-selective beta-blocker. This means it blocks the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline (catecholamines) at beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and other parts of the body.  By blocking these receptors, Tertatolol reduces the heart rate and the force of heart contractions, leading to a decrease in blood pressure and reduced cardiac workload. It lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and alpha-adrenoceptor affinity.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Tertatolol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and severe sinus bradycardia.

**Drug Interactions:** Tertatolol can interact with several medications, including:  digoxin and digitoxin (increased risk of digitalis toxicity), alpha-blockers (hypotension), other beta-blockers (bradycardia, hypotension, AV block), clonidine (increased risk of bradycardia, exaggerated withdrawal response), calcium channel blockers (hypotension, bradycardia, AV conduction disturbances), fingolimod (severe bradycardia and heart block), methacholine (exaggerated bronchoconstriction), methyldopa (hypertensive response, tachycardia, arrhythmias), and St. John's wort (decreased effectiveness).  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.

**Warnings:** Tertatolol should be used cautiously in patients with first-degree AV block, those undergoing anesthesia or surgery, those with bronchospastic disease, cerebrovascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hepatic disease, hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis, myasthenic conditions, peripheral vascular disease, and renal disease. It may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperthyroidism. It can worsen psoriasis and unmask myasthenia gravis.  Abrupt withdrawal should be avoided; gradual tapering over 1-2 weeks is recommended.  Pregnancy and lactation safety are not fully established.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I stop taking Tertatolol suddenly?**

A: No, abruptly stopping Tertatolol can lead to serious complications.  Always consult your doctor before discontinuing the medication; a gradual withdrawal schedule will be recommended.

**Q: How should I store Tertatolol?**

A: Store Tertatolol as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Tertatolol?**

A:  Alcohol can interact with Tertatolol and increase the risk of side effects, especially hypotension. It's best to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication. Consult your doctor for advice.
