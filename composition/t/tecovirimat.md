# Tecovirimat
### Generic Name
Tecovirimat

### Usage
Tecovirimat is an antiviral medication specifically used to treat smallpox disease caused by the variola virus.  It's currently the only FDA-approved treatment for smallpox. While its effectiveness in humans hasn't been definitively proven due to the lack of large-scale human trials (smallpox has been eradicated), its mechanism of action and preclinical data strongly support its use.


### Dosage

**Adults:** For smallpox, the recommended oral dose is 600 mg twice daily (BID) for 14 days.

**Children and Adolescents (Smallpox):**  Dosage is weight-based:

*   13 to <25 kg: 200 mg BID for 14 days
*   25 to <40 kg: 400 mg BID for 14 days
*   ≥40 kg: 600 mg BID for 14 days

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

**Administration:** Tecovirimat is administered orally. It should be taken within 30 minutes after a meal containing at least a moderate amount of fat (approximately 25 grams).  If a patient cannot swallow capsules whole, the contents can be mixed with approximately 30 mL of liquid (like milk, chocolate milk, or infant formula) or soft food (such as applesauce or yogurt), but the mixture should be consumed within 30 minutes of preparation.

**Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, particularly serious or persistent ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tecovirimat works by inhibiting the variola virus's VP37 protein.  This protein is crucial for the virus's ability to spread within the body. By blocking VP37's interaction with cellular components (Rab9 GTPase and TIP47), Tecovirimat prevents the formation of the viral envelope needed for the virus to leave infected cells and spread. This effectively limits the virus's replication and spread, helping to control the infection.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety and efficacy of Tecovirimat in pregnant women haven't been established.  Smallpox infection is more severe in pregnant individuals, and there's a risk of transmission to the fetus.  Whether the drug is excreted in breast milk is unknown. The decision to continue or discontinue breastfeeding during treatment should involve careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits for both mother and child.
* **Immunocompromised Patients:** Use with caution in individuals with weakened immune systems.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tecovirimat may interact with other medications.  Specifically, concomitant use with repaglinide (a diabetes medication) may increase repaglinide's levels and effects, while concomitant use with midazolam (a sedative) may decrease midazolam's levels and effects.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **No other contraindications are listed in the manufacturer’s labeling.**
