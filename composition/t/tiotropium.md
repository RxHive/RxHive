# Tiotropium

**Generic Name:** Tiotropium bromide

**Usage:**

Tiotropium bromide is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator used to prevent bronchospasm (constriction of the airways) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's also sometimes used for  bronchospasm associated with asthma, though this is less common than its use in COPD.  It is typically administered via inhalation using a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a nebulizer.  It's *not* used for the acute relief of bronchospasm; it's for maintenance therapy.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dry mouth: This is often the most frequently reported side effect.
* Constipation: Can range from mild to severe.
* Headache: Can be mild to moderate.
* Urinary retention: Difficulty urinating, particularly in men with an enlarged prostate.
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Cough
* Sinus infection

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Glaucoma: Increased eye pressure.  Patients with a history of glaucoma should use caution and consult their doctor.
* Allergic reactions:  Rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* Increased risk of pneumonia (particularly in older adults)
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)

**How it Works:**

Tiotropium bromide works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the muscles in the airways to constrict.  By blocking acetylcholine's effects, tiotropium helps to relax the muscles surrounding the airways, making it easier to breathe.  This effect is long-lasting, hence its use as a maintenance medication.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects of tiotropium are not immediate.  It usually takes several days or weeks to reach its full therapeutic effect.  It's a maintenance medication, not a rescue inhaler.

* **Q: Can I use tiotropium with other medications?** A: It's important to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies.  There are potential interactions with other medications, especially other anticholinergics.

* **Q: Can I stop taking tiotropium suddenly?** A: No.  You should always talk to your doctor before stopping or changing your dose of tiotropium.  Sudden cessation can worsen your condition.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q:  Is tiotropium safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  The safety of tiotropium during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Consult your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of tiotropium?** A: Long-term use may increase the risk of some side effects, especially glaucoma and pneumonia, though regular monitoring by a physician can help mitigate risks.
