# Terazosin

**Generic Name:** Terazosin

**Usage:**

Terazosin is primarily used to treat:

* **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH):**  This is an enlargement of the prostate gland that can cause urinary problems such as frequent urination, weak urine stream, and difficulty starting urination.  Terazosin relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow.
* **High blood pressure (hypertension):** Terazosin relaxes blood vessels, reducing blood pressure. It's often used in combination with other blood pressure medications.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is often most pronounced when starting treatment or increasing the dose.  It's advised to get up slowly from a lying or sitting position.
* **Lightheadedness:** Similar to dizziness, and can also be related to postural hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing).
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Drowsiness:**
* **Nasal congestion:** Stuffy nose.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Fainting (syncope):** Due to a sudden drop in blood pressure.
* **Fast heartbeat (tachycardia):**
* **Shortness of breath:**
* **Swelling in ankles, feet, or legs:**
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Priapism (persistent and painful erection):** This is a rare but serious side effect.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.

**How it Works:**

Terazosin is an alpha-blocker.  It works by relaxing the muscles in the blood vessels and prostate.  This relaxation:

* **Reduces blood pressure:** By widening blood vessels, reducing resistance to blood flow.
* **Improves urine flow:** By relaxing the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, easing the blockage and improving urination.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Terazosin?** A: Alcohol can worsen the dizziness and lightheadedness caused by Terazosin.  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects on blood pressure are usually noticed within a few days to weeks.  For BPH, improvement in urinary symptoms may take several weeks.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Terazosin suddenly?** A:  No, you should not stop taking Terazosin suddenly, especially if you're taking it for high blood pressure.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure. Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose.
* **Q:  What are the interactions with other medications?** A:  Terazosin can interact with other medications, including other blood pressure medications, certain antidepressants, and antifungals.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Q: Is Terazosin safe for everyone?** A: Terazosin may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with certain medical conditions like severe liver or kidney disease, or a history of fainting.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.
