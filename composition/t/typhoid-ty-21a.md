# Typhoid TY 21A
### Generic Name
Typhoid TY 21A

### Usage
Typhoid TY 21A is a vaccine used to prevent typhoid fever, a serious bacterial infection caused by *Salmonella Typhi*.  It's primarily used for individuals traveling to areas where typhoid fever is common, or those with an increased risk of exposure.  The vaccine helps the body build immunity against the bacteria, reducing the chances of developing the disease.

### Dosage

**Oral Administration (Capsules):**

* **Adults and Children ≥ 6 years:** The primary immunization course involves taking one capsule every other day for four doses (days 1, 3, 5, and 7).  All doses should be taken at least one week before potential exposure to typhoid bacteria.  Re-immunization, for those with continued or repeated exposure risk, is a repeat of the primary course every 5 years.  Capsules should be swallowed whole with a cold or lukewarm beverage (≤37°C/98.6°F), one hour before a meal. Avoid alcohol one hour before or two hours after taking the vaccine.

**Intramuscular (IM) Injection:**

* **Adults and Children ≥ 2 years:** The primary immunization dose is a single 0.5 mL injection into the deltoid muscle.  This should be given at least two weeks before potential exposure. Re-immunization is a 0.5 mL injection every two years.  The injection should be administered by a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Typhoid TY 21A is a live attenuated vaccine.  This means it uses a weakened form of the *Salmonella Typhi* bacteria.  When administered, the weakened bacteria stimulate the body's immune system to produce antibodies.  These antibodies provide protection against future infection by the actual typhoid bacteria.  The vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection without causing the illness.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Typhoid TY21A is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the vaccine components, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (for oral administration), acute febrile illness (oral), or acute gastrointestinal conditions or inflammatory bowel disease (oral).

* **Interactions:**  Concomitant use of antibiotics or immunoglobulins may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness. Mefloquine may increase its effectiveness. Immunosuppressants may increase adverse effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Typhoid TY21A is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established; use with caution and only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Consult a doctor before vaccination.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulant therapy should be carefully monitored following IM injection.  Individuals with existing gastrointestinal issues may experience increased side effects.  The vaccine is not a treatment for active typhoid fever; it's for prevention only.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A:  The duration of protection varies, but re-immunization is recommended every 5 years (oral) or every 2 years (IM) for sustained protection.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while receiving this vaccine?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects usually resolve on their own.  For severe or persistent effects, seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: Is this vaccine safe for children?** A:  The oral vaccine is generally safe for children ≥6 years, and the IM vaccine for those ≥2 years.  However, it's crucial to discuss vaccination with a healthcare professional to ensure suitability for each child.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with the vaccine packaging carefully.

* **Q:  Will this vaccine completely prevent typhoid fever?** A: While the vaccine significantly reduces the risk, it does not guarantee 100% protection.  Maintaining good hygiene practices remains essential.
