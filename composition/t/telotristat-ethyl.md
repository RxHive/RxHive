# Telotristat Ethyl
### Generic Name
Telotristat Ethyl

### Usage

Telotristat ethyl is primarily used to manage diarrhea associated with carcinoid syndrome in adults.  Carcinoid syndrome is a condition caused by tumors (usually in the gastrointestinal tract) that produce excessive amounts of hormones, including serotonin. This excess serotonin can lead to severe, persistent diarrhea, flushing, and other symptoms.  Telotristat ethyl is specifically indicated for patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by somatostatin analog therapy (another type of medication used to treat carcinoid syndrome). It's important to note that Telotristat ethyl is *not* a first-line treatment for carcinoid syndrome; it's used in conjunction with, and only when necessary to supplement, somatostatin analog therapy.

### Dosage

The typical adult dosage for carcinoid syndrome diarrhea is 250 mg three times daily (TID) orally. This should be taken with food.  If Telotristat ethyl is used in combination with short-acting octreotide (a somatostatin analog), the octreotide should be administered at least 30 minutes after the Telotristat ethyl dose.  

Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic impairment.  For those with mild impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no dose adjustment is necessary, but closer monitoring for adverse reactions is recommended.  Telotristat ethyl is not recommended for use in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C).  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild-to-severe renal impairment, including those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis; however, this lack of adjustment is based on manufacturer's labeling, not necessarily extensive clinical trial data.  

The safety and efficacy of Telotristat ethyl in pediatric patients have not been established.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

*   Headache
*   Nausea

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

*   Peripheral edema
*   Depression
*   Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (a liver enzyme)
*   Decreased appetite
*   Flatulence
*   Abdominal pain
*   Constipation
*   Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST)
*   Fever

**Serious Side Effects (though less frequent):**  Severe constipation or the development of severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain warrants immediate discontinuation of the medication and contact with a healthcare provider.

**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Telotristat ethyl and its active metabolite, telotristat, work by inhibiting the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase.  Tryptophan hydroxylase is crucial in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in various bodily functions. In patients with carcinoid syndrome, excessive serotonin is produced in the periphery, which contributes to the characteristic diarrhea. By inhibiting tryptophan hydroxylase, Telotristat ethyl reduces the production of peripheral serotonin, thereby lessening the severity of diarrhea.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Telotristat ethyl is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; it's contraindicated in those with moderate to severe impairment.
* **Gastrointestinal Toxicity:**  Closely monitor patients for the development of severe constipation or severe, persistent, or worsening abdominal pain.  Discontinue the medication if these symptoms occur.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Telotristat ethyl can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., midazolam). Concomitant use with octreotide may reduce the efficacy of Telotristat ethyl.  A healthcare professional should carefully consider potential drug interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety and efficacy of Telotristat ethyl in pregnant women have not been established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, and decisions regarding breastfeeding during therapy require careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits for both mother and infant.  If breastfeeding, the infant should be monitored for constipation.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Telotristat ethyl with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Telotristat ethyl can interact with other drugs, and your doctor will determine if it's safe to use them together.

* **Q: How should I store Telotristat ethyl?** A: Store Telotristat ethyl as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Telotristat ethyl suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking Telotristat ethyl without consulting your doctor first.  Stopping abruptly may worsen your condition.

* **Q: Is Telotristat ethyl safe for long-term use?** A: The long-term safety of Telotristat ethyl needs to be assessed based on individual patient response and clinical monitoring.  Discuss long-term use with your healthcare provider.
