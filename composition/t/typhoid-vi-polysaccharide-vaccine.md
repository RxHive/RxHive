# Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine
### Generic Name
Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine

### Usage
Typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine is used to actively immunize individuals aged 2 years and older against typhoid fever, a bacterial infection caused by *Salmonella Typhi*.  Its primary use is preventing typhoid in individuals traveling to regions where the disease is prevalent.  It's also used to protect individuals with ongoing or repeated exposure to *S. Typhi*.  This vaccine does *not* protect against other *Salmonella* species or other causes of enteric disease.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children ≥2 years:** The recommended dose is a single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection.  For individuals with continued or repeated exposure to *S. Typhi*, a booster dose of 0.5 mL IM is recommended every two years. The primary dose should be administered at least two weeks before anticipated exposure.  The vaccine is given IM, typically in the deltoid muscle (or anterolateral thigh in young children).  It should *not* be injected intravenously or into the gluteal region.  Do not mix with other vaccines or injections.

**Children <2 years:** The safety and efficacy of this vaccine have not been established in children under the age of 2.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients) include aches, fever, malaise, headache, and injection site reactions (tenderness, pain, soreness, induration).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% include fever (≥100°F), pruritus (itching), nausea, vomiting, injection site erythema (redness), and swelling, and myalgia (muscle pain).

Less common but serious side effects include allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other more severe reactions (see package insert for a complete list).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.

### How it Works
The Typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the Vi antigen of *Salmonella Typhi*.  The Vi antigen is a virulence factor that helps the bacteria evade the body's defenses. By producing antibodies against this antigen, the vaccine helps protect against typhoid fever.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the vaccine or any of its components.

**Interactions:**  The effectiveness of the vaccine may be reduced by concurrent use of certain antibiotics or immunoglobulins.  Mefloquine may increase its effectiveness. Immunosuppressants may increase the risk of adverse effects.  Consult your doctor about any medications you are taking before receiving this vaccine.

**Warnings:**  Use with caution in pregnant women (Category C pregnancy risk).  Delaying vaccination until the second or third trimester is recommended whenever possible.  The safety of this vaccine in breastfeeding women is unknown. It should be used cautiously in those with moderate or severe acute illness.  Patients should be observed for 15 minutes after vaccination for any allergic reaction or syncope.

### FAQs
**Q: Can I get typhoid fever from the vaccine?** A: No. This vaccine contains only the inactivated Vi polysaccharide antigen, not live bacteria, so it cannot cause typhoid fever.

**Q: How effective is the vaccine?** A: The effectiveness varies among individuals.  While it significantly reduces the risk of typhoid, it doesn't guarantee 100% protection.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Most side effects are mild and temporary.  However, if you experience severe allergic reactions or other serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

**Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A: Store the vaccine as directed by the manufacturer, typically refrigerated.

**Q: Does this vaccine protect against other types of Salmonella or other enteric diseases?** A: No, this vaccine only protects against typhoid fever caused by *Salmonella Typhi*.  It does not provide protection against other *Salmonella* species or other bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illness.
