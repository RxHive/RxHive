# Triflupromazine
### Generic Name
Triflupromazine

### Usage
Triflupromazine is a phenothiazine derivative that was primarily used as an antipsychotic medication to manage psychotic disorders.  It was also employed as an antiemetic to control nausea and vomiting.  However, it's important to note that **triflupromazine is no longer widely used or commercially available for human use in many regions**.  Its use has largely been discontinued due to the availability of newer, safer, and more effective antipsychotic and antiemetic medications with fewer side effects.

### Dosage
Because triflupromazine is no longer commonly prescribed, specific dosage recommendations are not readily available from current sources.  Any historical information regarding dosage should be considered outdated and unreliable for treatment purposes.  **Do not attempt to use this medication based on outdated information.**

### Side Effects
Triflupromazine, like other phenothiazines, carries a significant risk of adverse effects.  These can include, but are not limited to:

* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but life-threatening condition.
* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  Movement disorders such as muscle rigidity, tremors, and involuntary movements.
* **Sedation and drowsiness:**  Can impair alertness and coordination.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing.
* **Tachycardia:**  Rapid heart rate.
* **QTc prolongation:**  An abnormality in the heart's electrical activity.
* **Blood dyscrasias:**  Disorders of the blood cells.
* **Jaundice:**  Yellowing of the skin and eyes.
* **Various other side effects:**  Including dizziness, insomnia, anxiety, depression, headache, seizures, hyperpyrexia, peripheral edema, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), galactorrhea, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, breast engorgement, lactation, mastalgia, xerostomia, weight gain, weakness, nystagmus, blurred vision, keratopathy, lacrimation, pigment deposition, photosensitivity, dermatitis, and urticaria.


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works
Triflupromazine's mechanism of action as an antipsychotic isn't fully understood, but it is believed to involve blocking dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors in the brain. This blockage helps to reduce the symptoms of psychosis.  Its antiemetic effect is thought to be due to the blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the brain and the blockade of the vagus nerve in the gastrointestinal tract.

### Precautions
Because triflupromazine is largely obsolete, comprehensive current precautions are not readily available.  However, given its known side effects, it's crucial to understand that it's **contraindicated** in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other phenothiazines.  Caution is warranted in patients with cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal impairment, seizures, glaucoma, and prostate hypertrophy.  Its use in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and children should be avoided entirely due to potential risks.  Interactions with other medications are also a significant concern, and its concurrent use with other CNS depressants should be carefully considered.
