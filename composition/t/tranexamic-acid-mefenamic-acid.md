# Tranexamic Acid + Mefenamic Acid
### Generic Name
Tranexamic Acid + Mefenamic Acid

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve pain and reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).  Tranexamic acid works by reducing the breakdown of blood clots, thereby decreasing bleeding. Mefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation.  Together, they provide a dual approach to managing the symptoms associated with heavy periods. While this combination is primarily indicated for menorrhagia, some formulations might be used off-label to manage other types of bleeding with a pain component, though this should always be under a doctor's supervision and not self-prescribed.  It is crucial to understand that this is not a treatment for the underlying cause of heavy bleeding; it addresses the symptoms only.  A healthcare professional should investigate the cause of the menorrhagia.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (tablet strength, liquid suspension etc.), age, weight, and the severity of the bleeding and pain. **Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There is no standard universal dosage applicable to all patients.  For example, a typical adult dosage might involve one or two tablets taken multiple times daily for a specific duration, adjusting the frequency and duration as directed by the prescribing physician.  Pediatric use should only be under the strict guidance of a pediatrician, as dosage needs to be adjusted significantly based on the child's weight and age.  Intravenous administration of this particular combination is not typical; tranexamic acid and mefenamic acid are often administered separately intravenously when needed for specific medical situations.  Information about specific dosage forms and their instructions should be obtained directly from the medication's packaging or your healthcare provider.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach upset
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


Less common, but serious side effects may include:

* Seizures
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Blood clots (although tranexamic acid helps prevent some types, it can paradoxically increase the risk of others in certain situations)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Tranexamic acid inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down blood clots. By slowing down clot breakdown, it helps to reduce bleeding. Mefenamic acid reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to both pain sensation and inflammation.  This dual action helps alleviate both the heavy bleeding and the associated pain.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Do not use this medication if you are allergic to tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, or any NSAIDs.
* **Kidney or Liver Problems:** Use with caution in individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver disease.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Bleeding Disorders:**  While intended to reduce bleeding, this combination should be used cautiously in individuals with certain bleeding disorders or those at risk for blood clots.  Your doctor should carefully assess your risk profile.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before taking this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.  It's generally not recommended during the later stages of pregnancy.
* **Interactions:**  This medication can interact with other drugs, including blood thinners (anticoagulants) and certain other pain relievers.  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this combination and require lower doses.
