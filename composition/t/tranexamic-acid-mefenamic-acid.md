# Tranexamic Acid + Mefenamic Acid

**Generic Name:** Tranexamic Acid + Mefenamic Acid

**Usage:** This combination is typically used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).  It works by addressing two different aspects of bleeding: Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss by inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots, while mefenamic acid reduces pain and inflammation associated with menstruation.  It's important to note that this combination is *not* a first-line treatment for menorrhagia and should be prescribed by a doctor after considering other options.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary from person to person and can include:

* **Tranexamic Acid:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, fatigue, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), blood clots (rare but serious), seizures (rare), low blood pressure (rare).  In rare cases, it can cause blood clots to form in the veins (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
* **Mefenamic Acid:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, dizziness, headache, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  In rare cases, it can cause liver damage or severe allergic reactions.

**How it Works:**

* **Tranexamic Acid:** This is an antifibrinolytic agent.  It works by preventing the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis), thus helping to reduce bleeding.  It does this by inhibiting the activity of plasminogen activators, which are responsible for breaking down fibrin, a protein crucial for blood clot formation.
* **Mefenamic Acid:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandins, mefenamic acid helps alleviate menstrual cramps and pain associated with heavy bleeding.
