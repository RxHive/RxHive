# Tetracycline (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Tetracycline (Systemic)

### Usage
Tetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against a wide range of bacteria.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections, including but not limited to: acute intestinal amebiasis, actinomycosis, anthrax, cholera (caused by *Vibrio cholerae*), clostridial infections, and certain types of pneumonia. It's also used in treating chronic bronchitis exacerbations.  

A notable secondary use is in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  While not a first-line treatment for all cases, tetracycline can be effective in reducing acne inflammation and lesion counts.  Other off-label uses include treating certain sexually transmitted infections (syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients) and assisting in the eradication of *Helicobacter pylori*, the bacterium responsible for many stomach ulcers (though this typically requires a combination therapy).  Some sources also mention its use in treating tularemia and ehrlichiosis, but these are less common applications.  It's crucial to note that off-label uses should only be undertaken under the strict guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the infection being treated.  A common starting dose for many bacterial infections is 250-500 mg every 6-12 hours orally. For acne, treatment might begin with 1g daily in divided doses, gradually reducing to 125-500 mg/day as the condition improves.  Specific dosages for other conditions like cholera, syphilis, and *H. pylori* eradication are significantly different and are described below.  Always follow a healthcare professional’s precise instructions.


* **Susceptible Infections (e.g., acute intestinal amebiasis, actinomycosis, anthrax, clostridial infections):** Usual dose: 250–500 mg every 6–12 hours orally.

* **Acne:** Initial dose: 1 g daily in divided doses; reduced gradually to 125–500 mg/day once improvement is noted (intermittent therapy may suffice for some).

* **Cholera (*Vibrio cholerae* infection):** 500 mg four times daily (QID) for 3 days.

* **Chronic Bronchitis (acute exacerbation):** 500 mg QID.

* **Syphilis (penicillin-allergic patients):** 500 mg QID for 14 days (early syphilis) or 28 days (latent syphilis).

* **Tularemia (mild-to-moderate):** 500 mg QID for at least 14 days.

* **Ehrlichiosis:** 500 mg QID for 7–14 days.

* **Uncomplicated Malaria (off-label):** 250 mg QID for 7 days, usually combined with quinine sulfate.  For *Plasmodium vivax* or *Plasmodium ovale*, it's typically combined with primaquine.

* ***Helicobacter pylori* Eradication (off-label):**  Usually part of a multi-drug regimen (e.g., bismuth quadruple therapy) for 10–14 days.



**Pediatric Dosage:**  Tetracycline use is generally avoided in children under 8 years due to potential for permanent tooth discoloration.  When necessary for conditions where alternative treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, dosages are calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day), typically administered in divided doses every 6 hours. Specific pediatric dosages will be determined by a physician based on the child's age, weight, and the specific infection.  


**Dosage Adjustments:** Renal or hepatic impairment may necessitate dose reduction or altered dosing intervals. Always consult a physician for dosage adjustments based on individual patient needs.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustment guidelines for these conditions.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, epigastric distress.

* **Less Common but Serious:**  Photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity), liver damage (hepatotoxicity), kidney damage (nephropathy), pseudotumor cerebri (increased intracranial pressure),  allergic reactions (rash, hives, angioedema, anaphylaxis), esophageal irritation.  Tooth discoloration (in children under 8 years old and pregnant women in their second and third trimesters).

* **Rare but Serious:**  Growth retardation (especially in young children), blood disorders.

* **Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Tetracycline is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria rather than killing them directly.  It achieves this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit (and possibly the 50S subunit) within bacterial cells. This binding interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately preventing bacterial replication and growth.  The drug's effectiveness depends on the bacteria’s susceptibility to tetracycline.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to tetracycline, severe liver or kidney disease, pregnancy (second and third trimesters), children under 8 years old (except in certain situations where alternatives are unavailable).


* **Interactions:** Tetracycline can interact negatively with several medications, including antacids, calcium supplements, iron supplements, and some antibiotics.  It can also reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting tetracycline.


* **Warnings:**  Avoid prolonged sun exposure and tanning beds while taking tetracycline due to increased risk of photosensitivity.  Use with caution in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Tetracycline can cause tooth discoloration in children under 8 years old and pregnant women in the second and third trimester.  The use of outdated tetracycline can increase risk of Fanconi syndrome.


* **Specific Populations:**  Use during pregnancy is generally contraindicated, especially during the second and third trimesters.  Use in children under 8 is generally discouraged due to the risk of tooth discoloration. Breastfeeding mothers should consult their doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take tetracycline with milk or dairy products?** A: No. Dairy products interfere with tetracycline absorption, significantly reducing its effectiveness. Take it at least 1-2 hours before or 4 hours after consuming dairy.

* **Q: How should I store tetracycline?** A: Store tetracycline at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking tetracycline?** A:  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while on tetracycline.  Alcohol can negatively impact your liver, and this is especially important to consider while taking this medication.

* **Q: How long will it take to feel better?** A: This depends on the infection being treated and its severity. Improvement may be seen within a few days, but the full course of treatment should always be completed.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially severe ones.
