# Tafasitamab
### Generic Name
Tafasitamab

### Usage
Tafasitamab is a medication used in combination with lenalidomide to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  This includes DLBCL that originates from a low-grade lymphoma.  It's specifically indicated for patients who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).  The primary use is in this specific, challenging-to-treat lymphoma population.  There are currently no other approved uses for Tafasitamab.

### Dosage
Tafasitamab is administered intravenously (IV).  Premedication (e.g., acetaminophen, antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids) is typically given 30 minutes to 2 hours before each infusion to minimize infusion reactions.  For patients without reactions during the first three infusions, premedication may be optional thereafter. However, if a reaction occurs, premedication should be used for all subsequent infusions.

The dosage is 12 mg/kg, infused according to this schedule:

* **Cycle 1:** Days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle.
* **Cycles 2 and 3:** Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle.
* **Cycle 4 and beyond:** Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

Treatment continues for a maximum of 12 cycles with lenalidomide, followed by Tafasitamab monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  The label does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment, though studies show minimal impact on pharmacokinetics in mild renal impairment.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of Tafasitamab in children have not been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Peripheral edema
* Bronchitis, cough, dyspnea, respiratory tract infection
* Skin rash
* Decreased serum albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphate; hypokalemia; increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, glucose, and uric acid
* Abdominal pain, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* Anemia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, thrombocytopenia
* Increased aspartate aminotransferase levels
* Infection
* Asthenia, back pain, muscle spasm
* Increased serum creatinine
* Urinary tract infection
* Fever


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Infusion-related reactions, myelosuppression (low blood cell counts), and serious infections.  Always report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Tafasitamab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD19, a protein found on the surface of B cells (a type of white blood cell). By binding to CD19, Tafasitamab triggers the destruction of cancerous B cells through several mechanisms, including directly inducing cell death (apoptosis) and activating the body's immune system to attack the lymphoma cells (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity – ADCC and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis – ADCP).

### Precautions

* **Infusion Reactions:**  Infusion-related reactions are possible.  Close monitoring during infusions is crucial.  Premedication is often used to minimize these.
* **Myelosuppression:** Tafasitamab can suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor this.
* **Infections:** The risk of infection is increased due to myelosuppression.  Report any signs of infection immediately.
* **Pregnancy:** Tafasitamab may harm a developing fetus.  Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.  It is contraindicated in pregnancy, as is lenalidomide, its partner drug in this regimen.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least 3 months after the final dose due to the potential harm to the infant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions are not comprehensively listed, interactions with other medications are possible.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment last?**  A: Treatment typically involves a combination of Tafasitamab and lenalidomide for up to 12 cycles, followed by Tafasitamab alone until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience an infusion reaction?**  A: Inform your healthcare provider immediately.  The infusion may need to be slowed or stopped.
* **Q: How is Tafasitamab stored?**  A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood. Regular monitoring is essential.
* **Q: Can I take other medications while on Tafasitamab?** A:  Always discuss any medications you are taking (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) with your healthcare provider before starting treatment with Tafasitamab.
