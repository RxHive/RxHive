# Tolazoline
### Generic Name
Tolazoline

### Usage
Tolazoline is primarily used as a vasodilator.  Its main application is in treating persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), also known as persistent fetal circulation.  This condition occurs when blood vessels in a newborn's lungs remain constricted after birth, hindering proper oxygenation. Tolazoline helps relax these blood vessels, improving blood flow to the lungs.  It's also used to treat peripheral vasospastic disorders, conditions where blood vessels in the extremities constrict, causing pain and reduced circulation.  Examples include Raynaud's phenomenon and acrocyanosis.  While not its primary use, it has been explored in treating other conditions involving vascular constriction but its use in these areas is less common and requires further clinical investigation.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Peripheral Vascular Disease:**  The oral dosage is typically 25-50 mg four times a day (QID).  For intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SubQ), or intra-arterial administration, doses up to 50 mg may be used but this should be under strict medical supervision and dosing guidance.
* **Peripheral Vasospastic Disorders:**  For IM, IV, or SubQ administration, the dose is usually 10-50 mg QID.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children, especially newborns, is critically dependent on weight and must be determined and closely monitored by a physician.

* **Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN):**  The initial IV dose is typically 1 mg/kg given as a bolus over 2-5 minutes.  A continuous infusion of 200 mcg/kg/hour may be given as a maintenance dose, with a maximum dose generally not exceeding 300 mcg/kg/hour.  Administration is typically via a scalp vein or upper extremity.  Endotracheal administration (directly into the trachea) is possible in specific circumstances, usually involving a 200 mcg/kg dose.
* **Acute Vasospasm (e.g., in catheterized toes):**  A continuous IV infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/hour is often used, without a loading dose.  The maximum dose typically does not exceed 6-8 mg/kg/hour.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.  Always consult with a doctor for personalized dosage information.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Flushing (redness of the skin)
* Headache
* Increased heart rate
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)


Less common, but serious, side effects may include:

* Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage
* Pulmonary hemorrhage
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Pancytopenia (low counts of all blood cells)
* Increased agranulocytosis (low white blood cell count)
* Increased pilomotor activity (goosebumps)
* Hypochloremic alkalosis (electrolyte imbalance)
* Oliguria (reduced urine output)
* Acute renal failure
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation)
* Increased secretions
* Injection site burning or pain.

Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.

### How it Works

Tolazoline is a direct-acting peripheral vasodilator.  It works by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscles of blood vessels.  This blockage prevents the effects of norepinephrine and other vasoconstricting substances, allowing the blood vessels to relax and widen. The resulting vasodilation reduces peripheral vascular resistance and improves blood flow, particularly to the lungs in the case of PPHN, or the extremities in cases of peripheral vasospasm. It also indirectly inhibits catecholamine-induced hypertension.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tolazoline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to tolazoline or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients may have an increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hypotension, and blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in blood cells).
* **Caution:** Tolazoline should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing hypotension, mitral stenosis (a heart valve disorder), ischemic heart disease, stroke, gastritis, peptic ulcers, and renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Tolazoline can interact with various medications, including alpha/beta-agonists, alpha-1 blockers, antihypertensives, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, MAOIs, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin analogs. These interactions can significantly alter the effects of either drug, potentially causing adverse effects. Close monitoring and potential dose adjustments are necessary when tolazoline is used concomitantly with these other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Tolazoline is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. The excretion of tolazoline in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised if breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take tolazoline with food?** A: Tolazoline may be taken with or without food.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking tolazoline?** A: It's advisable to avoid alcohol while taking tolazoline as it may increase the risk of hypotension.
* **Q: How should I store tolazoline?** A:  Storage instructions will vary depending on the formulation, so always refer to the specific product labeling. Generally, it's crucial to keep the medication in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not try to make up for a missed dose; simply take the next dose as scheduled unless your physician provides other instructions.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking tolazoline suddenly?** A: No, always consult your physician before stopping tolazoline.  Stopping abruptly may have negative health consequences.
