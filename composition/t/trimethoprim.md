# Trimethoprim
### Generic Name
Trimethoprim

### Usage
Trimethoprim is primarily used as an antibacterial agent. Its main application is in treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).  It's also used to treat acute otitis media (middle ear infection) in children.  While not its primary use, trimethoprim may be used off-label in combination with other drugs for conditions such as *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP) associated with HIV infection and, less commonly, in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  It's important to note that off-label uses should only be undertaken under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Uncomplicated UTIs:** The typical oral dose is 100 mg twice daily (BID) or 200 mg once daily (OD) for 10 days.  Some guidelines recommend a shorter course of 100 mg BID for 3 days for acute uncomplicated cystitis.
* **Prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs (off-label):**  100 mg once daily for 3-12 months.
* **PCP (mild to moderate, in combination with dapsone, off-label):** 15 mg/kg/day divided into three doses for 21 days.
* **Acne vulgaris (off-label):** 100 mg three times daily (TID) or 300 mg BID.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Acute otitis media:** 10 mg/kg/day divided into two doses, given every 12 hours for 10 days.  The maximum daily dose is 400 mg.
* **Uncomplicated UTIs (off-label):** 4-6 mg/kg/day divided into two doses, given every 12 hours.
* **PCP (off-label, in combination with dapsone):** 15 mg/kg/day divided into three doses for 21 days.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are often needed for individuals with renal impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional or refer to prescribing information for specific guidelines based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels.  There are no specific dosage adjustments recommended for hepatic impairment, but caution is advised.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Epigastric distress (upper abdominal discomfort)
* Diarrhea
* Rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Megaloblastic anemia
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis


If any adverse effects occur, particularly severe or unusual ones, seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works

Trimethoprim is a type of antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR is an enzyme essential for the synthesis of folic acid, a crucial molecule for bacterial DNA and RNA production. By blocking DHFR, trimethoprim prevents bacteria from producing the necessary building blocks for their genetic material, ultimately inhibiting their growth and replication.  This mechanism targets bacteria specifically and generally doesn't affect human cells to the same degree, although it can affect folate metabolism.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Trimethoprim is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or any formulation components, and those with megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Trimethoprim can interact with various medications, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, antidiabetic agents (thiazolidinediones), and QTc-prolonging agents. Consult a healthcare professional about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, folate deficiency (e.g., malnutrition, elderly individuals), and neonates.  Trimethoprim can interfere with hematopoiesis (blood cell formation) and may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.  Monitor for signs of superinfection, such as *Clostridium difficile* diarrhea.  It's classified as pregnancy category C.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Trimethoprim is not recommended during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. It's excreted in breast milk, so use should be approached cautiously while breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take trimethoprim with food?** A: Trimethoprim can be taken with or without food.  If gastrointestinal upset occurs, it can be taken with food or milk.
* **Q: How should I store trimethoprim?** A: Store trimethoprim at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The time it takes to notice improvement varies depending on the infection but symptom relief is often seen within a few days.  Finish the entire course of medication, even if feeling better.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking trimethoprim?** A:  Consult your doctor.  While there isn't a direct contraindication, alcohol can sometimes exacerbate side effects such as nausea.
