# Thiabendazole
### Generic Name
Thiabendazole

### Usage
Thiabendazole, a benzimidazole derivative, is primarily an anti-infective/anthelmintic medication.  Its main uses are in treating several parasitic worm infections: strongyloidiasis (a roundworm infection), cutaneous larva migrans ("creeping eruption," caused by hookworm larvae), and visceral larva migrans (caused by the larvae of roundworms).  It has also been used in the past for other parasitic infections such as trichinosis (caused by eating undercooked pork containing Trichinella worms), dracunculiasis (guinea worm disease), and toxocariasis (caused by Toxocara roundworm larvae). However, due to the availability of better-tolerated alternatives, its use in these conditions is now limited. In many regions, Thiabendazole has been withdrawn from clinical use and is primarily used in veterinary medicine.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**  Dosage is typically calculated based on body weight (mg/kg) and administered twice daily (BID) for a specified duration.  The maximum daily dose is usually 3000 mg.  Exact durations and dosages vary considerably depending on the specific parasitic infection being treated:

* **Cutaneous larva migrans:** 25 mg/kg BID for 2 days.
* **Strongyloidiasis:** 25 mg/kg BID for 2-3 days, or 50 mg/kg as a single dose.  May be extended to 5 days for disseminated infections.
* **Dracunculiasis:** 25-50 mg/kg BID for 1 day; a second dose may be given after 5-8 days in severe cases.
* **Trichinosis:** 25 mg/kg BID for 2-4 days.
* **Toxocariasis:** 25 mg/kg BID for 5-7 days.
* **Trichostrongyliasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis:** 25 mg/kg BID for 2 consecutive days.


**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):**  Dosage for children older than 2 years is generally similar to adults, calculated by body weight (mg/kg) and typically administered twice daily.  The maximum daily dose remains 3000 mg.  Specific durations vary according to infection:

* **Visceral larva migrans:** 25 mg/kg BID for 7 days.
* **Trichinosis:** 25 mg/kg BID for 2-4 days.
* **Dracunculiasis:** 25 mg/kg BID for 3 days.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when using this medication in such patients.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Abdominal pain
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Blurred vision
* Changes in urine (color, odor)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Erythema multiforme (a skin reaction)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a life-threatening skin reaction)
* Liver damage
* Changes in blood cell counts

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Thiabendazole's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to interfere with the energy production of parasitic worms by inhibiting their fumarate reductase system.  This ultimately leads to their death or impaired ability to survive and reproduce. It also possesses some antifungal properties.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Thiabendazole is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or its components, for prophylactic treatment of pinworm infestations, and for mixed worm infections involving *Ascaris lumbricoides*.
* **Interactions:** Concurrent use with theophylline or caffeine may inhibit the metabolism of the latter.  Increased anticoagulant effect is possible when used with coumarins.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, malnutrition, or anemia.  Potentially fatal adverse reactions, such as those listed in the side effects section, are possible.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before using this medication.  The information regarding the excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Pregnancy Category C:** Thiabendazole is assigned to pregnancy category C.  This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  The drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Thiabendazole with food?** A: Yes, taking it with food can help reduce gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Q: Are there safer alternatives to Thiabendazole?** A: Yes, ivermectin, albendazole, and mebendazole are generally preferred due to better tolerability and fewer serious side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I overdose on Thiabendazole?** A: Seek immediate medical attention. Gastric lavage or induced vomiting may be considered, along with supportive care.  There is no specific antidote.
* **Q: How should I store Thiabendazole?** A: Store according to the instructions on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q:  Should I take Thiabendazole if I have liver or kidney problems?** A: Use with caution and under the close supervision of a physician.  Dose adjustments are not specifically defined.
