# Tolcapone
### Generic Name
Tolcapone

### Usage
Tolcapone is a medication used to treat the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  Specifically, it's used as an *add-on* therapy for people already taking levodopa/carbidopa who experience fluctuations in their symptoms (periods of good and bad motor control).  It's not a first-line treatment for Parkinson's; it's reserved for those whose symptoms aren't adequately managed with levodopa/carbidopa alone.  The primary goal is to improve motor control and reduce the "off" periods experienced by patients.  It works by enhancing the effects of levodopa.

### Dosage
Tolcapone is administered orally.  The typical starting dose for adults is 100 mg three times daily (TID), *always* in combination with levodopa/carbidopa.  The dose may be increased to 200 mg TID only if a patient shows significant clinical improvement and their healthcare provider deems it appropriate.  This higher dose is associated with a greater risk of liver enzyme elevation.  If there's no improvement after three weeks of treatment, regardless of the dose, the medication should be discontinued.  There is no established safe and effective dosage for children.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (though specific guidelines for severe impairment are not clearly defined in manufacturer labeling), but it's contraindicated in those with liver disease.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Tolcapone can include:

*   Drowsiness
*   Sleep disturbances
*   Hallucinations
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing)
*   Increased dream activity
*   Muscle cramps
*   Dyskinesia (involuntary movements)


Less common, but serious side effects include liver damage (hepatotoxicity), potentially leading to liver failure.  This is a significant concern and necessitates careful monitoring of liver enzymes.  Other serious side effects may include  rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) and  severe behavioral changes.  If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Tolcapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor.  COMT is an enzyme that breaks down levodopa, a crucial medication for Parkinson's disease. By inhibiting COMT, Tolcapone helps prevent the breakdown of levodopa, resulting in higher and more consistent levels of levodopa in the bloodstream.  This leads to improved dopamine levels in the brain, helping to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

### Precautions
Tolcapone is contraindicated in patients with:

*   A history of liver disease.
*   A known allergy to Tolcapone or its components.
*   A history of Tolcapone-induced liver injury.


It should be used with extreme caution in patients with severe kidney disease, pre-existing dyskinesias, or those taking other CNS depressants.  Regular monitoring of liver function is essential, especially during the first six months of treatment and following any dose increase.  The risk of serious liver injury is significant, and the medication should be discontinued if liver enzyme levels are elevated or symptoms of liver damage appear.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using Tolcapone.  Patients should be informed about the increased risk of skin cancer (melanoma) and should undergo periodic skin examinations.  They should also be monitored for severe behavioral changes and impulse control disorders.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Tolcapone without levodopa/carbidopa?**  A: No, Tolcapone is only used as an add-on therapy with levodopa/carbidopa.  It doesn't work independently.

*   **Q: How often should my liver enzymes be checked?** A: Liver enzyme levels (ALT and AST) should be checked regularly, especially in the first six months of treatment, and following any dose increase, as per your healthcare providerâ€™s recommendation.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

*   **Q: Can I suddenly stop taking Tolcapone?** A: No, stopping Tolcapone suddenly can be harmful.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually tapering off the medication.

*   **Q: How should I store Tolcapone?** A: Store Tolcapone as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

*   **Q: Is Tolcapone safe for everyone?**  A: No, Tolcapone carries significant risks, particularly for those with liver disease, and is not appropriate for everyone with Parkinson's disease.  It should only be used under the close supervision of a healthcare provider.
