# Tranilast (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Tranilast (Systemic)

### Usage

Tranilast is a medication primarily used for the long-term management (maintenance therapy) of several conditions.  Its main applications include:

* **Bronchial Asthma:** Tranilast helps control asthma symptoms but is *not* for immediate relief during an acute asthma attack. It's used as an add-on therapy to other asthma medications.
* **Keloids and Hypertrophic Scars:** Tranilast helps reduce the size and severity of these raised, often unsightly scars.
* **Allergic Disorders:** This includes conditions like allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and atopic dermatitis (eczema). Tranilast helps manage the symptoms of these allergic reactions.

While not its primary use, Tranilast might also be considered in certain cases for other allergic conditions, but this should always be guided by a physician's assessment.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The following represents general guidelines:

**Adults (Oral):**

* **Allergic Rhinitis, Atopic Dermatitis, Keloids/Hypertrophic Scars, Asthma Maintenance:** The typical dose is 100 mg three times daily (TID). For seasonal allergic rhinitis, treatment usually starts before the allergy season and continues until the season ends.  Asthma requires several weeks of treatment before its effectiveness is seen.  *Tranilast is not a rescue medication for acute asthma attacks.*

**Children (Oral - typically dry syrup or granules):**

* **Allergic Rhinitis, Atopic Dermatitis, Keloids/Hypertrophic Scars, Asthma Maintenance:** The usual dose is 5 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses.  The maximum daily dose is 300 mg. For seasonal allergic rhinitis, similar timing as for adults applies.  Tranilast is generally *not* the first-line treatment for asthma in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised, and close monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential in these cases.

### How it Works

Tranilast works primarily by stabilizing mast cells.  Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other substances involved in allergic reactions.  By stabilizing these cells, Tranilast reduces the release of these inflammatory mediators, lessening the symptoms of allergic conditions like asthma, rhinitis, and eczema.

In the case of keloids and hypertrophic scars, Tranilast also inhibits the production and release of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1), a protein that plays a role in scar tissue formation.  This action contributes to the reduction in scar size and elevation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tranilast is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Tranilast or any of its components, and in pregnant or potentially pregnant women.
* **Increased Risk:**  Tranilast can increase the risk of renal (kidney), hepatic (liver), and hematologic (blood) adverse effects.  Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function, as well as complete blood counts, may be necessary.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tranilast may interact with warfarin (a blood thinner), potentially increasing the risk of bleeding or reducing warfarin's effectiveness.  Careful monitoring is essential if Tranilast is used concurrently with warfarin.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease.
* **Children:** While used in children, it's generally not considered a first-line treatment for asthma.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tranilast is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, and breastfeeding is not recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time to see a therapeutic effect varies depending on the condition. For seasonal allergies, it may take at least 2 weeks. For asthma, several weeks of treatment may be needed.
* **Q: Can I take Tranilast with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions are possible, particularly with warfarin.
* **Q: How should I store Tranilast?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, usually in a cool and dry place away from direct sunlight.  Specific storage instructions may vary depending on the formulation (e.g., tablets, syrup).
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose to catch up.
* **Q: Is Tranilast addictive?** A:  Tranilast is not considered an addictive substance.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Tranilast suddenly?** A:  Do not stop taking Tranilast suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Your doctor may recommend a gradual tapering off of the medication.
