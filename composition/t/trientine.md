# Trientine
### Generic Name
Trientine

### Usage
Trientine, also known as triethylenetetramine (TETA), is a medication primarily used to treat Wilson's disease.  Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder that causes the body to retain too much copper, leading to potentially serious damage to the liver, brain, and other organs.  Trientine is specifically indicated for patients with Wilson's disease who cannot tolerate penicillamine, another medication used to treat this condition.  It's important to note that trientine is not used to treat cystinuria, rheumatoid arthritis, or biliary cirrhosis.

### Dosage

**Wilson's Disease:**

* **Adults:** The initial oral dose typically ranges from 750 to 1250 mg per day, divided into 2 to 4 doses.  The dose may be increased if the patient's response is inadequate, or if serum copper levels remain above 20 mcg/dL. The maximum daily dose is 2000 mg.  Dosage adjustments should be made every 6-12 months based on ongoing monitoring.

* **Children and Adolescents:**  The starting oral dose is usually 20 mg/kg/day, rounded to the nearest 250 mg and given in 2-3 divided doses. The maximum initial dose is 1000 mg/day for children and 1500 mg/day for adolescents.  The dose is adjusted based on the child's clinical response, serum copper levels, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion. The usual maintenance dose is 900-1500 mg/day for children and up to 2000 mg/day for adolescents.  


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Trientine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Treatment for Wilson's disease should generally continue during pregnancy, but a dose reduction (25-50% of the pre-pregnancy dose) may be considered.  It is unknown whether trientine is excreted in breast milk, therefore caution is advised during breastfeeding.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** The frequency of these side effects isn't precisely defined in available literature.

* Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., gastritis)
* Iron deficiency

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** These are reported less frequently, often in post-marketing surveillance or case reports:

* Nervous system problems (e.g., dystonia, myasthenia gravis, neurological deterioration)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., fixed drug eruption)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal issues (e.g., muscle spasm, systemic lupus erythematosus)
* Blood disorders (e.g., aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, sideroblastic anemia)

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Trientine is a chelating agent, meaning it binds to and removes excess copper from the body. Unlike penicillamine, it has a different chemical structure.  By binding to copper, trientine facilitates its excretion in the urine (cupriuresis), thereby reducing the harmful buildup of copper in the body's tissues.  This helps to prevent or lessen the damage caused by copper accumulation in Wilson's disease.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Trientine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to trientine or any component of its formulation.

* **Increased Risk:** Trientine therapy may increase the risk of iron-deficiency anemia (especially in women), copper deficiency, hepatic iron overload/sideroblastic anemia, and neurological worsening.  Careful monitoring is crucial.

* **Caution:** Use with caution in elderly patients.

* **Drug Interactions:** Trientine's levels/effects might be reduced by carbonic anhydrase inhibitor diuretics and products containing polyvalent cations.

* **General Precautions:**  Administer trientine at least one hour before or two hours after meals.  Keep it separate from other medications, food, or milk by at least one hour.  Capsules should be swallowed whole; do not open or chew them. Wash any skin exposed to the capsule contents with water immediately.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is trientine stored?**  A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I take trientine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting trientine.  Some interactions may occur.

* **Q: How often will I need to see my doctor while on trientine?** A: Regular monitoring, including blood tests and urine tests, is necessary to assess the effectiveness of treatment and check for side effects.  The frequency of visits will be determined by your healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of trientine?** A: Long-term use can lead to copper deficiency and potentially other complications.  Regular monitoring is essential to detect and manage any such issues.
