# Triprolidine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Triprolidine and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu, such as runny nose, sneezing, and cough.  Triprolidine is an antihistamine that helps dry up a runny nose and sneezing. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant (an antitussive) that helps relieve a cough.  It's important to note that this medication does *not* treat the underlying cause of the cold or flu, only the symptoms.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, especially with the antihistamine component.
* **Dry mouth:**  Another frequent side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be mild to moderate.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Constipation:**  Less common but possible.
* **Headache:** Can occur.
* **Blurred vision:** Less common.
* **Difficulty urinating:** Less common.

**Serious side effects are rare but include:**  allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), fast heartbeat, seizures.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  This list is not exhaustive, and you should consult the medication's package insert for a complete list.

**How it Works:**

* **Triprolidine:** This antihistamine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Dextromethorphan:** This cough suppressant works in the central nervous system to reduce the cough reflex. It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough but reduces the urge to cough.
