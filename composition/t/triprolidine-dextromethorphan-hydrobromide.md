# Triprolidine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Triprolidine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

### Usage
Triprolidine and dextromethorphan hydrobromide is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu.  It's primarily used to treat coughs and runny noses associated with these upper respiratory infections. Triprolidine is an antihistamine that helps to dry up runny noses by reducing the body's production of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions and infections. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that works in the brain to reduce the cough reflex.  This combination medication addresses both the runny nose and cough symptoms, offering symptomatic relief.  It is important to remember that this medication only treats *symptoms* and does not cure the underlying infection.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablets, syrup) and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and the information on the product label carefully.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**

* **Adults and Children over 12 years:**  Dosage varies widely depending on the brand and formulation.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate dosage instructions. Typical dosages range from one to two tablets or teaspoons of liquid medicine every 4-6 hours as needed. 
* **Children under 12 years:** This combination medication is generally **not recommended** for children under 12 years of age.  Always consult a pediatrician before administering any medication to a child.  They may prescribe alternative age-appropriate medications for cough and cold symptoms.

**Oral Administration:** Tablets or liquids should be taken with a full glass of water.  

**IV Administration:** This combination medication is not available for intravenous (IV) administration.  It is only available in oral forms.

* Drowsiness

If you experience any serious or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Triprolidine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine in the body. Histamine causes blood vessels to dilate, leading to a runny nose and nasal congestion. By blocking histamine, triprolidine helps reduce these symptoms.  Dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant, acts on the brain to reduce the cough reflex. It doesn't address the underlying cause of the cough, but it makes coughing less frequent.  The combination of these two active ingredients provides relief from both the runny nose and cough associated with colds and the flu.
