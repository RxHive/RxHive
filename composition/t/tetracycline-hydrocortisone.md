# Tetracycline + Hydrocortisone
### Generic Name
Tetracycline + Hydrocortisone

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat various bacterial infections of the eye, particularly those involving inflammation.  Tetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, targets a wide range of bacteria, effectively combating the infection. Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and swelling, providing symptomatic relief and promoting faster healing.  The combined effect makes this medication particularly effective for conditions where both bacterial infection and inflammation are present.  Specific conditions treated may include bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye), blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid), and other similar ocular infections.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is specifically for *eye infections* and should not be used for systemic bacterial infections or other inflammatory conditions elsewhere in the body.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions are always provided by a healthcare professional and will be specific to the individual and the condition.  There is no standard "over-the-counter" formulation of this combination.  It is usually dispensed as an ophthalmic ointment or drops. The typical application involves instilling a small amount of the medication into the affected eye(s) several times a day, as directed by a doctor.  The dosage will depend on the severity of the infection and the individual's response to treatment.  **Never adjust the dosage without consulting a doctor.**  Children's dosage will generally be adjusted by weight or age and determined by the physician. Oral or IV administration is not relevant for this topical eye medication.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Burning or stinging sensation upon application, temporary blurred vision, mild eye irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Increased eye pressure (glaucoma), eye infection worsening, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), visual disturbances.  Rarely, prolonged use might cause thinning of the cornea.

If you experience any of these side effects, especially those that are persistent or severe, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works

Tetracycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, effectively preventing bacterial growth and killing the bacteria causing the infection. Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, works by reducing inflammation by suppressing the body's inflammatory response. This dual action helps to quickly control both the infection and the associated swelling and discomfort in the eye. The combined effects lead to faster healing and resolution of symptoms.
