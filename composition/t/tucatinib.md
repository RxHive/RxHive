# Tucatinib
### Generic Name
Tucatinib

### Usage
Tucatinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat adults with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.  This means the cancer has spread and cannot be surgically removed, and the cancer cells have a high number of HER2 receptors.  It's specifically indicated for patients who have already received one or more other HER2-targeted treatments for their metastatic disease.  Tucatinib is used in combination with other medications, usually trastuzumab and capecitabine.  It is sometimes used in patients with brain metastases (cancer that has spread to the brain).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Breast Cancer):** The typical adult dose is 300 mg twice daily (BID), taken orally. This is administered in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine.  The recommended dose of capecitabine in this combination therapy is 1000 mg/m² BID, taken within 30 minutes of a meal. Tucatinib and capecitabine can be taken at the same time. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Tucatinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, no initial dose adjustment is needed.  However, those with severe impairment should start at a reduced dose of 200 mg BID.  Dose adjustments during treatment are also made based on the severity of liver enzyme elevations (ALT, AST, bilirubin).  Treatment may be held or permanently discontinued depending on the severity of liver toxicity.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment do not require dosage adjustment. However, Tucatinib is not recommended for those with severe kidney impairment because it's used in combination with capecitabine, which is contraindicated in this group.

* **Toxicity Management:**  Dose reductions are implemented in case of intolerable side effects. For example, Grade 3 diarrhea requires dose modification or treatment discontinuation.  Other Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions may also necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Diarrhea
* Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome)
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Weight loss
* Anemia
* Decreased appetite
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) – increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST, bilirubin)

Less common but serious side effects include seizures and severe allergic reactions.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tucatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of HER2, a protein that promotes the growth and spread of cancer cells.  By inhibiting HER2, Tucatinib interferes with crucial signaling pathways (MAPK and AKT) within the cancer cells, slowing or stopping their growth and proliferation.  The combination with trastuzumab, another HER2 inhibitor, enhances this effect.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Tucatinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.
* **Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Tucatinib or for at least one week following the last dose due to the potential for drug excretion in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tucatinib interacts with certain other medications.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specifically, strong CYP3A inducers or moderate CYP2C8 inducers can decrease Tucatinib levels, while strong or moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors can increase them. It can also interact with CYP3A and P-glycoprotein substrates, increasing their plasma concentrations.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are crucial in patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **General Precautions:**  Patients should swallow the tablets whole and not chew, crush, or split them. If vomiting or a missed dose occurs, the next dose should be taken as soon as possible.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Tucatinib with food?** A: Tucatinib can be taken with or without food.  However, remember that capecitabine, which is usually taken in combination with Tucatinib, should be taken within 30 minutes of a meal.

* **Q: How should I store Tucatinib?** A: Store Tucatinib tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Tucatinib?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is crucial to detect and manage potential side effects.

* **Q: Is Tucatinib suitable for all types of breast cancer?** A: No. Tucatinib is specifically used for HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed despite prior HER2-targeted therapy.
