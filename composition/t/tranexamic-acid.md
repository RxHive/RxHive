# Tranexamic Acid

**Generic Name:** Tranexamic Acid

**Usage:**

Tranexamic acid is used to control or reduce bleeding.  Its primary uses include:

* **Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia):** This is a common use, helping to reduce blood loss during periods.
* **Post-surgical bleeding:**  It's often given after surgery to minimize bleeding, particularly in surgeries involving the nose, mouth, or gynecological procedures.
* **Bleeding after tooth extraction:**  It can help control bleeding after dental procedures.
* **Trauma-related bleeding:** In cases of significant injury and uncontrolled bleeding, it may be used to help stabilize the patient before more extensive treatment.
* **Hereditary angioedema:** This is a rare condition causing swelling and can lead to life-threatening airway compromise; tranexamic acid can help reduce attack frequency and severity.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These are relatively common.
* **Diarrhoea:**  Another common gastrointestinal side effect.
* **Headache:**  A fairly frequent side effect.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):**  More serious and requires medical attention.
* **Seizures:** Rare but serious side effect.
* **Blood clots (thromboembolic events):** This is a serious risk, especially in patients with a history of blood clots.  This includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (anaphylaxis) are possible, although rare.
* **Vision problems:**  Blurred vision or other visual disturbances have been reported.


**How it Works:**

Tranexamic acid works by inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis).  It does this by blocking the action of plasminogen activators, enzymes that dissolve blood clots.  By preventing the breakdown of blood clots, it helps to maintain blood clotting and reduce bleeding.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Tranexamic Acid a blood thinner or a blood thickener?**  It's neither. It prevents the *breakdown* of blood clots, making it functionally a "blood thickener" in situations of excessive bleeding, but it does not increase the initial formation of blood clots in the same way anticoagulants do.

* **Can I take Tranexamic Acid without a doctor's prescription?**  No. Tranexamic acid should only be used under the supervision of a doctor or other healthcare professional due to potential side effects and interactions with other medications.

* **Who should not take Tranexamic Acid?** Individuals with a history of blood clots, severe kidney problems, or certain types of allergies should not take tranexamic acid.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss its use with their doctor.

* **How is Tranexamic Acid administered?**  It can be administered intravenously (IV), orally (as tablets or capsules), or topically (for certain applications). The specific method depends on the situation and the doctor's recommendation.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any serious side effects, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe allergic reactions, seek immediate medical attention. For less severe side effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist.  Always report any unexpected effects to your healthcare provider.
