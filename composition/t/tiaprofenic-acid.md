# Tiaprofenic Acid
### Generic Name
Tiaprofenic Acid

### Usage
Tiaprofenic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  Its main function is to reduce pain and inflammation associated with these conditions. While not explicitly indicated for other conditions in official prescribing information, it may offer some relief from other inflammatory pain, though this should always be confirmed with a doctor.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical starting and maintenance dose for both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is 600 mg per day, divided into two to three doses.  In rare cases, a lower dose of 300 mg/day may be sufficient.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 600 mg.  The medication is usually administered orally in tablet form.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Children:** Tiaprofenic acid is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment, but caution is advised.  For renal (kidney) impairment, dosage adjustment is recommended because tiaprofenic acid is primarily eliminated through the kidneys.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your individual health status.

### How it Works

Tiaprofenic acid is a non-selective NSAID that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, tiaprofenic acid alleviates pain and inflammation.  It's important to note that while the primary mechanism is COX inhibition, other mechanisms may play a secondary role in its anti-inflammatory effects.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Tiaprofenic acid is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug, aspirin, or other NSAIDs; those with active peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal inflammatory disease; and those who have experienced acute asthma attacks, urticaria (hives), rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes), or other allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs.

**Interactions:** Tiaprofenic acid may interact with various medications, including corticosteroids, salicylates, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors, SSRIs, and loop diuretics. These interactions can increase the risk of bleeding, kidney damage, or other adverse effects. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

**Warnings:**  Tiaprofenic acid carries a risk of serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications, including heart attack, stroke, and bleeding.  Caution is advised for patients with a history of cardiovascular or gastrointestinal disease, hypertension, fluid retention, or those who smoke or drink alcohol.  The elderly and debilitated individuals may be more susceptible to side effects.  Use during pregnancy is generally not recommended, especially after 20 weeks gestation, due to potential risks to the fetus. Breastfeeding is also not advised.
