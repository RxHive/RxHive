# Trilaciclib
### Generic Name
Trilaciclib

### Usage

Trilaciclib is a medication primarily used to reduce the severity of myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression) caused by chemotherapy.  Specifically, it's approved for use in adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) receiving certain chemotherapy regimens. These regimens include those containing platinum and etoposide, or topotecan.  Myelosuppression is a common and potentially serious side effect of these chemotherapy drugs, leading to decreased white blood cell counts (increasing infection risk), red blood cell counts (causing anemia), and platelet counts (increasing bleeding risk). Trilaciclib helps to mitigate this risk, allowing patients to tolerate higher doses of chemotherapy or experience fewer chemotherapy-related interruptions.  It does *not* treat small cell lung cancer directly; its role is solely to protect the bone marrow during chemotherapy treatment.

### Dosage

Trilaciclib is administered intravenously (IV).  The recommended dose for adults with ES-SCLC experiencing chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression is 240 mg/mÂ² per dose.  This infusion should be given over 30 minutes and completed within 4 hours before the start of each day's chemotherapy. The interval between doses on consecutive days shouldn't exceed 28 hours.  If Trilaciclib is stopped, chemotherapy should not resume for 96 hours after the last Trilaciclib dose.

**Important Note:**  The dosage information provided is a summary. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions. Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient factors and response to treatment.  There is no established dosage for children.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Low calcium levels (hypocalcemia)
* Low potassium levels (hypokalemia)
* Low phosphorus levels (hypophosphatemia)
* Increased levels of AST (liver enzyme)
* Injection site reactions

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Acute hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)
* Other serious side effects


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Trilaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.  CDK4 and 6 are enzymes that play a crucial role in the cell cycle, particularly in the proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). HSPCs are the cells in bone marrow that give rise to all blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). By temporarily inhibiting CDK4 and 6, Trilaciclib reduces the rate at which HSPCs divide and thus makes them less susceptible to the damaging effects of chemotherapy.  This protective effect allows for better preservation of bone marrow function during and after chemotherapy.


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Trilaciclib is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to Trilaciclib or its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Trilaciclib may interact with other medications, such as dofetilide (increasing the risk of irregular heartbeats) and dalfampridine (increasing seizure risk).  It may also increase cisplatin's nephrotoxicity (kidney damage). Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Trilaciclib can harm a developing fetus.  Pregnant women should not take this medication. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and for at least three weeks after treatment.  It is not known if Trilaciclib is excreted in breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least three weeks afterward.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment is not recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:** While dosage adjustments aren't specifically indicated in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with reduced kidney function, close monitoring is recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Trilaciclib to work?**  A: Trilaciclib's protective effect is observed during and immediately following chemotherapy.  The impact on myelosuppression is assessed by measuring blood counts after the completion of the chemotherapy cycles.

* **Q: How is Trilaciclib stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions. Generally, it should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Trilaciclib if I feel better?** A:  No.  Do not stop or alter the prescribed course of Trilaciclib without consulting your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately. Your chemotherapy dose may need to be adjusted.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with Trilaciclib?** A:  Long-term effects are still under investigation. Regular monitoring by your physician is important.
