# Terbinafine + Clobetasol
### Generic Name
Terbinafine + Clobetasol


### Usage

Terbinafine and clobetasol combination cream is primarily used to treat skin infections caused by dermatophytes (fungi) that are also inflamed. This means it tackles both the fungal infection (terbinafine's role) and the accompanying inflammation (clobetasol's role).  It's commonly prescribed for conditions like tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), tinea corporis (ringworm), and other fungal skin infections that present with redness, itching, and swelling.  It's important to note that this is a topical medication; it's applied directly to the skin and isn't intended for internal use.  While it's effective against many fungal infections with inflammation, it's not a treatment for all types of skin conditions or deep fungal infections.  Always consult a doctor to determine if this is the right treatment for your specific condition.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation (strength of terbinafine and clobetasol) prescribed by your doctor.  Generally, a thin layer of the cream is applied to the affected area twice daily, usually morning and evening.  The affected area should be thoroughly cleaned and dried before application. The duration of treatment also depends on the severity of the infection and the doctor's assessment, typically ranging from one to several weeks.  

**This medication is for external use only.**  It should not be ingested or applied to broken skin or mucous membranes.  There are no standard pediatric or adult IV formulations of this combination cream; it's exclusively topical.  Children should only use this medication under strict medical supervision.  Adjustments in dosage based on age or weight are determined by the prescribing physician.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are typically mild and can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Redness
* Itching
* Dryness
* Skin irritation

Less common, but more serious, side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
* Skin thinning
* Skin discoloration
* Stretch marks (striae)


If you experience any significant side effects, stop using the medication and consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Terbinafine, an allylamine antifungal, works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol production, terbinafine prevents the fungi from building and maintaining their cell walls, ultimately leading to their death. Clobetasol, a potent corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the body's immune response in the affected area.  Together, these two components effectively tackle both the fungal infection and the accompanying inflammatory response, promoting faster healing.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This combination cream should not be used on individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to terbinafine, clobetasol, or any of its components. It's also generally avoided on the face, groin, and underarms due to increased risk of side effects.
* **Drug Interactions:** While not extensively studied with this particular combination, interactions with other topical medications applied to the same area are possible. Inform your doctor of all medications, both topical and oral, you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of clobetasol during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered, as corticosteroids can be absorbed systemically.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to the potential for increased absorption and side effects.
* **Long-term Use:** Prolonged use of clobetasol can lead to skin thinning and other adverse effects.  Use this medication only as directed by your doctor and for the prescribed duration.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this cream on my face?** A:  Generally, no.  Use on the face is usually avoided due to the risk of increased absorption and side effects.  Consult your doctor for alternative treatments if the infection is on your face.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the cream at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Don't apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Can I stop using the cream when the symptoms improve?** A: No, continue using the medication as prescribed by your doctor even if symptoms improve to ensure the complete eradication of the fungus.  Premature discontinuation can lead to relapse.

* **Q: Is this cream suitable for all types of fungal infections?** A: No, it's specifically for fungal infections accompanied by inflammation.  Not all fungal infections require or benefit from a corticosteroid.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment.
