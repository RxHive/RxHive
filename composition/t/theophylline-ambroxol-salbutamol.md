# Theophylline + Ambroxol + Salbutamol

**Generic Name:** Theophylline + Ambroxol + Salbutamol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms of acute and chronic respiratory diseases, particularly those involving bronchospasm and excessive mucus production.  It's often prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):** Including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
* **Asthma:**  Although often used in conjunction with other asthma medications, not as a first-line treatment.
* **Acute bronchitis:** To relieve symptoms.

**Important Note:** This is a combination drug and the specific usage might depend on the dosage and formulation prescribed by a doctor.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:** The side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage, but common side effects of the individual components include:

* **Theophylline:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, insomnia, restlessness, palpitations, increased heart rate, tremors, seizures (at high doses).
* **Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, allergic reactions (skin rash, itching).
* **Salbutamol:** Tremors, palpitations, headache, muscle cramps, nervousness, insomnia.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through three different mechanisms:

* **Theophylline:**  A bronchodilator that relaxes the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe. It also has some anti-inflammatory properties.
* **Ambroxol:** A mucolytic agent that thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Salbutamol:** A short-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilator, that rapidly relaxes the muscles in the airways, providing quick relief from bronchospasm.

The combination aims to provide both quick relief from bronchospasm (Salbutamol) and longer-term symptom management by thinning mucus (Ambroxol) and providing sustained bronchodilation (Theophylline).
