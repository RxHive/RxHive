# Ticarcillin
### Generic Name
Ticarcillin

### Usage
Ticarcillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the carboxypenicillin family.  Its primary use is in treating serious infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially those resistant to other antibiotics.  This includes infections caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a bacterium known for its resistance to many common antibiotics, and indole-positive *Proteus* species. Ticarcillin is often used to treat a range of severe infections such as skin infections, septicemia (blood poisoning), peritonitis (infection of the abdominal lining), and infections of bones and joints.  It may also be used in treating urinary tract infections, both uncomplicated and complicated cases.  However, it's crucial to note that the effectiveness of ticarcillin can be reduced by beta-lactamases, enzymes produced by some bacteria that break down penicillin-type antibiotics.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

The dosage of ticarcillin varies widely depending on the severity and type of infection, and is typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). For bacterial infections, common doses range from 1 to 4 grams every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 24 grams.  For uncomplicated urinary tract infections, a lower dose (1 gram every 6 hours) may suffice. Complicated urinary tract infections often require higher doses, sometimes administered as a continuous IV infusion.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children is calculated based on weight and age. Neonates (newborns) have different dosing regimens depending on their age and weight, ranging from 75 mg/kg every 12 hours to 75 mg/kg every 6 hours. Infants, children, and adolescents usually receive 200-300 mg/kg per day, divided into doses every 4-6 hours for severe infections.  Dosage adjustments for urinary tract infections in children follow a similar pattern to adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  For renal impairment, the dose and frequency are reduced based on creatinine clearance (CrCl), a measure of kidney function.  Specific dosing guidelines for different CrCl levels and for patients undergoing dialysis are available but should be determined by a healthcare professional.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific guidance for dosage adjustments in patients with hepatic (liver) impairment; however, caution is advised.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of ticarcillin are not explicitly defined in frequency in available resources.  However, the following adverse effects have been reported:

* Fever
* Drowsiness
* Confusion
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Cholestatic hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Positive Coombs' test (indicating antibody-mediated destruction of red blood cells)
* Abnormal platelet aggregation (affecting blood clotting)
* Prolonged prothrombin time (increased bleeding risk)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Convulsions
* Myoclonus (muscle spasms)
* Acute interstitial nephritis (kidney inflammation)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) including anaphylaxis (severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (a reaction that can occur during treatment of certain bacterial infections)


Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ticarcillin works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  It achieves this by binding to penicillin-binding proteins within the bacterial cell, preventing the final steps in the construction of the cell wall. This disruption leads to bacterial cell wall instability, ultimately causing bacterial lysis (cell rupture) and death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ticarcillin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to ticarcillin, other penicillins, or any component of the formulation.
* **Interactions:** Ticarcillin can interact with several other medications, including aminoglycosides,  macrolides, tetracyclines, probenecid, methotrexate, vitamin K antagonists, and certain vaccines (BCG, cholera, typhoid). These interactions may alter the effectiveness of ticarcillin or the other drug.  Close monitoring and potential dose adjustments are necessary when using ticarcillin concurrently with these medications.
* **Warnings:** Ticarcillin should be used cautiously in patients with sodium restriction requirements (e.g., hypertension, heart failure), bleeding disorders, or a history of seizures. It may increase the risk of bleeding, kidney inflammation, superinfections (new infections developing during treatment), and hypersensitivity reactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store ticarcillin?**  A: Ticarcillin should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated.  Specific storage conditions will vary depending on the formulation.

* **Q: Can I take ticarcillin with other medications?** A: Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist before taking ticarcillin with any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements, to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is ticarcillin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Ticarcillin is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning studies in animals have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  It is excreted in breast milk; therefore, its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under the guidance of a healthcare provider.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or severe side effects while taking ticarcillin.
