# Talimogene Laherparepvec
### Generic Name
Talimogene Laherparepvec

### Usage
Talimogene laherparepvec is a type of cancer treatment called an oncolytic virus.  It's specifically used for the local treatment of unresectable (meaning it cannot be surgically removed) cutaneous (skin), subcutaneous (beneath the skin), and nodal (lymph node) lesions in patients with melanoma that has recurred after initial surgery.  It's important to understand that this treatment is for localized disease; it hasn't been shown to improve overall survival or affect visceral (internal organ) metastases (spread of cancer).

### Dosage
Talimogene laherparepvec comes in two concentrations: 10<sup>6</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL (for the first dose only) and 10<sup>8</sup> PFU per mL (for all subsequent doses).  It's administered via intralesional injection (directly into the lesion).

**Adult Dosage (Melanoma):**

* **Initial Treatment:** Up to 4 mL of the 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/mL concentration is injected. The largest lesion(s) are treated first, followed by others based on size, until the 4 mL maximum is reached or all lesions are treated.
* **Second Treatment (3 weeks later):** Up to 4 mL of the 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/mL concentration is injected.  New lesions are prioritized, then existing ones, following the same size-based approach as the initial treatment.
* **Subsequent Treatments (2 weeks apart):** Up to 4 mL of the 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/mL concentration is injected, prioritizing new lesions and then existing ones based on size.  Treatment continues for at least 6 months unless other therapy is needed or there are no more injectable lesions. Treatment can be restarted if new lesions appear.

The volume injected depends on lesion size:

* >5 cm: Up to 4 mL
* >2.5 cm to 5 cm: Up to 2 mL
* >1.5 cm to 2.5 cm: Up to 1 mL
* >0.5 cm to 1.5 cm: Up to 0.5 mL
* â‰¤0.5 cm: Up to 0.1 mL

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Talimogene laherparepvec in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works
Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically modified, live, attenuated (weakened) herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).  It's designed to replicate selectively within tumor cells, causing them to break down (tumor lysis).  It also produces human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which may stimulate an antitumor immune response by helping the body's immune system recognize and attack the cancer cells.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Immunocompromised patients (those with weakened immune systems due to conditions like HIV/AIDS, leukemia, lymphoma, or immunosuppressant medication).
* Pregnancy (Talimogene laherparepvec is a live virus and can harm the developing fetus).


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of immune-mediated events (such as glomerulonephritis, pneumonitis, vasculitis, vitiligo, and worsening psoriasis).
* Increased risk of herpetic infections (cold sores, keratitis).
* Injection-site complications (necrosis, ulceration, impaired healing).
* Use with caution in patients with multiple myeloma (risk of plasmacytoma).
* Avoid concomitant use with immunosuppressants or antineoplastic drugs (cancer drugs) due to increased risk of herpetic infection.
* Avoid concomitant use with anti-herpetic viral drugs as they may decrease the effectiveness of Talimogene laherparepvec.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Talimogene laherparepvec administered?**
    * A: It's injected directly into the melanoma lesions.

* **Q: How long does treatment last?**

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
    * A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately, especially if you experience serious side effects.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while using Talimogene laherparepvec?**
    * A: Discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor to avoid potential interactions.  Specifically, avoid immunosuppressants, antineoplastic drugs, and anti-herpetic medications.


* **Q: How is Talimogene laherparepvec stored?**
    * A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
