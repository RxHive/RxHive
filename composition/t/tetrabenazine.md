# Tetrabenazine

**Generic Name:** Tetrabenazine

**Usage:**

Tetrabenazine is a prescription medication used to treat the involuntary, jerky movements (chorea) associated with Huntington's disease.  It's also used to treat hyperkinetic movement disorders (excessive, uncontrolled movements) associated with other conditions, such as tardive dyskinesia.  It is generally used when other treatments have proven ineffective or are not tolerated well.


**Side Effects:**

Tetrabenazine can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common side effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, depression, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, constipation, weight gain, and muscle weakness.
* **Serious side effects:**  These are less common but require immediate medical attention. They include:
    * **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):**  A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle stiffness, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
    * **Depression and suicidal thoughts:** Tetrabenazine can worsen existing depression or trigger new depressive episodes, including suicidal ideation.  Close monitoring is crucial.
    * **Parkinsonism:**  Symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease, such as tremor, rigidity, and slow movement.
    * **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  A group of movement disorders, including dystonia (muscle spasms), akathisia (restlessness), and parkinsonism.
    * **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Especially when standing up quickly.
    * **Cardiac abnormalities:** Though rare.


**How it Works:**

Tetrabenazine works by depleting monoamine neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are involved in regulating movement. By reducing the levels of dopamine, tetrabenazine helps to control the involuntary movements characteristic of Huntington's disease and other hyperkinetic movement disorders.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2).


**FAQs:**

* **Is tetrabenazine addictive?**  Tetrabenazine is not considered to be addictive in the same way as opioids or stimulants. However, stopping it abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms, so it should always be tapered off under the supervision of a doctor.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking tetrabenazine?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects associated with tetrabenazine.  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly while taking this medication.

* **How long does it take to work?** The therapeutic effect of tetrabenazine may not be fully apparent for several weeks.  Regular monitoring and dose adjustments are usually needed.

* **Are there any drug interactions?** Yes, there are potential interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Who should not take tetrabenazine?** Individuals with severe depression, a history of Parkinson's disease, or those with certain heart conditions should generally avoid tetrabenazine.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should also be discussed with a physician before initiating treatment.
