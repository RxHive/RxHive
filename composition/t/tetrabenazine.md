# Tetrabenazine
### Generic Name
Tetrabenazine

### Usage
Tetrabenazine is primarily used to treat chorea, a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, jerky movements, specifically in patients with Huntington's disease.  It's a significant treatment option for managing this debilitating symptom, improving quality of life for those affected.  While not approved for other conditions, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other movement disorders.

### Dosage

**Adults (Chorea associated with Huntington's Disease):** Treatment begins with an oral dose of 12.5 mg once daily (OD) in the morning. After one week, this may be increased to 12.5 mg twice daily (BID).  Further increases of 12.5 mg/day can be made at weekly intervals, but daily doses exceeding 37.5 mg should be divided into three doses (with a maximum single dose of 25 mg).  Dosage is highly individualized, requiring careful titration.  If treatment is interrupted for more than five days, re-titration is recommended.  If interrupted for less than five days, resume at the previous maintenance dose.  The medication can be stopped without tapering, but chorea may return within 12-18 hours of the last dose. For patients needing doses above 50 mg/day, CYP2D6 genotyping is recommended to determine metabolizer status.  Maximum daily doses are 100mg for extensive/intermediate metabolizers (37.5mg/dose maximum) and 50mg for poor metabolizers (25mg/dose maximum).

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of tetrabenazine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.  No specific dosage adjustment is provided for renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (like quinidine or certain antidepressants such as fluoxetine and paroxetine) significantly increase tetrabenazine levels.  If using such inhibitors, the total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg, with a maximum single dose of 25 mg.  If toxicity or adverse reactions occur (such as akathisia, restlessness, parkinsonism, insomnia, depression, suicidality, anxiety, or excessive sedation), upward dosage titration should be stopped, the dose reduced, and discontinuation considered if the reaction persists.  Discontinuation can be done without tapering.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Sedation
* Depression
* Extrapyramidal reactions (movement disorders)
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Akathisia (restlessness)
* Anxiety
* Falls
* Nausea


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)
* Worsening of aggressive behavior
* Suicidal ideation
* QT prolongation (on ECG)
* Orthostatic hypotension
* Hyperprolactinemia

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tetrabenazine works by reversibly inhibiting the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2).  VMAT2 is responsible for transporting monoamines (neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine) into synaptic vesicles for storage and subsequent release. By inhibiting VMAT2, tetrabenazine reduces the availability of these neurotransmitters in the brain, thereby decreasing the involuntary movements associated with chorea in Huntington's disease.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to tetrabenazine or its components.
* Patients who are actively suicidal or have untreated or inadequately treated depression.
* Hepatic impairment.
* Concurrent use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (within 14 days) or reserpine (within 20 days).
* Concurrent use with deutetrabenazine or valbenazine.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of depression and suicidality:  Close monitoring for depression, suicidal thoughts, or behavioral changes is crucial.  Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in actively suicidal patients or those with untreated depression.
* Increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
* Increased risk of akathisia, restlessness, and agitation.
* Increased risk of parkinsonism.
* Increased risk of sedation and somnolence.
* Potential for QT prolongation.
* Potential for hypotension and orthostatic hypotension.
* Potential for hyperprolactinemia.
* Risk of aspiration pneumonia, particularly in patients with swallowing difficulties.
* Use caution in patients with breast cancer or other prolactin-sensitive conditions.
* Avoid alcohol consumption while taking tetrabenazine.
* Avoid tasks requiring mental alertness (e.g., driving) until the effects of the medication are known.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take tetrabenazine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible. Certain medications, especially those metabolized by CYP2D6 or those that can affect the central nervous system, may interact with tetrabenazine.
* **Q: How should I store tetrabenazine?** A: Store tetrabenazine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking tetrabenazine suddenly?** A: While you can stop taking it without tapering, it's best to discuss discontinuation with your doctor to manage any potential rebound of symptoms.
* **Q: Is tetrabenazine habit-forming?** A: Tetrabenazine is not considered a habit-forming drug.  However, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions for proper use.
