# Technetium Tc 99m Besilesomab
### Generic Name
Technetium Tc 99m Besilesomab

### Usage
Technetium Tc 99m besilesomab is a radiopharmaceutical used in scintigraphic imaging.  Its primary purpose is to help locate inflammation or infection in the peripheral bones of adults suspected of having osteomyelitis.  This is achieved by using imaging techniques to visualize the areas where the radiopharmaceutical accumulates, indicating the presence of inflammation. It's used in conjunction with other imaging methods for a more comprehensive diagnosis.  Currently, there are no established secondary uses.

### Dosage
**Scintigraphic imaging for osteomyelitis diagnosis in adults:** The intravenous (IV) dose ranges from 0.25 to 1 mg (400-800 MBq).  There is no established dosage for pediatric patients.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects
* **Common (>10%):** Development of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Hypotension.
* **Rare (<1%):** Myalgia, arthralgia, hypersensitivity reactions, and anaphylactic reactions.

**Important:**  Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Besilesomab, the main component, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to NCA-95, an antigen found on the surface of granulocytes (a type of white blood cell).  Granulocytes accumulate in areas of inflammation and infection.  Technetium-99m, a radioactive isotope, is attached to besilesomab. The accumulation of the radiolabeled besilesomab in inflamed bone tissue allows for visualization during scintigraphic imaging, indicating the site of osteomyelitis.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**
* Hypersensitivity to Technetium Tc 99m besilesomab, other murine antibodies, or any excipients (such as sorbitol).
* Positive screening test for human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA).
* Pregnancy.

**Warnings and Precautions:**
* There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions.
* Patients should be adequately hydrated before and after the scan to aid in the excretion of the radioactive material and improve image quality.
* The use of this medication should only occur once in a patient’s lifetime.
* Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not use this product (due to the presence of sorbitol).
* False results are possible in patients with neutrophil defects or hematological malignancies.
* Close contact with infants and pregnant women should be limited for 12 hours post-injection.
* Technetium Tc 99m besilesomab imaging cannot distinguish between infection and inflammation. It's not suitable for diagnosing diabetic foot infections.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Technetium Tc 99m besilesomab administered?** A: It's administered intravenously as a single dose.
* **Q: How long does the procedure take?** A: The administration is relatively quick, but imaging and interpretation will take longer, depending on the facility’s workflow.
* **Q: Are there any special precautions after the scan?** A: Drink plenty of fluids to help flush the radioactive material from your system.  Limit close contact with infants and pregnant women for 12 hours.
* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects, especially those listed above.
* **Q: How is Technetium Tc 99m besilesomab stored?** A:  This medication requires specific handling and storage, as it is a radioactive substance. Follow the instructions provided by the healthcare professional or facility concerning storage and disposal.
