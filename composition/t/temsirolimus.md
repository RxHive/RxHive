# Temsirolimus
### Generic Name
Temsirolimus

### Usage
Temsirolimus is primarily used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer.  It's a targeted therapy, meaning it focuses on specific cells involved in cancer growth, rather than affecting the entire body like chemotherapy.  Currently, it's not approved for other cancer types.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults with advanced RCC is 25 mg administered intravenously once a week.  This infusion should be given over 30-60 minutes.  Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  A prophylactic dose of an antihistamine like diphenhydramine (25-50mg) is usually given about 30 minutes before Temsirolimus to help prevent allergic reactions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dose may need adjustment in patients with mild hepatic (liver) impairment.  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication (meaning Temsirolimus shouldn't be used).  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for renal (kidney) impairment.  Dose modifications may also be necessary if the patient is taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (certain other medications); consult a healthcare professional for guidance on this.  Temsirolimus is not currently approved for use in children, therefore pediatric dosing information is unavailable.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Pain
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Edema (swelling)
* Chest pain
* Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes)
* Nausea
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Taste changes (dysgeusia)
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Vomiting
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Cough
* Nosebleeds (epistaxis)
* Sore throat (pharyngitis)
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Nail problems
* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* Increased blood sugar
* Increased cholesterol
* High triglycerides
* Low phosphate
* Low potassium
* Weight loss
* Decreased hemoglobin
* Low white blood cell count
* Low platelet count
* Increased liver enzymes (AST, ALP)
* Urinary tract infection
* Weakness
* Back pain
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Increased creatinine levels
* Infections (various types)
* Fever

Less common but serious side effects include:  high blood pressure, blood clots, pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart),  pneumonitis (lung inflammation),  bowel perforation,  Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction), acute renal failure, and others.  It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Temsirolimus works by binding to a protein called FKBP-12. This combination then inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a kinase enzyme that plays a crucial role in cell growth and the development of blood vessels (angiogenesis) in tumors. By blocking mTOR, Temsirolimus slows down the growth of cancer cells and reduces the formation of new blood vessels that supply tumors. This ultimately helps shrink the tumor and potentially improves the patient's condition.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Temsirolimus is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin levels >1.5 times the upper limit of normal) and those with a history of allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to Temsirolimus, sirolimus, or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Temsirolimus can interact with other medications, especially those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system.  Consult your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Grapefruit juice should be avoided as it can affect Temsirolimus levels.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Temsirolimus is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during and for 3 weeks after Temsirolimus treatment.
* **Other Precautions:** Monitor for signs of bone marrow suppression, infections, allergic reactions, lung problems, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia.  Patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperlipidemia should be carefully monitored.  Be aware that Temsirolimus can impair wound healing.
