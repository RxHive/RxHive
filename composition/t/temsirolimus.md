# Temsirolimus

**Generic Name:** Temsirolimus

**Usage:**

Temsirolimus is an antineoplastic (anticancer) medication used in the treatment of specific types of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma, or RCC) and certain types of  lymphoma.  Specifically:

* **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):** It's used for advanced RCC that has progressed after treatment with interferon-alpha.  It may be used alone or in combination with other therapies.
* **Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL):**  It is used in treatment of  relapsed or refractory PTCL.


**Side Effects:**

Temsirolimus can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others more serious.  The severity and frequency of side effects vary from person to person.  Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling very tired or weak.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Feeling sick to your stomach and throwing up.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Decreased appetite:** Loss of interest in eating.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or redness.
* **Mouth sores (stomatitis):** Painful sores in the mouth.
* **Increased risk of infection:** Weakened immune system.

* **Heart problems:** Irregular heartbeat, heart failure.

**How it Works:**

Temsirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.  mTOR is a protein that plays a critical role in cell growth, proliferation, and survival.  By inhibiting mTOR, temsirolimus disrupts these processes, leading to the slowing or stopping of cancer cell growth.  It specifically targets cancer cells that are dependent on mTOR signaling for growth and survival.


**FAQs:**

* **Q:  How is Temsirolimus administered?**  A: It's typically given intravenously (IV) over a period of 30 minutes to 1 hour. The frequency of administration is determined by the doctor based on the patient's condition and response to treatment.
