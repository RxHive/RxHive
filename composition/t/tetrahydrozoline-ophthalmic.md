# Tetrahydrozoline (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Tetrahydrozoline (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Tetrahydrozoline ophthalmic solution is primarily used to relieve redness in the eyes caused by minor irritations.  It's also effective in providing temporary relief from burning and discomfort associated with dry eyes or exposure to wind and sun.  It acts as a decongestant, reducing the redness by constricting blood vessels in the eye's surface.  The medication is intended for short-term use only, addressing temporary eye irritation, not underlying medical conditions.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children 6 years and older:** For ophthalmic use, 1-2 drops of a 0.05% solution should be instilled into the affected eye(s) up to four times daily.  Treatment should not exceed 72 hours.  This dosage information applies to both adults and children aged 6 years and older.  There is no dosage adjustment information provided for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes (usually transient)
* Blurred vision


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, include:

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Tremor

If any adverse effects occur, or if symptoms worsen or persist beyond 72 hours, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Tetrahydrozoline ophthalmic solution works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the small blood vessels (arterioles) of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye). This stimulation causes vasoconstriction, meaning the blood vessels narrow.  This narrowing reduces blood flow to the surface of the eye, leading to a decrease in redness and associated discomfort.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Tetrahydrozoline ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetrahydrozoline or any other component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of temporary pupil dilation (mydriasis).
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension and coronary artery disease), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or narrow-angle glaucoma.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should use only if clearly needed and should consult their healthcare provider.  Accidental ingestion by children can be serious; seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently reported.
