# Tegafur + Uracil
### Generic Name
Tegafur + Uracil

### Usage
Tegafur and Uracil, often referred to as UFT, is a combination chemotherapy drug primarily used as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.  It's typically administered in conjunction with leucovorin calcium.  Beyond colorectal cancer, UFT also sees use in treating several other advanced cancers, including breast, bladder, gastric, head and neck, hepatobiliary (gallbladder or bile duct), hepatocellular, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and uterine/cervical cancers.  However, its effectiveness varies across these cancers, and it's often employed in later-line treatment settings for many of them.  The specific use and efficacy should always be determined in consultation with an oncologist.


### Dosage
Dosage for Tegafur + Uracil is complex and highly individualized, depending on the type of cancer being treated, the patient's body surface area (BSA), and response to therapy.  There is no standardized pediatric dosage as safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

**Adult Dosage (examples, not exhaustive):**

* **Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (with leucovorin calcium):**  A common regimen involves 300 mg/m²/day of Tegafur and 672 mg/m²/day of Uracil, divided into three doses daily (every 8 hours) for 28 days, followed by a 7-day rest period.  The cycle then repeats.  Dosage may also be determined by BSA using capsule counts (e.g., 3-6 capsules per day based on BSA,  with specific counts for each BSA range).  Always follow the oncologist's precise prescription.

* **Other Cancers:**  Dosages for other cancers generally range from 300-600 mg/day of Tegafur (the active component), divided into 2-3 doses. Specific dosages vary widely depending on the individual's response and tolerance to the treatment.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on patient response and side effects.  Reductions are common if severe side effects like neutropenia or other toxicities develop.  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling; however, close monitoring is crucial in these cases.  Guidelines exist for adjusting dosage in obese patients, often using actual body weight for BSA calculations.  Consult with a medical professional for appropriate adjustments.


### Side Effects
Tegafur + Uracil can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity and frequency.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea and vomiting
* Anorexia
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin)
* Weakness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe neutropenia (increasing risk of infection)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count, increasing risk of bleeding)
* Severe gastrointestinal toxicity (e.g., colitis, intestinal perforation)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including potentially fatal fulminant hepatitis
* Cardiotoxicity (heart damage)
* Neurological effects (e.g., neuropathy, confusion)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare professional.


### How it Works
Tegafur is a prodrug, meaning it's inactive until it's metabolized in the body.  It's converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a well-known anticancer drug that interferes with DNA synthesis and cell replication, ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.  Uracil works by inhibiting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), an enzyme that breaks down 5-FU.  By inhibiting DPD, Uracil increases the levels of active 5-FU, leading to enhanced anti-tumor activity.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Tegafur + Uracil is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the components, pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, individuals with severe bone marrow suppression, severe hepatic impairment, severe diarrhea, severe infection, known hepatic CYP2A6 deficiency, or known or suspected DPD deficiency.  It should also be avoided with concurrent use of certain other medications (see interactions below).

* **Drug Interactions:** This combination interacts significantly with several other drugs, including leflunomide, phenytoin, warfarin, colony-stimulating factors, tamoxifen, folic acid, and sorivudine.  Concurrent use can increase the risk of severe or fatal toxicity.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting treatment.

* **Warnings:**  This combination can cause severe bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, cardiotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity.  Patients with pre-existing heart conditions or bowel issues should be monitored closely.  Close monitoring for signs of toxicity is crucial throughout treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The response to Tegafur + Uracil varies greatly between individuals.  It might take several weeks or months to see a noticeable effect on tumor size or symptoms.

* **Q: How is this medication stored?** A: Store the medication according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking this medication?** A:  Some patients experience side effects such as dizziness or drowsiness that might impair driving ability.  Follow your doctor's advice.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not make up for missed doses. Contact your healthcare provider for guidance.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects can include irreversible infertility.  Discuss concerns about long-term effects with your healthcare provider.
