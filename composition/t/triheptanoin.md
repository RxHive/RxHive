# Triheptanoin
### Generic Name
Triheptanoin

### Usage

Triheptanoin is a medication used to provide calories and fatty acids to individuals with confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LCFAODs).  LCFAODs are genetic conditions where the body struggles to break down long-chain fatty acids for energy. Triheptanoin bypasses the faulty metabolic pathways by providing medium-chain triglycerides (specifically, triheptanoin, which contains three heptanoate molecules), which the body can more easily process for energy production. This helps to prevent the serious complications associated with LCFAODs, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), and liver dysfunction.  The primary use is as a supplemental calorie and fatty acid source in patients with LCFAOD.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's daily caloric needs (DCI), which must be determined by a healthcare professional before starting Triheptanoin. The goal is to replace a portion of the patient's caloric intake (up to 35%) with Triheptanoin.

**Adults and Children:** The dosage is calculated as follows:

Total daily dose (mL) = (Patient's DCI [kcal] x desired % of DCI) / 8.3 kcal/mL

* **Starting Dose:** For patients not already on a medium-chain triglyceride product, initiate treatment at approximately 10% of the patient's DCI, divided into at least four doses per day. For patients switching from another MCT product, begin at the highest previously tolerated dose, divided into at least four doses.

* **Dose Titration:** Increase the daily dose by approximately 5% of the DCI every 2-3 days until the target dose (up to 35% of DCI) is reached.

* **GI Intolerance:** If gastrointestinal side effects (see below) occur, reduce the dose until symptoms subside, then gradually increase as tolerated.

* **Administration:** Triheptanoin should be mixed with semi-solid foods or liquids (yogurt, milk, cereal, pudding, applesauce, smoothies) before administration to improve palatability and reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal upset.  It should be given with meals or snacks.  For patients receiving Triheptanoin via a feeding tube, follow specific instructions provided by the healthcare professional.  Always use compatible materials (avoid polystyrene or PVC).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Abdominal pain (including distention, distress, and upper abdominal pain)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting

**Less Common, But Serious Side Effects:** While less frequent, some patients may experience more serious side effects.  It is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any concerning symptoms develop.


### How it Works

Triheptanoin provides medium-chain fatty acids (heptanoate) that bypass the metabolic defects seen in LCFAODs. The body can readily metabolize these medium-chain fatty acids for energy, supplementing the deficient pathways and reducing the accumulation of harmful substances that would otherwise result from the inability to properly process long-chain fatty acids.


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Triheptanoin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Triheptanoin or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with orlistat should be avoided as orlistat may reduce the effectiveness of Triheptanoin.
* **Pancreatic Insufficiency:** Triheptanoin may not be fully absorbed in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** There is limited data on the use of Triheptanoin during pregnancy and lactation.  A healthcare provider should weigh the risks and benefits of using Triheptanoin during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, close monitoring is advised.
* **Monitoring:** Patients should be monitored for gastrointestinal tolerance and signs of pancreatic insufficiency.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Triheptanoin suddenly?**  A: No, always follow your doctor's instructions regarding discontinuation.  Stopping suddenly could potentially lead to a worsening of your condition.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but if it is nearing the time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store Triheptanoin?** A: Store Triheptanoin as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from heat and light.
* **Q: Is Triheptanoin suitable for infants?** A: Yes, but dosage must be carefully calculated and adjusted by a healthcare provider to meet the infant's individual needs.  Triheptanoin use in infants should be closely monitored.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Triheptanoin?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known. Ongoing monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential for patients taking Triheptanoin long-term.
