# Taurolidine
### Generic Name
Taurolidine

### Usage
Taurolidine is a synthetic antimicrobial agent primarily used as an irrigating solution to prevent and treat infections. Its main applications include:

* **Peritonitis:** Infection of the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity). Taurolidine helps reduce the bacterial load and inflammation associated with this serious condition.
* **Bone and soft tissue infections:**  It's used to irrigate infected surgical sites in bones and soft tissues to combat infection and promote healing.
* **Pleural cavity abscess:** Infections within the pleural cavity (the space surrounding the lungs) can be treated with Taurolidine irrigation to reduce bacterial contamination and encourage resolution of the abscess.

While primarily used for these purposes, Taurolidine's role might extend to adjunct therapy in certain surgical procedures where infection risk is high.  Always consult a medical professional to determine its suitability for a specific case.

### Dosage

Taurolidine dosage varies considerably depending on the specific condition and administration method.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.  The following information provides a general overview and should not substitute professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Bone and soft tissue infection:** Irrigation of the surgical site is typically performed using a 0.5% diluted solution of Taurolidine. The exact volume will depend on the size and extent of the infection.

* **Peritonitis (adjunctive therapy):**  For peritoneal lavage, a 2% solution is diluted to 0.5% before use. A single instillation might involve 200mL, while repeated instillations (up to 5 days post-surgery) could use 300mL initially, followed by 100mL daily.  The drainage tube is typically clamped for two hours post-instillation to allow sufficient contact time.

* **Pleural cavity abscess:**  After surgery, 100mL of a 2% solution is usually instilled twice daily via a drainage tube, kept in place for 1-2 hours before drainage.

**Children:**

Dosage for children older than 10 years is generally the same as for adults in cases of peritonitis, but only under close medical supervision.  Pediatric dosages for other uses are not explicitly detailed and need to be determined by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with kidney problems.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Flushing
* Pain or irritation at the injection site (usually temporary)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) are possible, though less frequent.

More serious side effects, while less common, can include changes in blood pressure and heart rate, especially during intra-operative administration with lighter anesthesia, and metabolic acidosis.  Seek immediate medical attention if any severe or concerning side effects occur.

### How it Works

Taurolidine's antimicrobial action is multifaceted. It disrupts bacterial cell walls, leading to cell lysis (breakdown) and cross-linking of molecules within the bacteria. This process neutralizes bacterial endotoxins (harmful substances released by bacteria), which is further enhanced by enzymatic activation within the body. In addition to its antimicrobial effects, Taurolidine also inhibits the formation of post-operative peritoneal adhesions (scar tissue formation within the abdominal cavity).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Taurolidine should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Taurolidine or any of its components.  It's also contraindicated for concurrent use with oxidizing agents such as Dakin's solution, povidone-iodine, and hydrogen peroxide.

* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of changes in blood pressure and heart rate, particularly during surgery with light anesthesia. Metabolic acidosis (a condition of excessive acidity in the body) can also be a concern.

* **Use with Caution:** Patients with impaired renal function require careful monitoring during Taurolidine therapy.


* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of Taurolidine during pregnancy and lactation haven't been established. Its use should be strictly limited to situations where the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Breast milk excretion is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can Taurolidine be used at home?** A: No. Taurolidine is administered in a clinical setting by healthcare professionals, typically during or after surgery.

* **Q: How is Taurolidine stored?** A:  Storage guidelines should be obtained from the product's packaging or a healthcare professional.  Generally, medications should be stored as directed to maintain efficacy and safety.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Since Taurolidine administration is usually part of a controlled medical procedure, missed doses should be addressed by contacting the prescribing healthcare provider.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A:  The primary interaction to avoid is with oxidizing agents. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially severe ones, to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.
