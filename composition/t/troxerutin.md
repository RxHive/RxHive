# Troxerutin
### Generic Name
Troxerutin

### Usage
Troxerutin is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and hemorrhoids.  CVI refers to inadequate blood flow in the veins, often leading to leg swelling, pain, and discomfort.  Troxerutin helps improve capillary function and reduce inflammation in these conditions. While not a cure, it aims to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life for those affected.  It's important to note that troxerutin treats symptoms, not the underlying cause of CVI or hemorrhoids.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the form of the medication (oral or topical).

**Adults:**

* **Oral:** The typical daily dose ranges from 600 to 1200 mg, usually divided into multiple administrations.  Specific instructions will be provided by a healthcare professional.
* **Topical (Gel, typically 2%):**  Apply a thin layer to the affected area, usually from the bottom (distal) upwards (proximal).  Rub gently until absorbed.  Applications should be spaced at least 10-12 hours apart.  The exact amount and frequency depend on individual needs and physician recommendations.

**Children:**
The safety and efficacy of troxerutin in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically directed by a physician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Headache
* Flushing (redness of the skin)
* Itching
* Rashes
* Heartburn (esophageal burning)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)


Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Troxerutin is a bioflavonoid with antioxidant properties.  It works by improving the function of capillaries (the smallest blood vessels).  This improvement reduces abnormal leakage of fluid from capillaries, lessening swelling and inflammation. In the context of CVI and hemorrhoids, this action helps to reduce symptoms such as pain, swelling, and discomfort.


### Precautions
* **Allergy:** Troxerutin should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to troxerutin or any components of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Troxerutin is potentially harmful to the fetus, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy.  It's generally advised to avoid use during pregnancy.  The excretion of troxerutin in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** Currently, there is no specific dosage adjustment recommendation for patients with liver or kidney impairment. Consult a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:** While not extensively documented, potential interactions with other medications are possible. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
