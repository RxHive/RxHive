# Teduglutide
### Generic Name
Teduglutide

### Usage
Teduglutide is primarily used to treat short bowel syndrome (SBS) in adults and children aged 1 year and older who require parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding).  SBS is a condition where a significant portion of the small intestine is missing or non-functional, leading to an inability to absorb sufficient nutrients.  Teduglutide helps improve nutrient absorption, reducing the need for intravenous feeding.  While its primary use is in SBS, it's important to note that this medication is only prescribed by a doctor who has comprehensively evaluated a patient's condition and determined that this treatment is appropriate.

### Dosage

**Adults with Short Bowel Syndrome (requiring parenteral support):** The usual dosage is 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily.

**Children (≥1 year, weighing ≥10 kg) with Short Bowel Syndrome (requiring parenteral support):** The usual dosage is 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily.  Note:  Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children under 1 year or weighing less than 10 kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the dose should be reduced to 0.025 mg/kg once daily.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically needed.  However, those with severe impairment require close monitoring.  Specific dosage adjustments for severe hepatic impairment are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling and require close consultation with a healthcare professional.

**Administration:** Teduglutide is administered subcutaneously.  After proper training, adults can self-administer the injection.  Rotating injection sites (thighs, upper arms, abdomen) is recommended.

If any adverse effects occur, it’s crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Teduglutide is a synthetic analog of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a naturally occurring intestinal hormone.  GLP-2 plays a vital role in maintaining the health and function of the intestines. Teduglutide mimics the actions of GLP-2 by binding to its receptors in the intestines. This binding stimulates several processes that improve intestinal function:  increased blood flow to the intestines, improved nutrient absorption, and reduced intestinal fluid loss.  It also promotes growth and healing of the intestinal lining.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Teduglutide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components, active gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies (including hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers), and patients with a history of GI malignancies within the past 5 years.

* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of developing colorectal polyps, fluid overload/congestive heart failure, gallbladder/biliary tract disease, intestinal obstruction, acceleration of neoplastic growth, and pancreatitis.  Close monitoring is required, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or renal impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with drugs having a narrow therapeutic index (where small changes in blood levels can be significant) or phenothiazines or benzodiazepines may lead to increased absorption and potentially harmful effects.  Concomitant use should be carefully considered or avoided if possible.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Teduglutide is classified as a Category B drug during pregnancy, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking. Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the infant.

* **Children and Older Adults:**  Close monitoring is crucial in both pediatric and geriatric populations, given potential variations in response and higher sensitivity to side effects.  Specific guidelines for children under one year of age are not established.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Teduglutide?**  A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on individual responses and the severity of the SBS.  Some individuals may notice benefits within weeks, while others may require longer treatment.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Teduglutide suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Teduglutide can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.  Dosage reduction and close medical supervision are usually required when discontinuing treatment.

* **Q: How should I store Teduglutide?** A: Store Teduglutide in the refrigerator, protected from light. Do not freeze.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never take two doses on the same day.

* **Q: Is Teduglutide safe for long-term use?**  A: Long-term use of Teduglutide requires regular monitoring due to the potential for long-term side effects, particularly those related to the GI tract.  Your physician will assess the risks and benefits over the long-term.  It's crucial to be compliant with regular monitoring of blood work and scheduled colonoscopies as directed.
