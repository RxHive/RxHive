# Turpentine Oil
### Generic Name
Turpentine Oil

### Usage
Turpentine oil is a fluid derived from the distillation of resin from certain pine trees. Historically, it has been used topically as a rubefacient – meaning it causes irritation to the skin, leading to increased blood flow – to potentially alleviate pain associated with joint pain, muscle aches, nerve pain, and toothaches.  It was also used in some preparations for respiratory tract disorders.  However, it's important to note that current medical consensus deems turpentine oil neither safe nor effective for any medical purpose, and it is no longer commercially available for medicinal use.

### Dosage
Because turpentine oil is not currently considered safe or effective for medicinal use and is not commercially available for medical purposes, there are no established dosage recommendations.  Any previous usage guidelines are now considered obsolete and potentially dangerous.

### Side Effects
Given that turpentine oil is no longer used medically, detailed side effect information is primarily based on historical reports which must be viewed with caution due to lack of modern, controlled studies.  Reported potential side effects could include:

* Skin irritation and allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe allergic contact dermatitis)
* Respiratory irritation (coughing, shortness of breath, especially with inhalation)
* Digestive upset (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) if ingested
* Neurological effects (headache, dizziness, confusion) in rare cases, possibly due to absorption through the skin.

**Serious side effects are possible, and any use of turpentine oil is strongly discouraged.**  If any adverse reaction occurs, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
The purported mechanism of action for topical use was based on its rubefacient properties.  The irritation caused by turpentine oil on the skin would increase blood flow to the area, potentially providing temporary relief from underlying pain through a counter-irritant effect.  Its historical use in respiratory preparations was believed to stem from its volatile nature, potentially loosening congestion.  However, these mechanisms lack robust scientific evidence and are not supported by modern medical understanding.

### Precautions
**Turpentine oil should not be used for any medical purpose.** Its historical uses are now considered unsafe and ineffective.  There are numerous risks associated with its use, including skin irritation, allergic reactions, respiratory problems, and potential for systemic effects if absorbed.  It should never be ingested.  Pregnant women, children, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory or skin conditions are particularly vulnerable to potential harm.

### FAQs

**Q: Is turpentine oil still available for medicinal use?**
A: No.  Current medical consensus considers turpentine oil unsafe and ineffective for medicinal purposes, and it is no longer commercially available for such use.
