# Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
### Generic Name
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

### Usage

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is primarily used to treat HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.  It's a crucial part of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, significantly reducing the viral load and improving the CD4+ T-cell count in infected individuals.  This leads to improved immune function and a better quality of life.  For chronic HBV, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate helps to suppress viral replication, preventing liver damage and improving liver function tests.  It's important to understand that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate doesn't cure either HIV or HBV; it manages these infections long-term.  Discontinuation of treatment can lead to a resurgence of the virus.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.  General guidelines are provided below, but **these are not a substitute for professional medical advice.**

* **HIV Infection (Oral):** The typical adult dose is one 300 mg tablet once daily.  Dosage adjustments are frequently needed for those with kidney impairment.

* **Chronic Hepatitis B (Oral):**  The usual adult dose is one 300 mg tablet once daily.  Again, dosage modification is essential for individuals with kidney problems.

* **Pediatric Use (Oral):**  Dosage for children depends on weight and age and must be determined by a physician. Liquid formulations are often available for children.

* **IV Administration:**  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not typically administered intravenously.  A related compound, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), is available in IV formulations for certain circumstances.  This should only be administered under strict medical supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dizziness

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Kidney problems (including acute kidney injury) – this is more likely in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those taking other nephrotoxic medications.
* Changes in bone mineral density
* Lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the blood) – a rare but serious condition.
* Liver problems (in patients with HBV)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).  It works by interfering with the action of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme vital for HIV and HBV to replicate.  By blocking reverse transcriptase, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate prevents the viruses from making copies of themselves, reducing their levels in the body and thereby slowing disease progression.

### Precautions

* **Kidney Disease:** Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can affect kidney function.  Individuals with pre-existing kidney disease or those taking other medications that can harm the kidneys need close monitoring.

* **Bone Health:**  Long-term use can sometimes affect bone mineral density.  Regular monitoring may be recommended.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can interact with other medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing side effects.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but careful consideration of the risks and benefits is crucial.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to kidney-related side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate if I feel better?**  A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to a resurgence of the virus and potentially more severe consequences.  Continue taking it as prescribed even if you feel well.

* **Q: How should I store tenofovir disoproxil fumarate?**  A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions while taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate?**  A: Generally, no specific dietary restrictions are necessary, but maintaining a healthy diet is always advisable.

* **Q: Is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate addictive?**  A: No, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not considered an addictive substance.
