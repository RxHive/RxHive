# Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime
### Generic Name
Technetium Tc 99m Exametazime

### Usage
Technetium Tc 99m exametazime is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily in diagnostic imaging. Its main applications are:

* **Detecting altered regional cerebral perfusion:** This is crucial in diagnosing strokes and other cerebrovascular diseases. The medication helps visualize blood flow in the brain, identifying areas with reduced or absent perfusion.  This is achieved through planar or SPECT imaging techniques.

* **Leukocyte labeling in scintigraphy:**  Technetium Tc 99m exametazime can label white blood cells (leukocytes).  This labeled leukocyte scintigraphy is used to detect and localize infections and inflammatory processes, particularly in the abdomen (intra-abdominal infections) and in inflammatory bowel disease.  Imaging can be dynamic (monitoring changes over time) or static (capturing images at specific points).

While the primary uses are noted above, off-label uses may also exist under the guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use (cerebral perfusion imaging or leukocyte labeling), the patient's weight (especially in children), and the imaging technique employed.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions and the specific product labeling for accurate dosage and administration.  The information below provides general guidance only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Cerebral Perfusion Imaging (Stroke):**  Typically 15-30 mCi (555-1110 MBq) intravenously (IV) for a 70kg patient. Imaging is typically performed 30-90 minutes post-administration, with the entire procedure completed within 4 hours.

* **Leukocyte-Labeled Scintigraphy (Intra-abdominal Infection/Inflammatory Bowel Disease):**  Usually 5-10 mCi (185-370 MBq) IV. Imaging may be dynamic (first 60 minutes), or static (at various times, from 30 minutes to 24 hours post-administration, depending on the clinical question).

**Children (aged â‰¥2 years):**

* **Cerebral Perfusion Imaging (Stroke):** 0.4 mCi/kg (14 MBq/kg) IV, with a minimum dose of 3 mCi (110 MBq) and a maximum dose not exceeding the adult maximum.  Imaging follows the same timeline as in adults.

* **Leukocyte-Labeled Scintigraphy (Intra-abdominal Infection/Inflammatory Bowel Disease):** 0.2 mCi/kg (7.4 MBq/kg) IV, with a minimum dose of 2 mCi (74 MBq) and a maximum not exceeding the adult maximum. Imaging follows the same principles as in adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment.  For renal impairment, while no specific adjustments are given, dose reduction may be considered due to the medication's renal excretion.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosage in patients with impaired organ function.

### Side Effects

The frequency of side effects is not consistently defined in available literature. However, reported side effects may include:

* Facial edema
* Transient hypertension
* Erythema (redness of the skin)
* Skin rash
* Fever


While serious side effects are uncommon, any unexpected or concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Technetium Tc 99m exametazime is a radiotracer. After intravenous administration, it's primarily extracted and trapped by the grey matter of the brain and the basal ganglia during its initial passage through the brain's circulatory system.  This retention occurs because the initial complex is converted into a less lipophilic (fat-soluble) form, preventing it from easily crossing the blood-brain barrier. This allows for visualization of brain perfusion on scans.

In leukocyte labeling, the technetium binds to white blood cells, allowing for the tracking of these cells to areas of infection or inflammation within the body.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of the medication should use caution.

* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment due to the potential for increased toxicity.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Technetium Tc 99m exametazime is classified as Category C in pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is unknown.  It's excreted in breast milk;  breastfeeding should be interrupted for 12-24 hours after administration (depending on the dose), or delayed until breastfeeding ceases. Consult with a physician regarding risks and benefits before administration during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

* **Radiation Exposure:**  This is a radioactive medication. Appropriate radiation safety measures must be observed during preparation, administration, and imaging.  Patients should be well-hydrated and encouraged to void frequently to minimize radiation exposure to the kidneys and bladder.

* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions are not extensively documented, it's crucial to inform the physician of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) being taken before administration.


### FAQs

* **How is Technetium Tc 99m exametazime stored?**  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for specific storage conditions.  Generally, it requires storage at controlled room temperature.

* **How long does it take to see results?**  The timing depends on the type of imaging. For cerebral perfusion imaging, results are available within a few hours of injection. For leukocyte labeling, results may be available after a few hours to up to 24 hours, depending on the technique and clinical question.

* **Is Technetium Tc 99m exametazime safe?**  Like all medications, there are potential risks and side effects.  The benefits should outweigh the risks as determined by a qualified physician. Proper administration, adherence to dosage recommendations, and appropriate radiation safety measures are crucial.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Report any unexpected or concerning side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.
