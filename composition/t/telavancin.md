# Telavancin
### Generic Name
Telavancin

### Usage

Telavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections. Its primary use is for complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI).  It's also approved for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*.  While not officially labeled for this purpose, it's sometimes used off-label to treat *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteremia (blood infection).  It's important to note that telavancin should only be used when other antibiotics are ineffective or unsuitable.

### Dosage

Telavancin is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage is typically determined by body weight and renal function.

**Adults:**  The standard dose for cSSSI and HABP/VABP caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* is 10 mg/kg infused over one hour once daily for 7-14 days (cSSSI) or 7-21 days (HABP/VABP).  The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and clinical response.

**Dosage Adjustments based on Renal Function:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (reduced creatinine clearance, CrCl).  Consult prescribing information for specific recommendations, as these vary depending on the CrCl level.  Generally, lower doses and less frequent administrations are used for those with reduced CrCl. Treatment is typically not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of telavancin in children have not been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Metallic taste
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Increased serum creatinine levels (a marker of kidney function)
* Foamy urine


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in <10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Infusion-site pain
* Rigors (shaking chills)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Decreased appetite
* Abdominal pain
* Infusion-site reactions
* Renal insufficiency or acute kidney failure
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (a serious intestinal infection)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Prolonged QT interval (on electrocardiogram – ECG – potentially leading to abnormal heart rhythms)


**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Telavancin is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It works primarily by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. This prevents bacteria from building and maintaining their protective outer layer, ultimately leading to their destruction.  It also disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, further contributing to bacterial death.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Telavancin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to telavancin or any components of its formulation.  Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of vancomycin allergy.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Telavancin can cause or worsen kidney problems.  Renal function should be closely monitored, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease. Dosage adjustments are often needed.
* **Pregnancy:**  Telavancin is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning that it poses potential risks to the developing fetus.  Pregnancy testing is recommended before starting treatment.  Effective contraception should be used during treatment and for two days after the last dose.
* **QT Prolongation:** Telavancin can prolong the QT interval on an ECG. This can increase the risk of life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances. Caution is advised in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome, uncompensated heart failure).
* **Drug Interactions:** Telavancin may interact with other medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal products you are taking.
* **Superinfections:**  Like other antibiotics, telavancin can increase the risk of fungal or bacterial superinfections.



### FAQs
