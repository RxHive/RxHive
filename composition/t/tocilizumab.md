# Tocilizumab
### Generic Name
Tocilizumab

### Usage
Tocilizumab is a medication used to treat several inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.  Its primary use is in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic condition causing joint pain and inflammation. It's also approved for treating giant-cell arteritis (GCA), a serious condition affecting the arteries, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), a severe form of arthritis in children.  Importantly, Tocilizumab is being investigated for use in severely ill patients with COVID-19, though its effectiveness and safety in this context haven't been fully established.  It's crucial to understand that Tocilizumab is a powerful medication and is used only when other treatments have proven insufficient.

### Dosage
Tocilizumab dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's weight and age, and the administration method (intravenous [IV] infusion or subcutaneous [SubQ] injection).  Dosage information below is for guidance only, and should not substitute advice from a healthcare professional.  Always follow your doctor's precise instructions.

**Adults:**

* **COVID-19 (off-label):**  The safety and efficacy haven't been established.  Typically, an 8 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes is used, with a potential repeat dose after 12-24 hours if needed.  Strict monitoring for infections and low white blood cell counts is necessary.
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**  Initial IV doses usually range from 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg once every four weeks, often combined with other medications.  Subcutaneous administration uses a different dosage regimen (162 mg every other week or weekly, depending on weight and response).
* **Giant-Cell Arteritis (GCA):** Typically administered subcutaneously at 162 mg once weekly, combined with corticosteroids, gradually reducing the corticosteroid dose over time.
* **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** The dose varies based on weight and the cause of the CRS, typically administered as an IV infusion.

**Children:**  Dosage for children depends heavily on the specific condition (SJIA or polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [PJIA]), age, and weight.  IV and SubQ routes are both used, with dosage adjustments based on weight and response.  It's vital to consult a pediatrician specializing in rheumatology for accurate dosage information.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Increased cholesterol levels
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT and AST)
* Injection site reactions (SubQ)
* Infusion-related reactions (IV)
* High blood pressure
* Swelling in the extremities
* Skin rash
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Nausea


Less common but serious side effects include serious infections (bacterial, fungal, viral, or opportunistic), neutropenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and allergic reactions.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Tocilizumab works by blocking the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. IL-6 is a protein involved in inflammation and immune responses.  By inhibiting IL-6, Tocilizumab reduces inflammation and helps manage the symptoms of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.  This mechanism of action contributes to the alleviation of joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.

### Precautions
* **Infections:** Tocilizumab weakens the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.  Patients should be monitored closely for signs of infection.  Latent tuberculosis should be ruled out before starting treatment.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.  Discontinue the medication immediately and seek medical help if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Liver Function:** Tocilizumab can affect liver function; regular liver tests are necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Tocilizumab is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  It's best to avoid use during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary. It is unknown whether it passes into breast milk.
* **Interactions:** Tocilizumab can interact with other medications, particularly those affecting the immune system or liver.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.  Live vaccines should be avoided during treatment.
* **Other Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with certain pre-existing conditions like gastrointestinal issues or liver disease.

### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of effects varies depending on the condition and individual response.  Benefits may not be fully apparent for several weeks.
* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: No.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for stopping Tocilizumab.  Sudden cessation can potentially worsen symptoms.
* **Q: How is it stored?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the formulation (IV or SubQ).  Always follow the instructions on the product label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance on missed doses; do not double up on doses without medical advice.
* **Q: Is it safe for everyone?** A: No.  Tocilizumab is contraindicated in individuals with active infections and hypersensitivity to the medication.  It carries risks for certain patient groups and should only be used under strict medical supervision.
