**Generic Name:** Tocilizumab

**Usage:** Tocilizumab is a medication used to treat several inflammatory conditions.  Its specific uses include:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  It's used to reduce the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe RA in adults who have not responded adequately to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  It can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate.
* **Giant cell arteritis (GCA):** To treat GCA in adults.
* **Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA):**  Used to treat PJIA in children aged 2 years and older who have not responded adequately to other treatments.

* **CAR T-cell-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS):** Used to treat severe or life-threatening CRS in adults and children.
* **COVID-19:** In hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen.  Use is generally reserved for specific patient populations based on guidelines and clinical judgment.  Its use in COVID-19 is less common now due to the development of other treatments.

**How it Works:** Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the action of the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). IL-6 is a cytokine involved in inflammation. By blocking IL-6R, tocilizumab reduces inflammation and helps alleviate symptoms of the conditions it treats.
