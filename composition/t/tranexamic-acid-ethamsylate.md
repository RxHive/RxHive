# Tranexamic Acid + Ethamsylate
### Generic Name
Tranexamic Acid + Ethamsylate

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to control and reduce excessive bleeding, particularly in situations where bleeding is caused by problems with blood clotting.  It's often prescribed for various conditions resulting in abnormal bleeding, including:

* **Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding):** This is a common primary use, helping to reduce blood loss during menstruation.
* **Post-surgical bleeding:**  It can help minimize bleeding after certain surgical procedures.
* **Bleeding from trauma:** In some cases, it might be used to manage bleeding resulting from injuries.
* **Other bleeding disorders:** While not always a first-line treatment, it may be used in conjunction with other therapies for various bleeding disorders where a reduction in bleeding is needed.

It's crucial to understand that this combination is not suitable for all types of bleeding.  A healthcare professional will determine its appropriateness based on the specific cause and severity of the bleeding.  It's not a substitute for addressing the underlying cause of the bleeding.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific condition, the patient's age, weight, and the severity of bleeding.  **It is absolutely essential to follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There is no standardized "one-size-fits-all" dosage for this combination.

* **Oral administration (tablets):** Dosages are usually determined based on the individual case and the type of bleeding. Your doctor will provide the exact dosage and schedule.  
* **Intravenous (IV) administration:** IV administration is less common for this combination and is typically reserved for situations requiring rapid control of severe bleeding. The dosage and rate of administration would be strictly controlled and monitored by a medical professional in a hospital setting.  

**Children:** The use of Tranexamic Acid + Ethamsylate in children requires careful consideration and precise dosage adjustments based on their weight and specific condition.  It is not usually recommended without close medical supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


Less common but more serious side effects:

* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism): This is a serious concern, and any symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg swelling should be reported immediately to a doctor.
* Seizures
* Visual disturbances
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Tranexamic acid works by inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis). It helps to stabilize the blood clot formation process, reducing excessive bleeding.  Ethamsylate acts by strengthening capillary walls (the smallest blood vessels), thus reducing blood leakage from them. The combination therefore works on two levels to decrease bleeding: by enhancing clot formation and by improving capillary resistance.
