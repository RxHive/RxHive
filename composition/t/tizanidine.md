# Tizanidine

**Generic Name:** Tizanidine

**Usage:**

Tizanidine is a muscle relaxant used to treat muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological conditions.  It's also sometimes used to treat muscle stiffness and pain associated with these conditions.  It's important to note that tizanidine is a prescription medication and should only be used as directed by a doctor.  It's not appropriate for treating all types of muscle spasms or pain.

**Side Effects:**

Tizanidine can cause several side effects, some common and others less so.  The most common include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect and can be significant.  Driving or operating machinery should be avoided until the effects of the medication are known.
* **Dry mouth:** This can be uncomfortable but usually resolves itself.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** This can cause dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when standing up quickly.
* **Weakness:** Generalized weakness or fatigue.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Headache:**  Common side effect.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Liver problems (rare but serious):**  Monitor for signs like jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), dark urine, or abdominal pain.  This necessitates immediate medical attention.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Bradycardia (slow heart rate):**  Requires medical attention.
* **Liver failure (rare but potentially fatal):** Immediate medical attention is needed.
* **Depression:**  Seek medical advice if experiencing significant changes in mood.


**How it Works:**

Tizanidine works by affecting the central nervous system. It acts on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord, reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters that cause muscle spasms.  By inhibiting these neurotransmitters, it helps to relax the muscles.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking tizanidine?**  No. Alcohol can significantly increase the drowsiness and other side effects of tizanidine.  It's strongly advised to avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **Can I take tizanidine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Tizanidine can interact with several medications, including certain antidepressants, opioid pain relievers, and blood pressure medications.

* **How long does it take for tizanidine to work?** The onset of effects varies depending on individual factors, but it can take several days for the full therapeutic effect to be achieved.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, especially those listed as serious above.  Less serious side effects might improve over time, but you should still let your doctor know.

* **Can I stop taking tizanidine suddenly?**  No.  Stopping tizanidine suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Your doctor should help you gradually reduce your dose to minimize withdrawal effects.
