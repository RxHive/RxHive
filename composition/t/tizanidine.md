# Tizanidine
### Generic Name
Tizanidine

### Usage
Tizanidine is primarily used to treat muscle spasticity, a condition characterized by increased muscle tone and stiffness, often resulting from neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  It works by acting on the central nervous system to reduce the signals that cause muscle spasms.  While its primary use is for spasticity, tizanidine is sometimes used off-label as an adjunctive therapy to manage muscle spasms and musculoskeletal pain, often in conjunction with other medications like NSAIDs or acetaminophen.  However, it's crucial to remember that this is off-label use and should only be considered under a doctor's supervision.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The starting dose of tizanidine is typically low (2mg) and is usually taken at bedtime to minimize daytime drowsiness.  The dose can be gradually increased, under medical supervision,  to a maximum of 36mg per day, divided into 3 or 4 doses.  The increment of increase is typically 2-4mg daily, with a minimum of 1-4 days between dose increases.  For off-label use in muscle spasm and pain, the starting dose is usually 2-4mg every 6-12 hours as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 24mg.  It's extremely important to note that the medication should be tapered gradually when stopping treatment to avoid rebound effects like increased blood pressure and muscle stiffness, particularly for patients on higher doses or long-term treatment.  Capsules and tablets are not bioequivalent, especially when taken with food, so consistency in formulation is important.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of tizanidine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Individuals with liver impairment should use tizanidine with extreme caution, and a lower dose may be necessary.  Those with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) also require caution and potentially reduced dosing.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Weakness (asthenia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Nervousness
* Speech problems
* Hallucinations
* Delusions
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Constipation
* Vomiting
* Liver problems (abnormal liver function tests)
* Allergic reactions (including, rarely, anaphylaxis)

If you experience any side effects, especially severe or unusual ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Tizanidine is a central alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.  In simpler terms, it works in the central nervous system to decrease the signals that trigger muscle spasms.  It primarily affects polysynaptic pathways (complex nerve pathways), reducing the stimulation of spinal motor neurons that lead to muscle contractions.  This ultimately leads to a reduction in muscle stiffness and spasticity.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tizanidine is contraindicated in individuals concurrently taking ciprofloxacin or fluvoxamine (potent CYP1A2 inhibitors).
* **Drug Interactions:** Tizanidine can interact with many other medications, including ACE inhibitors, alpha-2 antagonists, beta-blockers, CNS depressants, CYP1A2 inhibitors, estrogens, alcohol, hypotensive agents, MAO inhibitors, QTC-prolonging agents, SSRIs, serotonin/norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors, and TCAs.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, psychiatric disorders, those at risk of low blood pressure, and older adults. Avoid tasks requiring alertness (e.g., driving) while taking this medication, especially at the start of treatment or after a dosage increase.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using tizanidine.
* **Hepatotoxicity:**  Tizanidine carries a risk of liver damage.  Regular monitoring of liver function tests may be necessary.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take tizanidine with alcohol?**
A: No, avoid alcohol while taking tizanidine as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and low blood pressure.

**Q: How should I store tizanidine?**
A: Store tizanidine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Can I stop taking tizanidine suddenly?**
A: No, always taper off tizanidine gradually under your doctor's supervision to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

**Q: Is tizanidine habit-forming?**
A:  Tizanidine is not considered a habit-forming medication in the same way as opioids. However, the body can become accustomed to its effects, necessitating careful tapering upon discontinuation.
