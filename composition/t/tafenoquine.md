# Tafenoquine
### Generic Name
Tafenoquine

### Usage
Tafenoquine is an antimalarial medication primarily used for preventing relapses of *Plasmodium vivax* malaria.  It's crucial to understand that tafenoquine *does not treat* the acute phase of *P. vivax* infection; it's used *after* the initial infection has been treated with another antimalarial drug like chloroquine.  It works by eliminating the dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) of the parasite, preventing them from reactivating and causing a relapse of the disease.  Additionally, tafenoquine can be used for malaria prophylaxis (prevention) in areas where malaria is prevalent, though this usage is less common.  It's important to note that the concomitant use of tafenoquine with antimalarials other than chloroquine isn't recommended due to a heightened risk of *P. vivax* recurrence.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Malaria Relapse Prevention (Radical Cure):** A single 300 mg oral dose is administered on either day one or two alongside chloroquine treatment for acute *P. vivax* malaria.

* **Malaria Prophylaxis:**
    * **Loading Dose:** 200 mg orally once daily for three days before traveling to a malaria-endemic region.
    * **Maintenance Dose:** 200 mg orally once weekly, starting seven days after the final loading dose. This can continue for up to six months.
    * **Terminal Dose:** 200 mg orally as a single dose seven days after the last maintenance dose upon leaving the malaria-endemic region.  Dosage adjustments may be needed if doses are missed (see Dosage Adjustments below).

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Malaria Relapse Prevention:**  Adolescents aged 16 and older receive a single 300 mg oral dose on day one or two of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment.

* **Malaria Prophylaxis:** Adolescents aged 18 and older follow the same adult prophylaxis regimen.  Tafenoquine is not currently approved for malaria prophylaxis in children younger than 18 years old.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Use in these populations requires careful monitoring for adverse reactions.  Instructions for missed doses in malaria prophylaxis are provided in the detailed information (see original data).


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Back pain
* Vortex keratopathy (eye condition)
* Methemoglobinemia (abnormal hemoglobin level)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Nausea and vomiting
* Decreased hemoglobin levels
* Hemolytic anemia (breakdown of red blood cells) â€“ particularly dangerous in those with G6PD deficiency
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Psychiatric effects (e.g., insomnia, abnormal dreams, anxiety)
* Other less frequent but more severe side effects are listed in the detailed information


If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Tafenoquine is an 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial. Its precise mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to act against all stages of the *Plasmodium* parasite's life cycle, including the hypnozoites residing in the liver. This action is key to preventing relapses.  Proposed mechanisms involve inhibiting hematin polymerization within the parasite, inducing parasite cell death, and causing red blood cell shrinkage.

### Precautions

* **G6PD Deficiency:** Tafenoquine is absolutely contraindicated in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or those with unknown G6PD status, due to a high risk of severe hemolytic anemia.  This is critical to stress because hemolytic anemia can be life-threatening.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tafenoquine is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of hemolytic anemia in the fetus if the fetus has G6PD deficiency.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated if the infant has G6PD deficiency or if the infant's G6PD status is unknown.

* **Psychiatric History:**  Tafenoquine should be used cautiously in individuals with a history of psychotic disorders or current psychotic symptoms.

* **Drug Interactions:**  The detailed information provides more specifics about interactions with other drugs.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney problems, as dosage adjustments are not established. Careful monitoring is necessary.

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to tafenoquine, other 8-aminoquinolines, or any component of the formulation.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Tafenoquine to treat an acute malaria infection?**  A: No, Tafenoquine is not for treating acute malaria infections. It only prevents relapses of *P. vivax* malaria after the acute infection is treated with another antimalarial drug.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose of Tafenoquine during prophylaxis?** A:  Refer to the Dosage Adjustments section for specific instructions based on the missed dose(s).

* **Q: How should I store Tafenoquine?** A: Store Tafenoquine as directed on the medication label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q:  Is Tafenoquine safe for everyone?** A: No, Tafenoquine is not suitable for everyone. It's crucial to consult with a doctor before taking Tafenoquine to ensure it's safe and appropriate given your health status, particularly regarding G6PD status.  Pre-treatment G6PD testing is vital.
