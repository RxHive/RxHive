# Tafamidis Meglumine
### Generic Name
Tafamidis Meglumine

### Usage

Tafamidis meglumine is a medication used to treat the cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease) associated with transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis) in adults.  ATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressive disease where an abnormal protein, transthyretin (TTR), misfolds and deposits in various organs, including the heart. This buildup can lead to heart failure and other serious complications. Tafamidis meglumine's primary purpose is to reduce cardiovascular mortality (death from heart-related causes) and the risk of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in patients with this condition.  It can be used for both hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (caused by genetic mutations) and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis (not caused by genetic mutations).


### Dosage

**Amyloid Cardiomyopathy:**

* **Adults:** The usual dosage is 80 mg of Tafamidis meglumine taken orally once daily.  It is crucial to understand that Tafamidis meglumine and Tafamidis (a related medication) are *not* interchangeable on a milligram-for-milligram basis.  Therefore, do not attempt to substitute one for the other without explicit instruction from a physician.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Tafamidis meglumine in children have not been established.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling currently does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, it is essential to discuss any pre-existing liver or kidney conditions with your doctor before starting this medication.

### Side Effects

While the manufacturer's labeling doesn't list specific adverse reactions, it's important to be aware that any medication can cause side effects.  It is vital to report any unusual symptoms or changes in your health to your healthcare provider immediately.  

### How it Works

Tafamidis meglumine works by stabilizing transthyretin (TTR), the protein responsible for ATTR amyloidosis.  TTR normally exists as a stable tetramer (a complex of four protein molecules). In ATTR amyloidosis, this tetramer breaks down into individual misfolded monomers, which then clump together to form amyloid fibrils that deposit in tissues and organs. Tafamidis meglumine binds to TTR, preventing the tetramer from dissociating and thus reducing the formation of these damaging amyloid fibrils. By stabilizing TTR, it slows the progression of the disease and helps to protect the heart.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Tafamidis meglumine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity or allergy to tafamidis or any component of the medication.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tafamidis meglumine may cause fetal harm.  Women of childbearing age should discuss pregnancy planning and prevention with their doctor.  The excretion of Tafamidis meglumine in breast milk is unknown, so breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Tafamidis meglumine may increase serum concentrations of certain medications (BCRP/ABCG2 substrates).  Your doctor should be aware of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to ensure there are no potential interactions.

* **General:** Swallow the capsules whole; do not crush or break them. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.
