# Trametinib
### Generic Name
Trametinib

### Usage

Trametinib is a targeted cancer therapy primarily used to treat certain types of cancer with a specific genetic mutation called BRAF V600E or V600K.  This mutation is found in some melanoma (skin cancer), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer.

Its primary use is in treating unresectable or metastatic melanoma (cancer that has spread or cannot be surgically removed).  It's often used in combination with another drug, dabrafenib, for improved effectiveness.  

Secondary uses include:

* **Adjuvant treatment of melanoma:** Following complete surgical removal of melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations and lymph node involvement, Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib helps prevent the cancer from returning.
* **Metastatic NSCLC:** Trametinib, again combined with dabrafenib, is used to treat metastatic NSCLC (lung cancer that has spread) with the BRAF V600E mutation.
* **Anaplastic thyroid cancer:**  For locally advanced or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer with the BRAF V600E mutation and no effective local treatment options,  Trametinib is used in combination with dabrafenib.


It's crucial to remember that Trametinib is not suitable for all cancers or all patients with these cancers.  A doctor must confirm the presence of the BRAF V600E or V600K mutation through an FDA-approved test before prescribing Trametinib.


### Dosage

Trametinib is typically administered orally as a 2 mg tablet once daily.  The dosage is the same whether it's used as a single agent or in combination with dabrafenib.  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  For adjuvant melanoma treatment, the course typically lasts up to one year.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Trametinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are not always clearly defined in the prescribing information for certain situations like moderate to severe hepatic or renal impairment.  A healthcare professional will make decisions about dosage adjustments based on individual patient factors and potential side effects. Dosage reductions are common for managing toxicities like skin reactions, cardiomyopathy (heart problems), and other adverse events.  These adjustments are made under strict medical supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients, often in combination therapy with dabrafenib) include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash (including acne-like rash, redness, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome â€“ a painful rash on the palms and soles of the feet)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Decreased appetite
* Chills
* Dizziness
* Cough
* Shortness of breath


Less common but serious side effects (requiring immediate medical attention) include:

* Cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease)
* Interstitial lung disease (lung inflammation)
* Severe skin reactions
* Severe bleeding
* Retinal problems (e.g., retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion)
* New primary cancers (skin or other)


If any side effects occur, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Trametinib is a type of medicine called a kinase inhibitor.  It works by targeting a specific protein called MEK, which plays a critical role in the growth and spread of cancer cells with the BRAF V600 mutation.  The BRAF mutation leads to constant activation of the MEK protein, promoting uncontrolled cell growth. Trametinib blocks MEK activity, slowing or stopping cancer cell growth and leading to cell death (apoptosis). When used with dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, the combined effect is a more potent blockade of the cancer cell growth pathway.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Trametinib should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Trametinib or any of its ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Trametinib may interact with other medications.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting Trametinib.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Trametinib is a pregnancy category D drug, meaning it can cause harm to a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for four months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for four months after the last dose.
* **Specific Populations:**  Individuals with pre-existing conditions like heart disease, liver or kidney disease, or bleeding disorders should be carefully monitored while taking Trametinib.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood pressure, liver function, and heart function is crucial while using Trametinib, especially during combination therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Trametinib?** A: Store Trametinib tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Follow the specific storage instructions provided with the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Trametinib?** A:  Discuss alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider, as it may exacerbate some side effects.

* **Q:  How long will I need to take Trametinib?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and the progression of your cancer.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  Many side effects can be managed, but some may necessitate dosage adjustment or discontinuation of the medication.
