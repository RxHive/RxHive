# Tolazamide
### Generic Name
Tolazamide

### Usage
Tolazamide is a sulfonylurea oral medication used as an adjunct to diet in managing mild to moderately severe, stable type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's important to note that newer-generation sulfonylureas are generally preferred over Tolazamide due to a lower risk of hypoglycemia.  Tolazamide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  The initial dose is typically 100-250 mg daily, taken with breakfast or the first main meal.  Dosage adjustments are made in increments of 100-250 mg weekly, based on blood glucose response.  The average maintenance dose ranges from 250-500 mg daily, but can reach a maximum of 1000 mg daily.  Lower initial and maintenance doses are recommended for malnourished, underweight, or elderly patients.  For patients converting from insulin, the starting Tolazamide dose depends on the previous insulin dose.  Switching from other oral hypoglycemics also requires careful titration, especially from chlorpropamide, due to prolonged effects of the latter.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Tolazamide in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer’s labeling; however, conservative initial and maintenance doses with careful monitoring are recommended in both cases.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Constipation
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Fatigue
*   Skin rash
*   Pruritus (itching)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
*   Agranulocytosis (severe decrease in white blood cells)
*   Aplastic anemia
*   Hemolytic anemia
*   Jaundice
*   Allergic reactions

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Tolazamide works by stimulating the release of insulin from the beta-cells in the pancreas. This happens by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels within the pancreatic beta cells. The released insulin then helps lower blood glucose levels by increasing glucose uptake by cells and decreasing glucose production by the liver.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Tolazamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Tolazamide, sulfonylureas, or any component of the formulation; those with type 1 diabetes mellitus; those with diabetic ketoacidosis; those with uremia; and those with porphyria.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Tolazamide's effects can be increased by certain drugs like antifungals (miconazole, fluconazole), NSAIDs, and highly protein-bound drugs (salicylates, sulfonamides, etc.). Conversely, its effects can be decreased by thiazides, diuretics, corticosteroids, and others.  Concomitant use of these medications should be carefully considered and may require dosage adjustments.
* **Warnings:** Tolazamide increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality (with high doses), hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity reactions, and weight gain.  Use with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, during stressful periods (infection, surgery), in malnourished individuals, alcoholics, the elderly, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and when used with other hypoglycemic drugs.  Pregnant women should discontinue Tolazamide at least two weeks before delivery.  The drug’s excretion in breast milk is unknown; mothers should consult with their doctors to weigh the risks and benefits of continuing breastfeeding while taking Tolazamide.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Tolazamide?** A: It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking Tolazamide as it can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose.

* **Q: How should I store Tolazamide?** A: Store Tolazamide at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  What are the signs of hypoglycemia?** A: Symptoms include sweating, trembling, dizziness, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  If you experience these, check your blood sugar and follow your doctor's instructions for treatment.

* **Q:  Is Tolazamide right for me?** A: Only your doctor can determine the appropriate treatment for your diabetes.  They will consider your individual health circumstances and medical history to make a personalized recommendation.
