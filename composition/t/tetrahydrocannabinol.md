# Tetrahydrocannabinol
### Generic Name
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)

### Usage

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis.  Its main medical uses are:

* **Treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS:** THC can stimulate appetite and help patients gain weight, combating the significant weight loss often experienced with AIDS.

* **Treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy:** For patients who haven't responded adequately to standard antiemetic treatments, THC can offer relief from the debilitating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.

While not officially approved for these uses in all jurisdictions, THC is also being explored and used off-label for conditions such as:

* **Chronic pain management:** THC interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system, influencing pain perception.

* **Multiple sclerosis spasticity:** Some studies suggest THC may help alleviate muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.

* **Sleep disorders (such as obstructive sleep apnea):** Research is ongoing, but THC's sedative properties are being investigated as a potential treatment aid.  However, it's crucial to note that this is off-label use and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's weight, and their response to the medication.  It's vital to follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional precisely.  The following are examples and should not be interpreted as a prescription:

**Adults:**

* **Anorexia in AIDS patients:**  Dosages typically start low (e.g., 2.5 mg twice daily) and are gradually increased based on tolerance and effectiveness, with a maximum daily dose usually not exceeding 20 mg.  The medication may be administered in capsule or solution form.

* **Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:**  Dosage is often calculated based on body surface area (mg/m²), with initial doses administered before and then repeatedly after chemotherapy.  Careful titration is necessary to find the effective dose while minimizing side effects.  Both capsule and solution forms are available.

* **Off-label uses:** Dosages for conditions like chronic pain or sleep disorders vary widely and should be determined and monitored closely by a physician.


**Children:**

The use of THC in children is generally not recommended except under very specific circumstances and with careful monitoring by a specialist.  Off-label pediatric use is limited and should only be considered in exceptional situations, with a thorough risk-benefit assessment conducted.  Dosage in children, if deemed necessary, is typically calculated based on body surface area (mg/m²).


**Administration:**

THC can be administered orally in capsule or solution form.  Specific instructions on timing in relation to meals or other medications must be followed exactly.

If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

THC exerts its effects primarily by binding to cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the brain and throughout the body. CB1 receptors are largely responsible for the psychoactive effects, affecting mood, appetite, pain perception, and coordination. CB2 receptors are more involved in immune function and pain modulation.  By interacting with these receptors, THC can alter neurotransmitter release, influencing various bodily functions and leading to its therapeutic and side effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** THC is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to THC or any of the formulation's components, as well as those currently taking certain medications such as disulfiram or metronidazole.

* **Drug Interactions:** THC can interact with several medications, including alcohol, other CNS depressants, anticoagulants, and certain antidepressants.  Always inform healthcare providers about all medications being taken.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  THC use during pregnancy and lactation is generally discouraged due to potential risks to the developing fetus and infant.

* **Specific Populations:**  Elderly individuals and patients with cardiovascular, psychiatric, or seizure disorders should use THC with extreme caution and under strict medical supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is THC addictive?** A:  THC can be habit-forming and lead to dependence, especially with chronic and high-dose use.

* **Q: How should I store THC?** A: Store THC medication as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture. Keep it out of the reach of children.

* **Q: Can THC be used recreationally?** A:  The recreational use of THC is illegal in many jurisdictions and poses significant health risks.  This information pertains solely to the medicinal use of THC under a physician's supervision.
