# Testolactone
### Generic Name
Testolactone

### Usage
Testolactone is a medication used as an adjunctive therapy in the palliative treatment of advanced or disseminated breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  It's crucial to understand that it is *not* used to treat breast cancer in men.  Its primary role is to help manage the symptoms and progression of the disease, offering palliative care rather than a cure.  It does not directly kill cancer cells but works by interfering with hormone production that fuels the growth of certain breast cancers.

### Dosage
The standard oral dosage for adult postmenopausal women with advanced or disseminated breast cancer is 250 mg four times a day (QID). Treatment should continue for at least three months.  There is no established safe and effective dosage for children or adolescents.  The medication is not intended for use in men with breast cancer.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Testolactone can include:

* Maculopapular erythema (skin rash)
* Increased blood pressure
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Aches and edema (swelling) of the extremities
* Glossitis (inflammation of the tongue)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Nausea and vomiting


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects may occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Testolactone is a synthetic derivative of testosterone, but it lacks significant androgenic activity (meaning it doesn't act like the male hormone testosterone).  It functions as an aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens (male hormones) into estrogens (female hormones) like estradiol and estrone.  Many breast cancers rely on estrogen for growth. By inhibiting aromatase, Testolactone reduces the production of these estrogens, slowing down the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancers.  It's important to note that this effect is temporary, usually lasting only around three months.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Testolactone is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the medication and in men with breast cancer.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions aren't extensively detailed, it's vital to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Testolactone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Its use should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  This medication is approved only for postmenopausal women.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with pre-existing conditions like heart, kidney, or liver disease should be carefully monitored, as Testolactone can exacerbate edema (swelling).  Monitor for hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), especially during periods of active bone metastasis remission.
