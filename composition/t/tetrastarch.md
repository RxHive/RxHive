# Tetrastarch
### Generic Name
Tetrastarch (hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4)

### Usage
Tetrastarch is a synthetic colloid and plasma volume expander primarily used to treat and prevent hypovolemia (low blood volume) in adults and children.  It's particularly helpful in situations where blood loss needs to be compensated for, such as during surgery or trauma.  However, important limitations exist, as detailed in the precautions section.  It is *not* a substitute for whole blood or blood products.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage depends on the amount of blood lost, the patient's hemodynamic status (blood flow and pressure), and the degree of hemodilution (dilution of blood components). It's crucial to titrate the dose (adjust it according to the patient's response) to individual needs.  In cases of severe dehydration, crystalloid solutions should be administered first.  The maximum dose is typically 50 mL/kg/day (or up to 3500 mL per day in a 70kg patient), administered over several days. The initial infusion of 10-20mL should be given slowly, closely monitoring the patient for anaphylactoid reactions.


**Children:** Dosage is also individualized and depends on factors mentioned above.  The use of hydroxyethyl starch solutions is not recommended in severe sepsis and septic shock in neonatal and pediatric patients.  

* **Infants and children <2 years:** Usual range 7–25 mL/kg/dose; mean reported dose 16 ± 9 mL/kg/dose; maximum 50 mL/kg/day.
* **Children 2–12 years:** Usual range 25–47 mL/kg/dose; mean reported dose 36 ± 11 mL/kg/dose; maximum 50 mL/kg/day.
* **Adolescents:** Same as adult dose.

**Administration:** Tetrastarch is administered intravenously (IV) via infusion, often using an infusion pump to control the rate.  The initial dose should be given slowly to monitor for allergic reactions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustment is recommended for hepatic impairment; however, it's contraindicated in patients with severe liver disease.  Tetrastarch should be avoided in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those undergoing dialysis.  Discontinue use immediately if signs of renal injury appear.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Increased serum amylase levels (enzyme in the pancreas)
* Pruritus (itching) – often dose-dependent and may be delayed
* Skin rash
* Anemia
* Increased coagulation time
* Decreased levels of clotting factors
* Decreased hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells in blood)
* Prolonged prothrombin time (a measure of blood clotting)
* Wound hemorrhage


**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Acute renal failure
* Anaphylactoid reaction
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Bronchospasm (constriction of airways)
* Circulatory shock
* Flu-like symptoms
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Shock
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)


Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Tetrastarch expands plasma volume due to its large colloidal starch molecules.  These molecules increase the osmotic pressure of the blood, drawing fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream, thereby increasing blood volume and improving blood pressure.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to hydroxyethyl starch or any component of the formulation
* Critically ill adult patients (including those with sepsis) due to increased risk of mortality and renal injury
* Renal failure with oliguria or anuria (low or no urine output) not related to hypovolemia
* Patients receiving dialysis
* Patients with intracranial bleeding
* Fluid overload conditions (e.g., pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure)
* Severe hypernatremia (high sodium levels)
* Severe hyperchloremia (high chloride levels)
* Severe liver disease
* Pre-existing coagulation or bleeding disorders
* Severe hyperkalemia (high potassium levels – for 6% HES 130/0.4 in isotonic electrolyte solution only)

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of bleeding, hematologic effects (changes in blood components), anaphylactoid reactions, and fluid overload. Use with caution in patients at risk for blood volume overexpansion (very young or elderly patients), those with hepatic impairment, and breastfeeding women.

**Drug Interactions:** Tetrastarch may enhance the nephrotoxic (kidney-damaging) effects of arbekacin.  Avoid combining them.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Tetrastarch is a Category C drug during pregnancy (potential risks to the fetus).  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is Tetrastarch a blood substitute?** A: No, it's a plasma volume expander; it increases blood volume but doesn't replace the function of red blood cells or clotting factors.

* **Q: How is Tetrastarch stored?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature, protected from light. Check the product label for specific storage requirements.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication and contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.
