# Thiopental Sodium
### Generic Name
Thiopental Sodium

### Usage
Thiopental sodium is a short-acting barbiturate primarily used for the induction of general anesthesia.  This means it helps to quickly put a patient to sleep before surgery or other medical procedures requiring general anesthesia.  It's also used as an adjunctive agent during anesthesia, meaning it can be used alongside other anesthetic drugs to maintain a state of unconsciousness.  Beyond anesthesia, thiopental sodium has been used to treat acute convulsive states (seizures) and to reduce elevated intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull).  However, its use in these latter indications is less common now due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following dosage information is for general guidance only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.  Dosage adjustments are frequently necessary based on individual patient factors and should always be determined by a qualified healthcare professional.

**Adults:**

* **Anesthesia (IV):** Induction typically requires 3-6 mg/kg, with a maximum total dose of 500 mg. Maintenance doses of 25-100 mg may be administered every 10-12 minutes as needed.
* **Increased Intracranial Pressure (IV):**  1.5-3.5 mg/kg per dose, repeated as necessary to control intracranial pressure.
* **Seizures (IV):** 75-125 mg, repeated as needed.  Higher doses (125-250 mg over 10 minutes) might be necessary for seizures following local anesthetic administration.

**Children:**

* **Anesthesia (IV):**  Induction typically requires 2-6 mg/kg given slowly over 10-15 seconds.  A repeat dose might be needed after a minute if necessary, but the total dose shouldn't exceed 7 mg/kg.
* **Increased Intracranial Pressure (IV):** 1.5-2 mg/kg per dose, repeated as needed.
* **Seizures (IV):** 2-3 mg/kg per dose, repeated as needed.
* **Sedation (Rectal):**  5-10 mg/kg.  Rectal administration is less common for thiopental.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, since thiopental is metabolized by the liver, reduced doses are often recommended in patients with liver problems. In those with kidney impairment, caution is advised as the drug's effects may be prolonged.  Consult medical literature and expert advice for specific guidance.



### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing)
* Apnea (cessation of breathing)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Pain at the injection site
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching)

Less common but serious side effects:

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Agranulocytosis (severe reduction in white blood cells)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)


If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Thiopental sodium is a barbiturate that acts on the central nervous system (CNS).  It enhances the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits neuronal activity. By increasing GABA's inhibitory effects, thiopental reduces neuronal excitability, leading to sedation, hypnosis (sleep), and ultimately, general anesthesia.  At higher doses, it also exhibits anticonvulsant properties by suppressing seizure activity.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Thiopental sodium is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to barbiturates, acute asthma, porphyria, severe respiratory disease, or when maintaining an adequate airway is impossible during surgery. It's also contraindicated in situations like severe shock, absence of suitable veins, and certain cardiac conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, other sedatives) should be avoided due to additive effects, potentially leading to excessive sedation and respiratory depression. Interactions with other medications can also alter thiopental's effects.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Thiopental sodium crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.  Use during pregnancy should be avoided unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Breastfeeding should be temporarily suspended or breast milk expressed and discarded before and after administration.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with hepatic or renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or other underlying conditions require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments.  Elderly patients are also at increased risk for adverse effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take thiopental sodium to work?** A:  The onset of action is rapid, typically within seconds to minutes after intravenous administration.

* **Q: How long does the effect of thiopental sodium last?** A:  The duration of action is relatively short, usually lasting only 15-30 minutes for induction of anesthesia.

* **Q: How should thiopental sodium be stored?** A:  Store it according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually in a cool, dry place, protected from light.

* **Q:  Is thiopental sodium addictive?** A:  Barbiturates have a potential for dependence and abuse, though the short duration of action of thiopental limits this risk compared to longer-acting barbiturates.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Thiopental sodium is not typically used for chronic conditions and is administered on an "as-needed" basis.  Do not attempt to self-adjust doses; consult with a medical professional.
