# Terbinafine + Fluticasone Propionate

There is no generic combination drug currently available that combines terbinafine and fluticasone propionate.  Terbinafine is an antifungal, and fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid. They are used for completely different conditions and are not typically prescribed together.  Therefore, providing details in the requested format is not possible for a non-existent combination drug.

If you have a specific skin condition and your doctor has prescribed a combination therapy, it's crucial to verify the exact names and proportions of the ingredients listed on the prescription label.  Then, you can search for information on each specific ingredient.  Using a reliable source like the FDA website or your doctor/pharmacist is recommended.
