# Tasosartan
### Generic Name
Tasosartan

### Usage
Tasosartan was a medication intended for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  Its development was discontinued due to concerns about liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity).  Therefore, it is **not currently available** for medical use.  This information is for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for its use.

### Dosage
Since Tasosartan is no longer available, there are no current dosage recommendations.  Information regarding dosage from previous research should not be used to self-medicate.

### Side Effects
Because Tasosartan's development was halted due to safety concerns, the complete profile of its side effects is not fully established.  However, the primary concern identified during its development was hepatotoxicity (liver damage). Other potential side effects were likely, but not fully documented due to the discontinuation of development.

### How it Works
Tasosartan was designed as an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow, raising blood pressure. Tasosartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II at its receptor sites (AT1 receptors) in blood vessels and adrenal glands. This blockage prevents the vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and reduces the release of aldosterone, a hormone that increases sodium and water retention.  By reducing vasoconstriction and fluid retention, Tasosartan aimed to lower blood pressure.

### Precautions
Given its discontinuation due to hepatotoxicity, the most significant precaution regarding Tasosartan is to **avoid its use entirely.**  There is a substantial risk of liver damage.  Information on other potential interactions or precautions for specific populations (pregnant women, children, elderly) is incomplete and unreliable due to the termination of its development.
