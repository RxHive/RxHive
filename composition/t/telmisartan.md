# Telmisartan
### Generic Name
Telmisartan

### Usage
Telmisartan is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily, thus lowering blood pressure.  A secondary, significant use is in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events (such as heart attack, stroke, or death) in patients with high blood pressure and other risk factors, particularly those who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The starting dose for hypertension is typically 20-40 mg once daily. The dose can be increased to a maximum of 80 mg once daily, depending on individual response and the doctor's judgment. For cardiovascular risk reduction, the usual dose is 80 mg once daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of telmisartan in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  In patients with liver problems, the starting dose should be low, and the dose should be increased slowly under close medical supervision.  For patients with kidney problems, including those on dialysis,  a dosage adjustment is usually not necessary, but close monitoring for side effects, particularly low blood pressure, is important.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Pain
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Cough
* Back pain
* Myalgia (muscle pain)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (can occur in less than 1% of patients):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Acute renal failure
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Liver problems


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow, increasing blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II by binding to its receptors, preventing vasoconstriction and reducing aldosterone secretion. This results in relaxed blood vessels and lower blood pressure.  By lowering blood pressure, it helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Telmisartan is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to telmisartan or any of its components; in patients with severe kidney problems and diabetes mellitus who are also taking aliskiren; and in patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance (depending on the formulation).

**Interactions:** Telmisartan can interact with several other medications, including ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, and some other blood pressure medications. This interaction can cause a dangerous increase or decrease in blood pressure. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Warnings:**  Telmisartan should be used with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, heart valve problems, or a history of angioedema.  It's particularly important to be cautious during pregnancy as it can cause injury or death to the developing fetus.  Pregnancy should be avoided while taking telmisartan, and the medication should be stopped immediately if pregnancy occurs.  The safety of telmisartan during breastfeeding is unknown.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Telmisartan?**
A:  While moderate alcohol consumption is generally fine, excessive alcohol can lower blood pressure and increase the risk of side effects. Consult your doctor regarding alcohol intake.

**Q: How should I store Telmisartan?**
A: Store Telmisartan at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Can I stop taking Telmisartan suddenly?**
A: No, stopping Telmisartan suddenly can be harmful.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: What if I experience a severe side effect?**
A: Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects, such as angioedema, significant swelling, difficulty breathing, or chest pain.
