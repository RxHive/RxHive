# Tofacitinib

**Generic Name:** Tofacitinib

**Usage:**

Tofacitinib is used to treat several autoimmune diseases by suppressing the immune system.  Specific approved uses vary by country and may include:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  To reduce signs and symptoms, and to slow structural damage in moderately to severely active RA in adults who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate.
* **Psoriatic arthritis:** To reduce signs and symptoms in adults with moderate to severe active psoriatic arthritis.
* **Ulcerative colitis:** To induce and maintain remission in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.
* **Atopic dermatitis (eczema):** To treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and children (age 2 and older) whose condition is not adequately controlled by other therapies.


**Side Effects:**

Tofacitinib, like other immunosuppressants, carries a risk of serious side effects.  These can include:

* **Increased risk of infections:** This is a major concern, as a weakened immune system makes you more vulnerable to bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  Serious infections, including tuberculosis, can occur.
* **Serious cardiovascular events:**  Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots, and high blood pressure.
* **Malignancies (cancers):**  Increased risk of certain cancers, including lymphoma and skin cancer.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Headaches:**
* **Increased cholesterol and triglycerides:**
* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes.
* **Pneumonia:**
* **Thrombocytopenia:**  Low platelet count.
* **Herpes zoster (shingles):**
* **Hypertension (high blood pressure):**


**How it Works:**

Tofacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.  JAKs are enzymes that play a crucial role in the signaling pathways of the immune system.  By inhibiting JAKs, tofacitinib reduces the activity of immune cells, thereby lessening inflammation and the symptoms of autoimmune diseases.  This targeted approach helps to control the overactive immune response that characterizes these conditions.
