# Tofacitinib
### Generic Name
Tofacitinib

### Usage

Tofacitinib is a medication belonging to a class of drugs called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.  Its primary use is in the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis,  active psoriatic arthritis, and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.  It's also approved for treating active polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) in children aged 2 years and older.  In essence, tofacitinib works by suppressing the activity of the immune system, reducing inflammation and associated symptoms in these conditions.  While its primary use targets these specific autoimmune diseases, ongoing research continues to explore its potential in other inflammatory conditions.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the formulation used (immediate-release or extended-release tablets, oral solution).  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following is a summary and should *not* replace a doctor's prescription:

**Adults:**

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Immediate-release: 5 mg twice daily; Extended-release: 11 mg once daily.  May be used alone or with other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
* **Psoriatic Arthritis:** Immediate-release: 5 mg twice daily; Extended-release: 11 mg once daily.  Usually used with other non-biologic DMARDs.
* **Ulcerative Colitis:**  Dosage varies between an induction phase (higher dose for 8-16 weeks) and a maintenance phase (lower dose).  Immediate-release: Induction - 10 mg twice daily; Maintenance - 5 mg twice daily (or 10 mg twice daily if needed).  Extended-release: Induction - 22 mg once daily; Maintenance - 11 mg once daily (or 22 mg once daily if needed).

**Children (pcJIA, 2 years and older):** Dosage is determined by weight:  Oral solution: 10-20kg: 3.2mg twice daily; 20-40kg: 4mg twice daily; ≥40kg: 5mg twice daily. Tablets may be used for those weighing ≥40 kg.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment. These adjustments vary based on the severity of impairment and the specific tofacitinib formulation used. A healthcare professional should guide these adjustments.

**Important Note:** Tofacitinib should generally not be used in combination with biologic DMARDs or strong immunosuppressants like azathioprine, tacrolimus, or cyclosporine.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include infections (like upper respiratory tract infections) and nasopharyngitis.  Other possible side effects, varying in frequency, include:

* Headache
* Hypertension
* Skin rash
* Acne
* Increased cholesterol
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Urinary tract infection
* Anemia
* Herpes zoster infection

Less common, but serious side effects, include increased risk of serious infections (including tuberculosis, fungal infections, and opportunistic infections),  lymphoma, other malignancies, blood clots (thrombosis),  hepatotoxicity (liver damage), and interstitial lung disease.  **Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.**


### How it Works

Tofacitinib inhibits Janus kinases (JAKs), enzymes involved in transmitting signals that trigger inflammation in the body. By blocking these signals, tofacitinib reduces the immune system's activity, thereby lessening inflammation and alleviating symptoms of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:**  In individuals with a known hypersensitivity to tofacitinib or any formulation components.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients taking tofacitinib have an increased risk of serious infections, cardiovascular events, malignancies, thrombosis, and other adverse events.
* **Interactions:**  Tofacitinib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 enzymes).  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Vulnerable Groups:**  Special caution is needed in older adults, individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, liver or kidney problems, diabetes, or those with a history of infections or tuberculosis.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using tofacitinib.
* **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function tests, and other parameters is often necessary while taking tofacitinib.

### FAQs

* **Can I take tofacitinib with food?**  Yes, tofacitinib can be taken with or without food.
* **How should I store tofacitinib?**  Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist regarding missed doses; do not double up on doses.
* **Can I stop taking tofacitinib suddenly?**  No, it is generally not recommended to stop tofacitinib abruptly. Discuss any changes to your treatment plan with your doctor.
