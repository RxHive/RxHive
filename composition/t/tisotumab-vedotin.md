# Tisotumab Vedotin
### Generic Name
Tisotumab Vedotin

### Usage
Tisotumab vedotin is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.  This means it's used in patients whose cancer has come back after previous treatment (recurrent) or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). It's specifically indicated for those who have progressed despite prior chemotherapy.  The drug's primary use is in this specific population of cervical cancer patients.  There are currently no other approved uses.


### Dosage
The recommended dosage of Tisotumab vedotin for adults with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer is 2 mg/kg intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks. The maximum dose is 200 mg for patients weighing 100 kg or more. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Important Considerations:**  Before each infusion, patients require ophthalmic (eye) premedication with topical corticosteroid and vasoconstrictor eye drops, and the use of cooling eye packs during the infusion.  Patients should also use lubricating eye drops during treatment and for 30 days after the last dose.  Contact lens use should be avoided during treatment.

This medication is not approved for use in children, and dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function (see Precautions).

### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% of patients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness, pain in extremities)
*   Increased serum creatinine kinase levels (marker of muscle damage)
*   Alopecia (hair loss)
*   Skin rash
*   Decreased appetite
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Decreased hemoglobin (anemia)
*   Decreased neutrophil count (increased risk of infection)
*   Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP)
*   Eye irritation (conjunctivitis, keratitis)
*   Decreased serum albumin levels

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Hemorrhage (bleeding) – particularly pulmonary (lung) or central nervous system (brain) bleeding, which necessitate immediate discontinuation of the drug.
*   Severe ocular toxicity (vision loss, corneal ulceration) –  This is a boxed warning.
*   Pneumonitis (lung inflammation) – this can be life-threatening.
*   Severe peripheral neuropathy.

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Tisotumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). It works by targeting tissue factor (TF), a protein found on the surface of many cancer cells, including those in cervical cancer. The antibody part of the drug binds to TF, delivering a potent anti-cancer drug called monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) directly into the cancer cell. MMAE disrupts the microtubules inside the cancer cell, which are essential for cell division and survival. This ultimately leads to cancer cell death.  Beyond direct cell killing, Tisotumab vedotin also enhances the body's immune response against the cancer cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).


### Precautions
*   **Pregnancy:** Tisotumab vedotin may harm a developing fetus.  Pregnancy should be ruled out before starting treatment, and effective contraception is mandatory during and for a period after treatment. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 3 weeks afterward.
*   **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Tisotumab vedotin should generally be avoided in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment or with severe renal impairment.
*   **Hemorrhage:**  Increased risk of bleeding exists; close monitoring is vital.
*   **Ocular Toxicity:** This is a major concern; regular ophthalmological exams are essential. The premedication and post-treatment eye care protocols are crucial.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Certain drugs can interact with Tisotumab vedotin and affect its effectiveness or increase side effects.  Consult with a doctor or pharmacist about all medications being taken.  Specific examples include strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, efgartigimod alfa, and others. (See Interactions section in the provided details).
*   **Other Precautions:** Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain), pneumonitis (cough, shortness of breath), and other side effects.
