# Tranexamic Acid + Glutathione
**Please Note:**  There is no single, FDA-approved medication combining Tranexamic Acid and Glutathione.  The information below describes each drug individually and explores potential reasons for their combined use in some contexts.  It is crucial to understand that using these medications together should *only* be done under the strict supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.  They will assess individual needs and risks before recommending any combined treatment.

### Generic Name: Tranexamic Acid + Glutathione (Separate Drugs)

This information covers Tranexamic Acid and Glutathione as separate entities, frequently used in combination in some contexts, but not as a single pharmaceutical product.

### Usage (Tranexamic Acid)

Tranexamic acid is primarily used to control or prevent excessive bleeding. Its main applications include:

* **Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia):**  It reduces blood loss during menstruation.
* **Bleeding after surgery or trauma:** It helps to minimize bleeding complications.
* **Bleeding associated with certain medical conditions:** This might include dental procedures or conditions that cause easy bruising.

### Usage (Glutathione)

Glutathione is a naturally occurring antioxidant found in the body. While not approved by the FDA for specific medical conditions in the same way as Tranexamic Acid, it's used in some contexts to:

* **Support liver health:**  It helps the liver detoxify harmful substances.
* **Improve skin health:** Some believe it lightens skin tone and improves its overall appearance, though evidence for this is limited and not always conclusive.  More research is needed.
* **Boost the immune system:** It acts as an antioxidant, potentially reducing oxidative stress.

The combined use of Tranexamic Acid and Glutathione is sometimes explored in specific contexts, such as skin lightening treatments and treatments related to reducing oxidative stress associated with specific conditions, usually under the guidance of a qualified practitioner.  It's vital to note this is not a standard or approved medical practice in all cases.

### Dosage (Tranexamic Acid)

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the individual's weight, and the formulation (tablets, injection).  **Always follow a doctor's instructions.**  Generally:

* **Oral:**  The dosage for heavy menstrual bleeding can range from 1-1.5g several times daily.  Post-surgical bleeding dosages are determined by the surgeon.
* **Intravenous (IV):**  Dosage and administration are strictly determined by a medical professional based on the situation and severity of bleeding.


### Dosage (Glutathione)

Glutathione dosage varies depending on the form (oral, intravenous, topical) and the intended use.  Oral supplements often contain varying amounts of glutathione. Intravenous doses are determined by the physician.  **There is no standard, universally agreed-upon dosage for glutathione.**  The efficacy and safety of oral glutathione supplements are also subject to ongoing research and debate.

### Side Effects (Tranexamic Acid)

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Blood clots (very rare but serious), allergic reactions, seizures (rare).  Seek immediate medical attention if any of these occur.


### Side Effects (Glutathione)

Generally well-tolerated, but possible side effects (particularly with IV administration) may include:

* Nausea
