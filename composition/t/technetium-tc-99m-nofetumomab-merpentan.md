# Technetium Tc 99m Nofetumomab Merpentan
### Generic Name
Technetium Tc 99m Nofetumomab Merpentan

### Usage
Technetium Tc 99m nofetumomab merpentan is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily to detect the extent of disease in patients with pathologically confirmed, previously untreated small-cell lung cancer.  It aids in clinical staging by identifying the presence and location of cancerous growths.  This helps healthcare professionals determine the best course of treatment.


### Dosage
**Detection of extensive disease in small-cell lung cancer (Adults):** The typical intravenous dose is 5-10 mg of nofetumomab merpentan labeled with 1110 MBq (30 mCi) of Technetium Tc 99m, diluted in 15-20 mL of sodium chloride injection and administered over 3-5 minutes.  At least 15 mCi (555 MBq) of the final preparation should be given for optimal imaging.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Technetium Tc 99m nofetumomab merpentan have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment; however, caution is advised in patients with these conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Elevated amylase and lipase levels
* Transient allergic reactions
* Fever
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Anaphylactic reactions (rare but serious)

While rare, serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual symptoms after receiving this medication, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Technetium Tc 99m nofetumomab merpentan is a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab fragment) that targets a specific 40kD glycoprotein antigen found on various cancer cells, including those in small-cell lung cancer.  The Technetium Tc 99m acts as a radioactive tracer.  After injection, the antibody fragment binds to the antigen in cancer cells, allowing the location of these cells to be visualized using scintigraphy (nuclear imaging).  This imaging technique helps clinicians determine the extent of cancer spread.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Technetium Tc 99m nofetumomab merpentan is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medication, any products of murine origin (mouse-derived), or any of its components.

**Warnings:** There is an increased risk of accumulation of the medication in some patients.  

**Cautions:** Use with caution in patients who have received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and in those with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** This medication falls under Pregnancy Category C.  The excretion of the medication into breast milk is unknown. It's recommended to use infant formula instead of breast milk for at least 60-72 hours after administration.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Technetium Tc 99m nofetumomab merpentan administered?**
A: It's administered intravenously (IV).

**Q: How long does the imaging process take?**
A: The imaging procedure itself will take some time depending on the requirements and protocol of the imaging center.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual symptoms after receiving this medication.

**Q: How is the medication stored?**
A: The kit for preparing the medication should be stored at 2-8°C (36-46°F) and should not be frozen.  The prepared injection can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours.

**Q: Are there any special instructions after receiving the injection?**
A:  Voiding is encouraged after the injection to reduce bladder radiation doses.  Cathartics may also be used to reduce radiation exposure in the gastrointestinal tract.
