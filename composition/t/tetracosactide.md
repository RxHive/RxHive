# Tetracosactide
### Generic Name
Tetracosactide (Cosyntropin)

### Usage
Tetracosactide is primarily used as a diagnostic tool to assess the function of the adrenal glands.  Specifically, it's employed to screen for adrenal insufficiency, a condition where the adrenal glands don't produce enough cortisol.  This test involves administering tetracosactide and then measuring the body's response in terms of cortisol production.  A suboptimal response indicates potential adrenal insufficiency.  While not a treatment for adrenal insufficiency itself, the results guide further diagnostic steps and inform treatment decisions.


### Dosage

**Diagnostics for Adrenal Insufficiency:**

* **Adults:** 0.25-0.75 mg administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) over 2 minutes, diluted in normal saline (NS).  An alternative is a 0.25 mg IV infusion at 40 mcg/h over 6 hours for a more thorough adrenal gland stimulation.

* **Children:**
    * **Under 2 years:** 0.125 mg IV or IM over 2 minutes, diluted in NS.
    * **2 years and older:** Same dosage as adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare provider for guidance in these situations.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these effects is not clearly defined in available literature.

* Bradyarrhythmia (slow heart rhythm)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Tachycardia (fast heart rhythm)
* Rash
* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood)
* Periorbital edema (swelling around the eyes)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Adrenal hemorrhage (bleeding in the adrenal gland; more common with depot formulations)
* Behavioral syndrome


**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Tetracosactide is a synthetic analogue of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH naturally stimulates the adrenal cortex (outer layer of the adrenal gland) to produce cortisol, a vital hormone involved in various bodily functions, including stress response, metabolism, and immune function.  Tetracosactide mimics the action of ACTH. It binds to specific receptors on adrenal cortical cells, triggering a cascade of events leading to increased cortisol production. By measuring the subsequent rise in cortisol levels, healthcare providers can assess the adrenal gland's ability to respond appropriately to stimulation, thus aiding in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Tetracosactide is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetracosactide, synthetic ACTH, or any excipients (inactive ingredients).  Other contraindications include: asthma or other allergic conditions (increased risk of anaphylaxis), use in premature infants and neonates under 1 month old, acute psychosis, untreated infections (bacterial, fungal, viral), active or latent peptic ulcers, refractory heart failure, Cushing syndrome, primary adrenocortical insufficiency, and adrenogenital syndrome.

* **Warnings:**  Exercise caution in patients with GI disease, cardiovascular disease, hepatic disease, myasthenia gravis, ocular disease, psychiatric disturbances, osteoporosis, renal disease, thyroid disease, acute or chronic infections, latent tuberculosis, or those who have received live vaccines.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Tetracosactide is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is not definitively established. It's the recommended diagnostic test for primary adrenal insufficiency during pregnancy. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:** Bupropion (an antidepressant) can lower the seizure threshold when combined with systemic steroids (though this pertains to long-term corticosteroid use, not the single-dose diagnostic use of tetracosactide). Rotavirus infection and corticosteroids increase the risk of infection.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for tetracosactide to work?** A: The effects of tetracosactide are observed within a short time frame, typically within 30-60 minutes after administration, based on cortisol measurements.

* **Q: How is tetracosactide stored?** A: Storage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.

* **Q: Is tetracosactide safe?** A: When used as directed by a healthcare professional, tetracosactide is generally safe. However, as with any medication, there are potential side effects, some of which can be serious.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while using tetracosactide?** A: Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking, as they may interact with tetracosactide.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Tetracosactide is typically administered as a single dose during a diagnostic test.  Missing a dose in this context isn't relevant.  Consult your doctor if you have any concerns.
