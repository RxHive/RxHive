# Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab
### Generic Name
Technetium Tc 99m Fanolesomab

### Usage

Technetium Tc 99m fanolesomab is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily as a diagnostic imaging agent. Its main application was in the detection of appendicitis in patients presenting with ambiguous symptoms.  It was also explored for the detection of osteomyelitis and other infections.  However, it's crucial to note that this medication has been withdrawn from the market due to serious safety concerns (detailed below).


### Dosage

Because Technetium Tc 99m fanolesomab is no longer available, specific dosage information is not relevant for current medical practice.  Dosage information from previous prescribing guidelines would be obsolete and potentially misleading given the drug's withdrawal.


### Side Effects

While the primary reason for the withdrawal of Technetium Tc 99m fanolesomab from the market was the occurrence of serious adverse events, some previously reported side effects include:

* **Serious and Life-Threatening Cardiopulmonary Events:**  This included cardiac arrest, hypoxia, dyspnea, and hypotension, often occurring within minutes of administration.  This was the primary reason for the drug's removal from the market.

* **Other potential side effects (note: limited data due to market withdrawal):** The potential for other, less serious, side effects associated with this type of radiopharmaceutical existed, although specific data is limited due to the drug's removal.



### How it Works

Technetium Tc 99m fanolesomab is a radiopharmaceutical that utilizes a radioactive isotope of technetium (Tc 99m) attached to a monoclonal antibody (fanolesomab).  The antibody targets specific sites in the body, such as areas of inflammation associated with appendicitis or infection. The technetium-99m emits gamma rays, which can be detected by a specialized imaging device (gamma camera). This allows for visualization of the targeted areas, aiding in diagnosis.

### Precautions

**Contraindications and Warnings:**  The drug is no longer available due to the severe adverse cardiovascular events.  Any use of this medication is strongly contraindicated.

**Drug Interactions:**  Information regarding drug interactions is not relevant given the drug's unavailability.

**Special Populations (Pregnant women, children, elderly):**  Information on the use of this drug in special populations is unavailable because the drug is no longer marketed.

**Safety Measures:**  The most critical safety measure regarding Technetium Tc 99m fanolesomab is to avoid its use entirely, as it has been withdrawn from the market due to serious health risks.
