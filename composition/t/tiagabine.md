# Tiagabine
### Generic Name
Tiagabine

### Usage
Tiagabine is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in managing partial seizures.  This means it's used *in addition* to other anti-seizure medications, not as a standalone treatment.  It's approved for use in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  While its primary use is for partial seizures, it's crucial to understand that tiagabine is always part of a broader treatment plan determined by a neurologist or epileptologist.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Tiagabine should never be started with a loading dose, nor should the dose be increased rapidly or in large increments.  Dosage adjustments should always be made under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.

**Adults (Partial Seizures, Adjunctive Therapy):**

* **Initial Dose:** 4 mg once daily.
* **Dosage Increase:** The daily dose may be increased by 4-8 mg at weekly intervals until a satisfactory clinical response is observed.
* **Maximum Dose:** 56 mg/day.
* **Usual Maintenance Dose:** 32-56 mg/day, divided into 2-4 doses per day.
* **Patients on Enzyme-Inducing AEDs:** The starting dose and subsequent increases might need adjustments based on individual response and tolerance; this should be determined by a physician.


**Children (12-18 years, Partial Seizures, Adjunctive Therapy):**

* **Initial Dose:** 4 mg once daily.
* **Dosage Increase:**  After one week, the dose may be increased by 4 mg.  Further increases of 4-8 mg per week can be considered until an adequate response is seen.
* **Maximum Dose:** 32 mg/day, divided into 2-4 doses per day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  While official labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments, reduced doses might be necessary due to decreased clearance in patients with liver problems.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with kidney problems.


**Administration:** Tiagabine is usually administered orally, with or after a meal.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Dizziness

* Insomnia
* Confusion
* Status epilepticus (a prolonged seizure)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior

**If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above as serious, contact your doctor immediately.**  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.


### How it Works

Tiagabine works by increasing the amount of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) available in the brain. GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses, helping to reduce excessive neuronal activity that causes seizures.  Tiagabine achieves this by blocking the reuptake of GABA into nerve cells, allowing GABA to remain active in the synapses for a longer period.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Tiagabine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Suicidal Behavior/Ideation:**  Increased risk of suicidal thoughts or actions has been associated with anticonvulsants, including tiagabine.  Close monitoring, particularly in patients with a history of depression or suicidal tendencies, is crucial.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tiagabine's effects can be altered by other medications, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g., some antifungals, antibiotics, and other anticonvulsants).  Alcohol and other sedatives can increase sedation.  Valproate may increase tiagabine levels.  Consult your doctor about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use caution in patients with liver problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tiagabine is a Category C pregnancy drug, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully established.  It's generally recommended to use tiagabine during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. The excretion of tiagabine in breast milk is unknown, and breastfeeding mothers should discuss the risks and benefits with their physician.
* **Sudden Withdrawal:**  Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided as it may increase the frequency of seizures.  Withdrawal should be gradual, as directed by a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take tiagabine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're taking.  Some medications can interact with tiagabine, potentially altering its effectiveness or causing adverse effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the next dose if you miss one.  Contact your doctor for guidance on how to proceed.

* **Q: How should I store tiagabine?** A:  Store tiagabine as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking tiagabine?** A:  Because tiagabine can cause drowsiness, dizziness, or impaired concentration, it's best to avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of tiagabine?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential to assess its long-term effects and manage any potential issues.

* **Q:  Can tiagabine be used for other types of seizures?** A:  Currently, tiagabine is only approved for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in adults and children 12 years and older.
