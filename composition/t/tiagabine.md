# Tiagabine

**Generic Name:** Tiagabine

**Usage:** Tiagabine is used to treat partial seizures (seizures that affect only part of the brain) in adults.  It's often used as an add-on therapy, meaning it's taken in addition to other anti-seizure medications, not as a sole treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, tiagabine can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is a frequent side effect and can increase the risk of falls.
* **Headache:**  Often mild and manageable.
* **Tremor:** Shaking, usually in the hands.
* **Fatigue/Drowsiness:**  Can interfere with daily activities.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Vomiting:**  Throwing up.
* **Memory problems:** Difficulty remembering things.
* **Confusion:**  Disorientation or difficulty thinking clearly.
* **Drowsiness:**  Excessive sleepiness.
* **Weakness:**  Generalized feeling of weakness.
* **Weight loss:** Sometimes significant.
* **Vision changes:** Blurred vision or other visual disturbances.

**Serious side effects, although less common, include:**

* **Suicidal thoughts or actions:**  Immediate medical attention is required if these occur.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Symptoms such as rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing.
* **Severe dizziness or fainting:**  Can lead to falls and injuries.
* **Severe liver problems:**  Symptoms such as yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), dark urine, abdominal pain.


**How it Works:** Tiagabine works by blocking the reuptake of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) in the brain. GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses. By preventing GABA from being reabsorbed, tiagabine increases the amount of GABA available in the brain, thus reducing the excessive nerve activity that causes seizures.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take tiagabine with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur.  Some medications can significantly affect tiagabine's effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking tiagabine?** A:  Alcohol can worsen the drowsiness and dizziness caused by tiagabine.  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of tiagabine?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood, but consistent monitoring by your doctor is necessary.
* **Q: Can tiagabine be stopped suddenly?** A: No, tiagabine should be gradually withdrawn under the supervision of a doctor to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to increased seizure frequency or severity.
* **Q: Is tiagabine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  The safety of tiagabine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
