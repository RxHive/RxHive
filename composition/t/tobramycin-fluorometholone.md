# Tobramycin + Fluorometholone

**Generic Name:** Tobramycin and Fluorometholone Ophthalmic Suspension/Ointment

**Usage:**

This medication is an ophthalmic (eye) combination drug used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other bacterial infections of the eye that respond to tobramycin, accompanied by inflammation.  The tobramycin component is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that fights bacterial infections. Fluorometholone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling.  It's typically prescribed for short-term use to manage the infection and associated inflammation.  The specific conditions treated may vary depending on the formulation (suspension or ointment) and the doctor's assessment.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye(s) upon application.
* Eye irritation, redness, or itching.
* Blurred vision.
* Increased eye pressure (especially with prolonged use).
* Eyelid swelling.
* Headache.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).
* Secondary eye infections (due to suppression of normal immune response by the steroid).
* Increased risk of cataracts or glaucoma (with prolonged use).
* Thinning of the cornea (with prolonged use).


**How it Works:**

Tobramycin, the antibiotic component, works by interfering with the production of essential proteins in bacterial cells, leading to their death and stopping the infection. Fluorometholone, the corticosteroid, reduces inflammation by decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators in the eye.  Together, they combat both the infection and the associated swelling and discomfort.
