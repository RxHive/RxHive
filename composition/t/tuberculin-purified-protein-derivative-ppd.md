# Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD)
### Generic Name
Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD)

### Usage
Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) is primarily used as a diagnostic tool to detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis or TB).  The test doesn't distinguish between latent TB infection (LTBI), where the bacteria are present but not causing active disease, and active TB disease.  A positive PPD skin test indicates exposure to TB, but further testing is needed to confirm active disease.


### Dosage
The standard PPD test involves an intradermal injection of 5 tuberculin units (0.1 mL) in the forearm.  The same dosage applies to both adults and children over 6 months of age.  Infants under 6 months should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional.

The interpretation of the test result is crucial and isn't simply a yes/no answer. It depends on the size of the induration (hardened area) measured 48-72 hours after injection and the individual's risk factors for TB.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines provide detailed criteria for interpreting the test results, which vary based on risk factors such as:

* **HIV infection:**  A smaller induration size (≥5 mm) may be considered positive.
* **Recent close contact with active TB:** A smaller induration size (≥5 mm) may be considered positive.
* **Immunosuppression:** A smaller induration size (≥5 mm) may be considered positive.
* **High-risk groups (immigrants, IV drug users):**  An induration size of ≥10 mm may be considered positive.
* **Low-risk individuals:** An induration size of ≥15 mm may be considered positive.

A two-step test might be recommended in specific situations (e.g., healthcare workers undergoing regular testing).


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally localized to the injection site and can include:

* Injection site pain
* Swelling
* Redness
* Itching
* Small blisters (vesiculation)
*  Rarely, more serious side effects like:
    * Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
    * Angioedema
    * Skin ulceration at the injection site
    * Fever
    * Rash

If any significant or concerning side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
The PPD skin test is based on a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.  The PPD solution contains purified proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If a person has been previously exposed to TB, their immune system will react to these proteins. This reaction manifests as a visible area of induration at the injection site after 48-72 hours. The size of this induration helps determine the likelihood of TB infection.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  The PPD skin test is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to PPD or any component of the formulation.  It should also be avoided in people with a history of severe reaction to a previous PPD test or those with documented active TB.
* **Drug Interactions:** Live vaccines can interfere with the accuracy of the PPD test.  Avoid administering live vaccines within 4-6 weeks before or after a PPD test.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The PPD skin test is considered safe during pregnancy.  However, active TB infection poses significant risks to the fetus, and appropriate management is essential.  Information on excretion in breast milk is limited.
* **Other considerations:**  The test's accuracy can be affected by factors like other infections, immunosuppression, malnutrition, and certain medical conditions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to get the PPD test results?**
    * **A:** The test is read 48-72 hours after the injection.

* **Q: Is the PPD test painful?**
    * **A:** Most individuals experience only mild discomfort at the injection site.

* **Q: What should I do if I have a reaction at the injection site?**
    * **A:** Minor reactions are common.  However, if you experience severe symptoms such as widespread rash, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: Does a positive PPD test mean I have active TB?**
    * **A:** No, a positive test indicates exposure to TB but doesn't distinguish between latent and active TB. Further testing (such as chest X-ray and sputum culture) is needed to diagnose active TB disease.

* **Q: How is the PPD test stored?**
    * **A:**  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for storage.  Generally, PPD needs to be stored under refrigeration to maintain its potency.

* **Q: Can I get the PPD test while taking other medications?**
    * **A:** Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking, as some medications may affect the test results.
