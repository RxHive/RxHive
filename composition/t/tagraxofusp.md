# Tagraxofusp
### Generic Name
Tagraxofusp

### Usage
Tagraxofusp is a targeted cancer therapy used primarily to treat blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) in adults and children aged 2 years and older.  BPDCN is a rare and aggressive type of blood cancer.  Currently, Tagraxofusp is approved specifically for this indication.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Before the first dose of each cycle, a serum albumin level of ≥3.2 g/dL is required.  Albumin levels should be monitored before each dose and as clinically indicated. Premedication with an H1-antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine), an H2-antagonist, a corticosteroid (e.g., 50 mg IV methylprednisolone or equivalent), and acetaminophen approximately 60 minutes before each Tagraxofusp infusion is crucial.

**Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm:**

* **Adults and Children ≥2 years:** The intravenous (IV) dose is 12 mcg/kg daily on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  The dosing period may be extended for dose delays up to day 10 of the cycle.  Cycle 1 should be administered in an inpatient setting with at least 24 hours of observation post-infusion. Subsequent cycles may be administered in inpatient or outpatient settings (if appropriate) with at least 4 hours of post-infusion observation.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors including:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  For severe hepatic impairment, no guidance is available in the manufacturer’s labeling.  If elevated liver enzymes (AST or ALT >5 times ULN) occur, Tagraxofusp should be withheld until levels decrease to ≤2.5 times ULN.

* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for mild or moderate renal impairment. For severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²), no specific guidance is available in the manufacturer’s labeling. If serum creatinine levels increase above 1.8 mg/dL or creatinine clearance (CrCl) falls below 60 mL/min, Tagraxofusp should be withheld until these values return to acceptable levels.

* **Toxicity Management:** Dosage interruptions or discontinuations may be required based on the development of capillary leak syndrome (CLS), cardiac effects, hypersensitivity reactions, and pyrexia (fever). Specific guidelines for managing these toxicities are detailed in the prescribing information.

### How it Works

Tagraxofusp is a targeted therapy that works by binding to CD123, a protein found on the surface of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cells.  This fusion protein consists of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and a modified diphtheria toxin. The IL-3 component helps Tagraxofusp bind to the CD123 receptor, while the diphtheria toxin component enters the cancer cell and inhibits protein synthesis, leading to cell death.  This selective targeting aims to minimize harm to healthy cells.


### Precautions

* **Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS):**  CLS is a serious and potentially life-threatening side effect. Close monitoring for symptoms such as weight gain, edema, hypotension, and hemodynamic instability is crucial.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Hypersensitivity reactions can range from mild to life-threatening.  Appropriate monitoring and management strategies are essential.
* **Hepatotoxicity:**  Liver function should be closely monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Tagraxofusp can harm a developing fetus. Effective contraception is required during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Tagraxofusp may interact with other medications.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Tagraxofusp administered?** A: Tagraxofusp is administered intravenously (IV) via an infusion pump.

* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

* **Q: How is Tagraxofusp stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.
