# Tavaborole
### Generic Name
Tavaborole

### Usage
Tavaborole is an antifungal medication used topically to treat onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toenails) caused by *Trichophyton rubrum* or *Trichophyton mentagrophytes*.  It's specifically designed for toenail infections and is not effective for fingernail onychomycosis or other fungal infections.

### Dosage
**Onychomycosis (Toenail Fungus):**

* **Adults and children aged 6 years and older:** Apply a 5% solution of tavaborole once daily (OD) to the affected toenail(s) for 48 weeks (approximately one year).  The solution should completely cover the affected toenail surface, including under the tip.  Excess solution should be wiped away from surrounding skin.  Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Adjustments may not be necessary due to the low systemic absorption of tavaborole.

### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Ingrown nail, local skin exfoliation, application-site erythema (redness), and application-site dermatitis (inflammation of the skin).
* **Less Common (<1%, Post-marketing reports):** Allergic contact dermatitis.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially persistent irritation, redness, exfoliation, or dermatitis, discontinue use and consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Tavaborole is an oxaborole antifungalâ€”a boron-containing compound.  It works by inhibiting protein synthesis within the fungal cells. This inhibition occurs by blocking the action of an aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase (AARS), an enzyme crucial for fungal growth and survival. By disrupting this process, tavaborole effectively prevents the fungus from reproducing and allows the nail to heal.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of persistent local irritation, erythema (redness), exfoliation (peeling), or dermatitis (skin inflammation).
* **Use with caution:**  In breastfeeding women, as excretion in breast milk is unknown.  The potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks before use during breastfeeding.
* **General Considerations:**  Apply the solution to completely cover the affected toenail surface, including under the tip. Avoid contact with skin other than the skin immediately surrounding the treated toenails. Wipe away excess solution and allow it to dry. Wash hands after each application.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**  A: Improvement in the signs and symptoms of onychomycosis may take several months, and treatment typically lasts 48 weeks.  Consistent application is crucial for effectiveness.

* **Q: Can I use tavaborole on my fingernails?** A: No, tavaborole is only indicated for toenail onychomycosis caused by *Trichophyton rubrum* or *Trichophyton mentagrophytes*.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store tavaborole?** A: Store tavaborole at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Refer to the product label for specific storage instructions.

* **Q: Is tavaborole safe for pregnant women?** A:  Tavaborole is classified as Pregnancy Category C. This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The drug should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Always consult your doctor before using any medication during pregnancy.
