# Trioxsalen
### Generic Name
Trioxsalen

### Usage
Trioxsalen is a medication primarily used in combination with ultraviolet A (UVA) light therapy to treat vitiligo, a condition characterized by patches of skin losing their pigment.  This combination therapy, often referred to as PUVA (psoralen plus UVA) therapy, aims to stimulate pigment production in the affected areas.  Trioxsalen itself is inactive until exposed to UVA light, at which point it becomes active and interacts with skin cells.  It's also sometimes used to increase the skin's tolerance to sunlight and improve skin pigmentation in other conditions, although this is a less common application.

### Dosage

**Vitiligo (Oral):**  The typical adult dose is 20-40 mg taken 2-4 hours before planned UVA light exposure. Treatment sessions are usually two or three times per week, with at least 48 hours between sessions.  Children over 12 years old typically receive the same adult dosage.

**Increasing Sun Tolerance and Pigmentation (Oral):** For this purpose, the dose is also 20-40 mg, taken 2 hours before UVA exposure, two or three times a week (minimum 48 hours apart).  Importantly, this treatment is usually limited to a maximum of 14 days, whether continuous or interrupted, as adequate pigmentation should develop within that timeframe. Children over 12 years old follow the same regimen.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any organ problems.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nausea
* Itching (pruritus)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Edema (swelling)
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Depression
* Hypopigmentation (loss of skin color)
* Bullae formation (blistering)
* Rash
* Herpes simplex (cold sores)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Gastrointestinal disturbances
* Leg cramps
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Worsening of psoriasis

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the less common ones, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Trioxsalen is a photosensitizing drug. It's inactive until exposed to UVA light. When activated by UVA, it interacts with the DNA of skin cells, influencing cell growth and potentially stimulating pigment production.  The precise mechanisms are complex, but the result is an increase in melanin production (the pigment responsible for skin color), aiming to reduce the appearance of vitiligo patches.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Trioxsalen is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to trioxsalen or related compounds.
* Porphyria (a group of inherited disorders affecting the production of heme).
* Acute autoimmune diseases.
* Children under 12 years old.


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) with long-term use.  
* Use with caution in patients with basal cell carcinoma or cardiovascular disease.
* Trioxsalen should be taken with food or milk.
* Avoid foods containing furocoumarins (e.g., limes, figs, parsley, celery, etc.) during treatment.
* Exposure to sunlight or UVA radiation should be carefully controlled and protected against. Protective clothing, eyewear, and sunscreen are recommended for 24 hours after treatment to minimize risk of sunburn and other adverse effects.  


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Trioxsalen is categorized as Pregnancy Category C (potential risks to the fetus). Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, so use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision.

**Drug Interactions:** Trioxsalen can interact with numerous other medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 enzymes.  Consultation with a doctor or pharmacist is crucial if you are taking other medications. The interactions listed in the provided data should be considered in detail before commencing treatment.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see results with trioxsalen and UVA therapy?**
A: The response to treatment varies between individuals. Results may be visible after several weeks or months of consistent therapy.

**Q: How should I store trioxsalen?**
A: Store trioxsalen as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Is trioxsalen safe for long-term use?**
A: Long-term use of trioxsalen and UVA therapy carries an increased risk of skin cancer.  Treatment should be carefully monitored by a dermatologist.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on how to proceed if you miss a dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: Can I use sunscreen after trioxsalen treatment?**
A: Sunscreen is generally recommended *after* the treatment session to protect the skin from further sun exposure.  However, it's crucial to follow the guidance provided by your dermatologist.
