# Tolciclate
### Generic Name
Tolciclate

### Usage
Tolciclate is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat fungal skin infections caused by dermatophytes.  These infections commonly affect the skin, hair, and nails and are often referred to as tinea infections.  Specific dermatophytes targeted by tolciclate include species of *Epidermophyton*, *Microsporum*, and *Trichophyton*.  It's important to note that tolciclate is no longer widely available or marketed in many regions.

### Dosage
Because tolciclate is no longer commonly available, specific dosage information is difficult to provide definitively.  Dosage would have varied depending on the formulation (e.g., cream, ointment, solution), the affected area, and the severity of the infection.  If you are considering using a pre-existing tolciclate medication, refer to the original product labeling for precise instructions, or consult a healthcare professional.  Never use medication without consulting a doctor, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are taking other medications.

### Side Effects
Since tolciclate is not currently in widespread use, comprehensive data on side effects is limited. However, potential side effects common with topical antifungal agents might include:

* Local skin irritation (redness, itching, burning)
* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Swelling at the application site


Serious side effects are rare with topical antifungal applications.  However, if any severe reaction occurs (e.g., widespread rash, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Tolciclate works by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  Specifically, it inhibits squalene epoxidase, an enzyme crucial in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. By disrupting ergosterol production, tolciclate disrupts the fungal cell membrane's integrity, leading to cell death and inhibiting the fungus's growth and spread.

### Precautions
Due to limited current availability and data, specific precautions are challenging to definitively list.  However, some general precautions for topical antifungal medications apply and should be considered if tolciclate is encountered:

* **Allergy:** Avoid using tolciclate if you have a known allergy to it or any related antifungal agents.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult a doctor before using tolciclate during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The safety of topical antifungal medications during these periods isn't fully established for all products.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking to check for potential interactions.
* **Wounds:** Avoid applying tolciclate to open wounds or severely damaged skin.
* **Children:**  Use only as directed by a doctor. The dosage and safety in children might not be fully established for tolciclate.
