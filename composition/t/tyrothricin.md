# Tyrothricin
### Generic Name
Tyrothricin

### Usage

Tyrothricin is a topical antibiotic used to treat infections of the skin and mucous membranes caused by susceptible bacteria and fungi.  It's primarily used for superficial infections, meaning those affecting only the outer layers of the skin or the surface of mucous membranes.  It is *not* suitable for internal use due to its toxicity.  Common applications include treating minor cuts, abrasions, burns (minor), and some mouth or throat infections.  It's often found in throat sprays, mouthwashes, and topical ointments. Note that its effectiveness is limited to gram-positive bacteria and certain fungi; it won't work against all types of infections.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., spray, ointment, mouthwash) and the affected area.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or by your healthcare provider.  There are no standardized dosages for children or adults as the application is always topical and the amount used is dependent on the size and location of the affected area.  Self-treating should only be attempted for minor infections. For more serious or extensive infections, consult a doctor.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Mild burning or stinging sensation at the application site.  This usually subsides quickly.
* **Less Common but Important:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), irritation, dryness, or redness of the skin.  In rare cases, prolonged use, especially in nasal sprays, has been linked to a loss of sense of smell.
* **Serious (Rare):** Although uncommon with topical use, systemic absorption can lead to more serious side effects such as kidney or liver damage.  This is extremely rare with proper topical application.  Immediately seek medical attention if you experience any unusual symptoms.


### How it Works

Tyrothricin is a mixture of two cyclic polypeptide antibiotics, tyrocidine and gramicidin.  These peptides work by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and some fungi.  By damaging the cell membrane, they cause leakage of essential cell components, leading to the death of the microorganisms. This action is specific to the cell membranes of bacteria and fungi and does not affect human cells in a similar way,  explaining why it's only effective topically.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Tyrothricin should not be swallowed or used internally. Do not use it if you are allergic to any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently documented for topical use.
* **Specific Warnings:** Avoid contact with eyes.  If accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using tyrothricin.  Children should only use it under adult supervision.  Do not use this medication for longer than recommended without consulting a healthcare professional. Prolonged use can lead to the development of resistant bacteria.
