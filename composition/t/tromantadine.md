# Tromantadine
### Generic Name
Tromantadine

### Usage
Tromantadine is a topical antiviral medication primarily used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections affecting the skin and mucous membranes.  This includes both oral and genital herpes, but only in the early stages of the infection, *before* blisters (vesicles) have formed or broken.  It's crucial to understand that tromamtadine is not a cure for HSV, but rather helps to manage symptoms and potentially shorten the duration of the outbreak.  It is not effective against other types of herpes viruses.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For herpes simplex infections of the skin and mucous membranes, the usual dose is a 1% gel applied 3-5 times daily, or more frequently as needed.  The gel should be gently rubbed into the affected area.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of tromamtadine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Contact dermatitis (skin inflammation or rash at the application site)

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual symptoms, discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works
Tromantadine is an antiviral agent that inhibits herpes simplex virus replication. It achieves this by interfering with the virus's ability to penetrate host cells and replicate.  Specifically, it alters the glycoproteins on the surface of host cells, preventing the virus from effectively entering and infecting them.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Tromantadine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to tromamtadine or parabens (a preservative often found in topical medications).
* **Drug Interactions:** There is limited information on drug interactions with tromamtadine.  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Tromantadine may be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Whether tromamtadine is excreted in breast milk is unknown. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.
* **General Precautions:**  Discontinue use if no improvement is seen within two days of starting treatment.  Do not use tromamtadine once blisters have formed or ruptured.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Improvement may be seen within a few days, but the duration of treatment may vary depending on the severity of the infection.
* **Q: Can I use this medication on open sores or broken skin?** A: No. Tromantadine should only be applied to intact skin.  Avoid applying it to open sores or broken skin to prevent further irritation or infection.
* **Q: How should I store tromamtadine?** A: Store tromamtadine at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular dosing schedule.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I use tromamtadine to prevent future outbreaks?** A: No, tromamtadine is for treating existing outbreaks, not for preventing future ones.  Talk to your doctor about other options for managing recurrent herpes outbreaks.
