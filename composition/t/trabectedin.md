# Trabectedin
### Generic Name
Trabectedin

### Usage

Trabectedin is primarily used to treat adults with unresectable (cannot be surgically removed) or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body) soft tissue sarcoma.  Specifically, it's indicated for liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma in patients who have already received treatment with an anthracycline-containing regimen (a type of chemotherapy).  While not officially approved for this purpose, trabectedin is sometimes used off-label in combination with liposomal doxorubicin for treating relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.  This off-label use should only be considered under the guidance of an oncologist experienced in managing ovarian cancer.

### Dosage

**Liposarcoma or Leiomyosarcoma (Adult):** The standard dose is 1.5 mg/m² administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion over 24 hours, once every 3 weeks. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  Before each treatment cycle, several blood tests are required to ensure that the patient's blood counts (ANC, platelets) and liver function tests (bilirubin, ALP, ALT, AST, CPK) are within acceptable ranges.  Dexamethasone (20 mg IV) is given 30 minutes before each trabectedin infusion.

**Ovarian Cancer (Adult, Off-Label Use):** When used in combination with liposomal doxorubicin, the dose is typically 1.1 mg/m² IV over 3 hours every 3 weeks.  Dosage adjustments are frequently needed based on tolerability and response. The treatment continues as long as it's beneficial or until disease progression.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of trabectedin in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors including liver and kidney function, and the severity of side effects.  Specific adjustments depend on the type and severity of the adverse reaction and are detailed in the prescribing information.  For example, reduced doses are typically recommended for patients with mild to moderate liver impairment.  Severe liver impairment necessitates discontinuation of the drug.  Renal impairment may also require dosage modification, though specifics aren't directly provided in the prescribing information.  Obese patients might also need dosage adjustments; this should be decided on a case-by-case basis under the guidance of a medical professional, adhering to guidelines provided by organizations such as ASCO.

### How it Works

Trabectedin is an alkylating agent derived from a marine organism.  It works by binding to the DNA's minor groove, causing a bend in the DNA helix. This interferes with the activity of several DNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, and DNA repair mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell death, particularly in cancer cells.  It primarily stops the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, preventing cancer cell division and growth.

### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Trabectedin is contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
*   **Infection:**  Patients with active, serious, or uncontrolled infections should not receive trabectedin.
*   **Pregnancy:** Trabectedin is harmful to a developing fetus.  Women of reproductive potential must use effective contraception during and for at least two months after treatment. Pregnancy should be ruled out before starting trabectedin.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  Trabectedin is contraindicated in breastfeeding women.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Trabectedin's metabolism is affected by CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) and inducers (e.g., rifampin). Concomitant use should be avoided unless under strict medical supervision and with necessary dose adjustments.
*   **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Trabectedin can cause significant bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Regular blood monitoring is crucial.
*   **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Trabectedin is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted through the kidneys.  Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function is necessary. Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.
*   **Cardiotoxicity:**  Trabectedin can cause cardiomyopathy.  Cardiac function monitoring (e.g., LVEF) is recommended before and during treatment.
*   **Extravasation:** Trabectedin is a vesicant; extravasation (leakage from the vein) can cause severe tissue damage.  Careful administration through a central line is essential.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is trabectedin administered?** A: Trabectedin is administered intravenously (IV) via a central line. The infusion time varies depending on the treatment indication (24 hours or 3 hours).

*   **Q: How long does treatment with trabectedin last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the patient's response to therapy and the occurrence of side effects. It usually continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately. Some side effects may require dosage adjustments or treatment discontinuation.

*   **Q: How should trabectedin be stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication. Typically, it requires refrigeration.

*   **Q:  Can I take other medications while on trabectedin?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as there's a potential for drug interactions.

*   **Q: Is trabectedin suitable for everyone with sarcoma?** A: No. Trabectedin is indicated only for specific types of sarcoma and only after other treatments have been tried.  Your oncologist will determine if it's the appropriate treatment for you.
