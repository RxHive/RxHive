# Tapinarof
### Generic Name
Tapinarof

### Usage
Tapinarof is a topical medication primarily used to treat plaque psoriasis in adults.  It's applied directly to the affected skin areas to reduce the inflammation and scaling characteristic of this chronic skin condition. Currently, its use is limited to adults; it hasn't been tested for efficacy or safety in children.

### Dosage
**Adults (Plaque Psoriasis):**  The recommended dosage is one application daily (OD) of a thin layer of Tapinarof 1% cream to the affected areas of skin.  Only apply to the psoriatic lesions; avoid applying to unaffected skin.  Wash hands after application unless treating the hands themselves.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Tapinarof in children have not been established, and therefore, its use in pediatric patients is not recommended.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are necessary based on hepatic or renal impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.  However, always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, particularly if you have pre-existing liver or kidney conditions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include infections such as folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles) and nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat), often manifesting as nasal congestion, pharyngitis (sore throat), or other respiratory symptoms.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include headache (including migraine and tension headaches), influenza (flu), contact dermatitis (skin inflammation from contact with an irritant), and pruritus (itching).

Less common, but potentially serious side effects might occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, immediately discontinue use and contact your doctor.


### How it Works
Tapinarof is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist. While the precise mechanisms by which it treats psoriasis aren't fully understood, it's believed to work by modulating the activity of the AhR, a protein involved in regulating immune responses and skin cell growth. By influencing AhR, Tapinarof helps to reduce the inflammation and abnormal cell growth that characterize plaque psoriasis.
