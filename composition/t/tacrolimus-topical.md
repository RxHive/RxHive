# Tacrolimus (Topical)
### Generic Name
Tacrolimus (Topical)

### Usage
Tacrolimus topical ointment is primarily used as a second-line treatment for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults and children (aged 2 years and older) who haven't responded well to standard treatments or for whom those treatments aren't suitable.  It's a short-term, non-continuous treatment option for this chronic condition.  Importantly, it's not a first-line treatment.

While the primary indication is for atopic dermatitis, tacrolimus topical is also used off-label for several other skin conditions, including oral lichen planus, vitiligo, pyoderma gangrenosum, and psoriasis.  However, its effectiveness and safety for these off-label uses haven't been as extensively studied as for atopic dermatitis.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before using tacrolimus for any condition other than atopic dermatitis.

### Dosage

**Atopic Dermatitis (Moderate-to-Severe):**

* **Adults and Adolescents (≥16 years):**  0.1% ointment is typically applied as a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily (BID). Rub it in gently and completely.
* **Children (2-15 years):** 0.03% ointment is usually applied as a thin layer to affected areas twice daily (BID).  Rub it in gently and completely.

For all age groups, treatment should stop once symptoms clear.  If there's no improvement after six weeks, a doctor should re-evaluate the diagnosis and treatment plan.

**Off-Label Uses:** Dosages for off-label uses vary considerably and are not standardized.  These dosages are based on available clinical evidence but may not represent the most current best practice. A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage and monitoring plan for off-label uses. Examples include:

* **Oral Lichen Planus:** 0.1% ointment, applied thinly up to four times a day (QID) for 4-6 weeks.
* **Vitiligo:** 0.1% ointment, applied twice daily (BID) for several months (10 weeks to 18 months).
* **Pyoderma Gangrenosum:** 0.03% or 0.1% ointment, applied once daily (OD) for up to 10 weeks.
* **Psoriasis:** 0.1% ointment, applied twice daily (BID) for 8 weeks.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Burning sensation of the skin
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin redness (erythema)
* Skin infections
* Headache


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma (particularly with long-term use)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Tacrolimus topical is a calcineurin inhibitor.  Calcineurin is an enzyme involved in the activation of T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell crucial in the immune response. By inhibiting calcineurin, tacrolimus reduces the activity of T-lymphocytes, thus suppressing the inflammatory response that contributes to atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory skin conditions. The exact mechanism of action in atopic dermatitis isn't fully understood, but the immunosuppressive effect plays a key role.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tacrolimus topical is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Avoid concomitant use with certain medications like cyclosporine (systemic), other immunosuppressants, sirolimus, and temsirolimus.  Many other drugs may interact with tacrolimus, affecting its effectiveness or causing adverse effects. Consult a healthcare professional about all medications and supplements you're taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Tacrolimus is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  It's excreted in breast milk, so a decision on whether to discontinue breastfeeding or the medication should be made carefully, weighing the risks and benefits.
* **Children:**  Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment is approved for children aged 2 years and older. Tacrolimus topical is not approved for use in children under 2 years.
* **Immunocompromised Patients:**  Tacrolimus topical should not be used in immunocompromised patients due to the increased risk of infections.
* **Long-Term Use:**  Avoid prolonged or continuous use, as this increases the risk of malignancy.  Limit application to affected areas.
* **Sun Exposure:** Limit sun exposure during treatment.
