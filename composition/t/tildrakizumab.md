# Tildrakizumab
### Generic Name
Tildrakizumab

### Usage
Tildrakizumab is a prescription medication used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.  It's specifically indicated for individuals who are candidates for systemic therapy (like methotrexate or biologics) or phototherapy (light treatment).  The primary use is to alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis, such as raised, red, scaly patches on the skin.  Currently, it is not approved for other conditions.

### Dosage
Tildrakizumab is administered as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.  The typical dosage for adults with plaque psoriasis is 100 mg.  The injection schedule is as follows:  100 mg at week 0, another 100 mg at week 4, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.  This dosing regimen applies regardless of body weight or the severity of the psoriasis.  There is currently no approved dosage for children under 18 years of age.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions for administration.

### How it Works
Tildrakizumab is a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody. It works by targeting and blocking a protein in the body called interleukin-23 (IL-23).  IL-23 is a cytokine, a signaling molecule that plays a significant role in inflammation. In people with psoriasis, IL-23 is overactive, contributing to the excessive skin cell growth and inflammation characteristic of the disease. By blocking IL-23, tildrakizumab helps to reduce inflammation and slow down the overproduction of skin cells, thus improving the symptoms of psoriasis.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Tildrakizumab is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to tildrakizumab or any of its components.

**Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with live vaccines; there is insufficient data on the response to live or inactive vaccines while using Tildrakizumab.

**Warnings:**

* **Increased risk of infection:**  Tildrakizumab weakens the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.  Before starting treatment, ensure you are up-to-date with all recommended immunizations.
* **Tuberculosis (TB):**  Patients should be screened for TB before starting tildrakizumab.  Treatment for latent TB should be completed before initiating tildrakizumab therapy.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of tildrakizumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully understood and requires discussion with your physician.  Appropriate contraception should be used.
