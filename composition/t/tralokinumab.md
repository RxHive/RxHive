# Tralokinumab
### Generic Name
Tralokinumab

### Usage
Tralokinumab is a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults.  It's specifically indicated for those whose condition isn't adequately controlled with topical prescription treatments, or when such treatments aren't advisable.  This means it's generally used when other, less potent treatments haven't worked well enough.  It's not a first-line treatment for mild eczema.

### Dosage
Tralokinumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection.  The typical dosage regimen for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis starts with a 600 mg dose (given as four 150 mg injections) once, followed by 300 mg (two 150 mg injections) every other week.  For patients weighing less than 100 kg who achieve clear or almost clear skin after 16 weeks, the dose may be reduced to 300 mg every 4 weeks.  

**Important Note:**  Before starting tralokinumab, any pre-existing helminth (worm) infections should be treated, and all age-appropriate immunizations should be completed. Live vaccines should be avoided during treatment. Tralokinumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  The safety and effectiveness of tralokinumab in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include upper respiratory tract infections.

Side effects affecting 1-10% of patients include:

*   Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
*   Injection site reactions
*   Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eye)
*   Keratoconjunctivitis (inflammation of both the cornea and conjunctiva)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea, potentially leading to vision problems) including atopic keratoconjunctivitis and ulcerative keratitis.
*   Hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) and angioedema (swelling under the skin).
*   Development of antibodies against tralokinumab.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Tralokinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-13 (IL-13), a protein involved in the inflammatory response associated with atopic dermatitis. By binding to IL-13 and blocking its interaction with its receptors, tralokinumab inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and IgE, thus reducing the inflammation and symptoms of eczema.  In simpler terms, it works by reducing the body's inflammatory response that causes the symptoms of atopic dermatitis.

### Precautions
Tralokinumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to tralokinumab or any component of its formulation.  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema), conjunctivitis and keratitis, and infections if live vaccines are administered concurrently.  The use of tralokinumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.  While it is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody and human IgG crosses the placenta, excretion in breast milk is unknown.  The drug may diminish the therapeutic effect of efgartigimod alfa.
