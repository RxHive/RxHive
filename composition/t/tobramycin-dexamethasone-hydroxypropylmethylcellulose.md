# Tobramycin + Dexamethasone + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Tobramycin/Dexamethasone/Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose Ophthalmic Solution


**Usage:**

This combination ophthalmic solution is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other bacterial infections of the eye that respond to tobramycin, accompanied by inflammation.  The tobramycin combats the bacterial infection, dexamethasone reduces inflammation and swelling, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acts as a lubricant and helps prolong the contact time of the medication with the eye.  It's typically prescribed for short-term use, as directed by a physician.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can occur locally in the eye and, less commonly, systemically.  These may include:

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or irritation of the eye; temporary blurry vision; eye redness; increased eye pressure.
* **Less Common:** Headache, eye discharge, eye pain, allergic reactions (itching, swelling, rash).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Development of fungal or viral eye infections (secondary infections), increased intraocular pressure (potentially leading to glaucoma), cataracts, delayed wound healing.  Systemic side effects from absorption of tobramycin are unlikely with ophthalmic use but are possible, particularly in children and those with kidney problems.  These could include hearing loss, kidney damage, and nerve problems.

**How it Works:**

* **Tobramycin:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells, ultimately killing them. It's effective against a range of Gram-negative bacteria commonly causing eye infections.
* **Dexamethasone:** A corticosteroid, dexamethasone reduces inflammation and swelling by suppressing the immune system's response in the eye. This helps to alleviate discomfort and promote healing.
* **Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose:** This is a viscosity-increasing agent.  It thickens the solution, allowing it to stay in contact with the eye longer, improving the delivery and effectiveness of the tobramycin and dexamethasone.
