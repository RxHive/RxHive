# Tobramycin + Dexamethasone + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
### Generic Name
Tobramycin + Dexamethasone + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) in adults and children.  It's a topical ophthalmic solution, meaning it's applied directly to the eye. Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that effectively combats various bacterial infections. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) acts as a viscosity-increasing agent, helping the medication stay in contact with the eye for longer and improving its effectiveness.  While primarily for bacterial conjunctivitis, it may sometimes be prescribed for other inflammatory eye conditions where a bacterial infection is suspected or present, though this should always be under a doctor's direct supervision.  This is not a treatment for viral or fungal infections.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation and the doctor's prescription.  Generally, for adults and children (as prescribed by a physician), the typical recommendation is one or two drops in the affected eye(s) every four to six hours.  Always follow the instructions provided on the medication label and by your doctor.  **Never exceed the prescribed dosage.**  There aren't separate oral or IV formulations; this medication is exclusively for topical ophthalmic use.  Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Burning or stinging sensation in the eye upon application, temporary blurred vision, eye irritation.
* **Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** Increased eye pressure (glaucoma), eye infections, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), visual disturbances.
* **Note:**  If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, such as severe eye pain, vision changes, or allergic reactions, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

This combination medication works through a two-pronged approach:

* **Tobramycin:** This antibiotic targets and kills susceptible bacteria causing the infection.  It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, effectively halting their growth and reproduction.

* **Dexamethasone:** This corticosteroid reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye. It works by suppressing the body's inflammatory response, thus alleviating symptoms like redness, swelling, and discomfort.

* **Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC):** This acts as a thickening agent, extending the medication's contact time with the eye's surface and improving its therapeutic effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you are allergic to any of its components (tobramycin, dexamethasone, or HPMC).  Pre-existing glaucoma should be carefully evaluated before using this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements.  Some medications may interact with this combination.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Children:** Use in children should only occur under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional who can assess the child's needs and monitor for any potential adverse effects.

* **Contact Lens Use:** Remove contact lenses before applying the medication and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

* **Storage:** Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.


### FAQs
