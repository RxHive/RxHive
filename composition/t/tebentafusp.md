# Tebentafusp
### Generic Name
Tebentafusp

### Usage
Tebentafusp is a targeted cancer therapy specifically indicated for treating unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma in adults who are positive for the HLA-A*02:01 gene.  Uveal melanoma is a rare type of cancer that originates in the uvea, the middle layer of the eye.  This treatment is not suitable for all uveal melanoma patients; it's crucial to confirm HLA-A*02:01 positivity through genetic testing before considering this medication.  Currently, there are no approved uses of Tebentafusp outside of this specific indication.

### Dosage
The dosage regimen for adults with HLA-A*02:01-positive unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma involves intravenous (IV) administration.  The initial doses are carefully escalated: 20 mcg on Day 1, 30 mcg on Day 8, and 68 mcg on Day 15.  Following this, a maintenance dose of 68 mcg is given once weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  

The first three infusions must be administered in a healthcare setting equipped to manage potential adverse events, with close monitoring during and for at least 16 hours after the infusion.  Subsequent infusions may be administered in an ambulatory setting if the patient tolerates the first three without Grade 2 or worse hypotension requiring medical intervention.  Monitoring for at least 30 minutes post-infusion is still necessary for subsequent doses.  

There is no established dosage for pediatric patients.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment aren't explicitly defined in the labeling but should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  Specific adjustments are made based on the severity of adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome, skin reactions, and elevated liver enzymes (see Dosage Adjustments section below).

### Side Effects
Common side effects reported include:

*   Chills
*   Dizziness
*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
*   Edema (swelling)
*   Flushing
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*   Flu-like symptoms
*   Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
*   Alopecia (hair loss)
*   Skin rash, erythema (redness), hyperpigmentation (darkening), or hypopigmentation (lightening)
*   Night sweats
*   Pruritus (itching)
*   Xeroderma (dry skin)
*   Abdominal pain
*   Constipation
*   Decreased appetite
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Decreased hemoglobin, neutrophil, lymphocyte, or platelet counts
*   Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin)
*   Increased serum creatinine
*   Fever

Less frequent but more serious side effects include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can be life-threatening, skin reactions that require medical intervention, and hepatotoxicity (liver damage).  Anaphylaxis is also a possibility.  If any adverse effect occurs, particularly severe ones, it’s crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Tebentafusp is a bispecific T-cell engager. This means it acts as a bridge between the immune system’s T cells and cancer cells.  One arm of the molecule binds to a specific protein (gp100) found on the surface of uveal melanoma cells that also present the HLA-A*02:01 molecule. The other arm binds to CD3, a protein on T cells. This binding brings the T cells into close proximity to the cancer cells, activating the T cells to attack and destroy the melanoma cells.  The destruction involves the release of inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic proteins from the activated T-cells.

### Precautions
*   **HLA-A*02:01 Status:**  Tebentafusp is only effective in patients with HLA-A*02:01-positive uveal melanoma.  Genetic testing is mandatory before treatment.
*   **Pregnancy:** Tebentafusp can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and for one week after treatment.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose due to the potential for harm to the infant.
*   **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** CRS is a potentially life-threatening side effect.  Close monitoring is essential, particularly during the initial infusions.  Treatment with corticosteroids might be necessary.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Although specific dosage adjustments aren't provided, these conditions should be carefully considered.
*   **Drug Interactions:** While no significant interactions are currently known, it's vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Tebentafusp administered?** A: It is administered intravenously (IV).
*   **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately, especially if you experience severe side effects.
*   **Q: How is Tebentafusp stored?** A:  Refer to the medication packaging for specific storage instructions, but generally it involves refrigeration.
*   **Q:  Is Tebentafusp suitable for everyone with uveal melanoma?** A: No, only patients with HLA-A*02:01 positive uveal melanoma are eligible for this treatment.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are primarily managed based on the severity of adverse events.  For example, Grade 3 or 4 elevations in liver enzymes (ALT/AST) may require holding the medication until levels return to normal or Grade 1.  Resuming the dose depends on the context (i.e., if associated with Grade 3 CRS or not). Similarly, significant skin reactions or severe CRS necessitate dose modifications or discontinuation.  Consult with a healthcare professional for specific adjustments.  This information is for educational purposes and does not constitute medical advice.
