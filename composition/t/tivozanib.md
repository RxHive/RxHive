# Tivozanib
### Generic Name
Tivozanib

### Usage
Tivozanib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat adults with relapsed or refractory (meaning the cancer has come back or hasn't responded to previous treatments) advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  This means it's used in patients whose RCC has progressed despite two or more prior systemic therapies (treatments that affect the whole body).  It's specifically indicated for advanced disease that has spread beyond the kidney.  Currently, there are no other approved uses for Tivozanib.

### Dosage
Tivozanib is administered orally as a capsule. The standard dose for adults with advanced, relapsed, or refractory renal cell carcinoma is 1.34 mg once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day rest period.  This constitutes a 28-day cycle.  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or until unacceptable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dosage may need adjustments based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild liver impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN with AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN with any AST level), no dosage adjustment is necessary.  In cases of moderate impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN with any AST level), the dose should be reduced to 0.89 mg daily.  Dosage adjustments for severe impairment haven't been established.
* **Renal Impairment:** Patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥15 mL/min generally do not require dosage adjustments.  However,  information regarding dosing in end-stage renal disease is not available.  If proteinuria (protein in the urine) reaches or exceeds 2 grams in 24 hours, Tivozanib should be withheld until it falls below this level, then resumed at a reduced dose.  Treatment should be permanently stopped if nephrotic syndrome develops.
* **Toxicity Management:**  Dose reductions or temporary interruptions may be necessary for various side effects, such as hypertension, cardiac failure, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhagic events.  Specific guidelines for dose adjustments based on the severity of these adverse effects are provided in the prescribing information.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Tivozanib in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Hypertension
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Skin rash
* Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome)
* Changes in blood test results (e.g., decreased hemoglobin, decreased platelets, increased liver enzymes)
* Changes in electrolyte levels (e.g., potassium, magnesium, sodium)
* Thyroid dysfunction
* Delirium
* Voice disorders
* Back pain


Less common but potentially serious side effects (1-10% or less) include:

* Cardiac failure
* Arterial or venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)
* Hemorrhagic events (bleeding)
* Proteinuria (protein in the urine)
* Hyperthyroidism
* Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) - a rare but serious neurological condition.

**Important:** Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Tivozanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  This means it works by blocking the activity of specific enzymes called tyrosine kinases. These enzymes are involved in signaling pathways that promote the growth and spread of blood vessels (angiogenesis) that tumors need to survive and grow.  Specifically, Tivozanib targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) -1, -2, and -3,  and other kinases, such as c-kit and PDGFRβ. By inhibiting these receptors, Tivozanib reduces the formation of new blood vessels,  cutting off the tumor's blood supply and hindering its growth.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** Tivozanib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for one month after the last dose. Pregnancy testing is recommended before starting treatment.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether Tivozanib is excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for one month after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided as they may decrease Tivozanib levels, reducing its effectiveness.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **Cardiovascular Risks:** Tivozanib can increase the risk of hypertension, cardiac failure, and thromboembolic events. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart function is essential.
* **Hemorrhage:** Increased risk of bleeding should be considered, particularly in patients with pre-existing bleeding disorders.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for signs of impaired wound healing and RPLS.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Tivozanib with food?** A: Tivozanib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never take two doses at once.
