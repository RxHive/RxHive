# Theobromine
### Generic Name
Theobromine

### Usage
Theobromine, a xanthine derivative, was historically used as a bronchodilator to relax the airways and ease breathing difficulties, particularly in conditions like asthma. It also saw application in treating certain cardiovascular disorders.  However, it's important to note that medicinal theobromine preparations are largely discontinued in most countries due to the availability of more effective and safer alternatives. Theobromine is naturally present in cocoa, chocolate, and in smaller quantities in tea.

### Dosage
Precise dosage information for medicinal theobromine is unavailable as it's no longer commonly prescribed.  Any historical usage would have varied greatly depending on the specific condition, the formulation (if it existed as a tablet, syrup, or injection), and the patient's characteristics.  It is crucial to *never* attempt to self-medicate with theobromine from cocoa or chocolate products. The amount of theobromine in these products varies wildly and is not a reliable source of medication.

### Side Effects
Because medicinal theobromine is not currently widely used, comprehensive data on its side effects is limited. However, based on historical use and its chemical similarity to caffeine and theophylline, potential side effects could include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Diuresis (increased urination)
* Restlessness
*  Increased heart rate (tachycardia)


Serious side effects are less well-documented, but potential concerns might mirror those seen with other xanthines, like seizures at high doses. If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Theobromine acts primarily as an adenosine receptor antagonist. Adenosine is a naturally occurring chemical in the body that, among other actions, constricts airways and can affect blood vessel tone. By blocking adenosine receptors, theobromine counters its effects. This mechanism helps explain its past use as a bronchodilator (opening airways) and in some cardiovascular applications (influencing blood vessel diameter and blood pressure).  However, its effects are much weaker compared to related xanthines like caffeine and theophylline.

### Precautions
As medicinal theobromine is not currently used, specific precautions related to its medicinal use are difficult to comprehensively detail. However, general caution is advised considering its chemical relationship to caffeine and theophylline.  Interactions with other medications are possible.  Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and individuals with underlying health conditions should absolutely avoid self-medicating with theobromine obtained from cocoa or chocolate products.  The potential for overdosing exists given the variability of theobromine content in such foods.  Children and individuals with pre-existing cardiac conditions should exercise extra caution.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use cocoa or chocolate to get the benefits of theobromine?** A:  No. The amount of theobromine in cocoa or chocolate is highly variable and unreliable for medicinal purposes. Self-treating with these products is not safe and can lead to unwanted side effects or overdosing.

* **Q: Is theobromine safe?** A:  In its historical medicinal use, it was considered relatively safe at appropriate doses. However, given its discontinuation and lack of modern clinical trials, a definitive statement cannot be made about its overall safety profile.

* **Q:  Where can I get medicinal theobromine?** A:  Medicinal theobromine preparations are largely unavailable in most countries.  Attempting to obtain it through unofficial channels is unsafe and potentially illegal.

* **Q: What should I do if I suspect a theobromine overdose?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Contact your local poison control center or emergency services.
