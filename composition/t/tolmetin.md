# Tolmetin
### Generic Name
Tolmetin

### Usage
Tolmetin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis in adults.  This includes both managing acute flares of pain and inflammation and providing long-term relief for chronic conditions.  It's also approved for treating juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in children aged 2 years and older.  While its primary use is for arthritis, its analgesic properties may offer some pain relief in other conditions, though this isn't its primary indication.

### Dosage

**Adults (Rheumatoid Arthritis & Osteoarthritis):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is typically 400 mg three times daily (TID).  After one to two weeks, the dosage may be adjusted based on the individual's response. The maintenance dose usually ranges from 600 to 1800 mg/day, divided into three doses. The maximum recommended daily dose is 1800 mg.  Always use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary.

**Children (Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis & Pain):**

* **Oral:**  For children aged 2 years and older, the initial dose is usually calculated based on weight: 20 mg/kg/day divided into 3-4 doses. The maintenance dose is typically 15-30 mg/kg/day, again split into 3-4 doses. The maximum daily dose is 30 mg/kg/day (but not exceeding 1800 mg/day).  Dosage adjustments should be made by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with liver or kidney problems, and Tolmetin may not be recommended for those with advanced renal disease.

* Nausea

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones,  consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Tolmetin is a nonselective NSAID that works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, tolmetin helps to decrease inflammation, relieve pain, and lower fever.  The exact mechanisms responsible for its anti-inflammatory effect are not fully understood but are thought to include effects on immune cells and inflammatory signaling pathways.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tolmetin is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to tolmetin or other NSAIDs, those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, and patients with a history of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (a severe reaction to aspirin or NSAIDs involving asthma, nasal polyps, or angioedema).
* **Drug Interactions:** Tolmetin can interact with many medications, including other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (blood thinners), aspirin, lithium, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and others.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before taking tolmetin.
* **Warnings:**  Tolmetin carries a boxed warning regarding the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (heart attack, stroke) and gastrointestinal problems (bleeding, ulcers, perforation). The risk is higher with prolonged use and in elderly patients.  Use with caution in patients with heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or a history of gastrointestinal problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tolmetin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety in pregnancy hasn't been fully established. It's generally avoided in late pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is necessary during breastfeeding.  A healthcare professional should be consulted.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Tolmetin with alcohol?** A: It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking Tolmetin as alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects.

* **Q: How should I store Tolmetin?** A: Store Tolmetin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as per the directions on the product label.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Tolmetin suddenly?** A:  It is best not to stop taking Tolmetin suddenly. Always talk to your doctor before stopping this medication.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.


* **Q:  Is Tolmetin safe for long-term use?**  A: Long-term use of Tolmetin should be carefully monitored by a physician due to the risks of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications.  The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest time possible.
