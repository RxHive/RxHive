# Tolmetin

**Generic Name:** Tolmetin

**Usage:**

Tolmetin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions.  It reduces pain and inflammation.  It is available in both immediate-release and extended-release formulations.  Specific dosages and durations of treatment will be determined by a physician based on the individual's condition and response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow prescribed dosage instructions carefully.

**Side Effects:**

Like other NSAIDs, tolmetin can cause a range of side effects, some common and others serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea.  More serious gastrointestinal complications, such as ulcers and bleeding, are possible but less common.
* **Headache:** A fairly common side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Can affect coordination and balance.
* **Fluid retention:** Swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs.
* **Skin rash:** Allergic reactions are possible.


Serious, although less frequent, side effects include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. Symptoms include swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; hives; and severe skin rash.
* **Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation:** This is a serious complication that can lead to hospitalization.
* **Heart attack or stroke:**  Increased risk, particularly with long-term use or high doses.
* **Kidney problems:**  Tolmetin can impair kidney function, especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease or those taking other medications that affect the kidneys.
* **Liver problems:**  Although rare, liver damage is a potential side effect.


**How it Works:**

Tolmetin works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, tolmetin helps to alleviate pain and reduce swelling and inflammation in the affected joints.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take tolmetin with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting tolmetin.  Interactions with other drugs, especially other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (blood thinners), and certain diuretics, are possible and can be dangerous.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking tolmetin?** A:  Alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects when taken with tolmetin. It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while on this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.
* **Q: When should I seek medical attention?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction, severe stomach pain, bloody or black stools, or changes in urination or kidney function.
* **Q: Is tolmetin right for me?** A: Only a doctor can determine if tolmetin is appropriate for your specific medical condition and health history.  They will consider your overall health, other medications you are taking, and potential risks and benefits before prescribing this medication.
