# Temazepam
### Generic Name
Temazepam

### Usage
Temazepam is primarily used for the short-term treatment of insomnia, typically lasting 7-10 days.  It's a benzodiazepine, a class of drugs known for their sedative and hypnotic effects.  While its main application is helping individuals fall asleep and stay asleep, it's also sometimes used as a premedication before surgery to induce sedation and reduce anxiety.  It's crucial to remember that Temazepam is intended for short-term use only; long-term use can lead to dependence and other complications.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the patient's age, health condition, and the reason for use.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.

**Adults (Insomnia):** The usual starting dose is 15-30 mg taken orally at bedtime.  Some individuals may find 7.5 mg sufficient. Older adults or those who are debilitated should start with a lower dose of 7.5 mg at bedtime and adjust as needed under medical supervision.  For transient insomnia (occasional sleep problems), a single 7.5 mg dose may be effective.

**Adults (Pre-operative Sedation):**  The dose ranges from 20-40 mg taken orally 30-60 minutes before surgery.  Older adults should receive a lower dose, typically 10-20 mg, one hour before the procedure.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Temazepam have not been established in children.  It should not be given to children.

### How it Works
Temazepam works by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter in the brain that has a calming effect.  It binds to specific receptors in the brain, increasing the flow of chloride ions into nerve cells. This makes the nerve cells less excitable, leading to a sedative and hypnotic effect. This process promotes relaxation and sleep.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Temazepam is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to Temazepam or other benzodiazepines, those with myasthenia gravis (a muscle weakness disorder), sleep apnea, a history of paradoxical reactions to alcohol or sedatives, and pregnant women.  It should also be avoided in patients with acute alcohol intoxication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Temazepam can significantly increase the effects of other CNS depressants (like opioids, alcohol, antipsychotics, antidepressants, etc.). Concomitant use should generally be avoided. Theophylline can reduce Temazepam's effectiveness.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Temazepam is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it's contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential risks of birth defects, low birth weight, and neonatal withdrawal symptoms.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, and caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults and Debilitated Patients:** Older adults and debilitated individuals are more susceptible to the side effects of Temazepam and should start with lower doses.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised when using Temazepam in patients with liver or kidney disease.  Dosage adjustments are not specifically indicated in the manufacturer's labeling but careful monitoring is required.
* **Dependence and Withdrawal:** Long-term use can lead to physical dependence, and abrupt discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always discontinue Temazepam gradually under medical supervision.
* **Risk of Falls:**  Drowsiness is a common side effect, increasing the risk of falls.
* **Patients with Depression:**  Temazepam should be used with caution in patients with depression.
