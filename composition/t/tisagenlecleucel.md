# Tisagenlecleucel
### Generic Name
Tisagenlecleucel

### Usage

Tisagenlecleucel is a type of immunotherapy, specifically a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.  Its primary use is in treating specific types of blood cancers that haven't responded to other treatments or have relapsed.  These include:

* **B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in patients up to 25 years of age:** This is used for ALL that is refractory (doesn't respond to treatment), or is in its second or later relapse.
* **Relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma:** This includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.  Treatment is in adults who have had two or more lines of systemic therapy.
* **Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL):**  This is also in adults who have had two or more lines of systemic therapy.

It's crucial to understand that Tisagenlecleucel is used only after other treatments have failed. It is *not* a first-line treatment for these cancers.

### Dosage

Tisagenlecleucel dosing is complex and individualized, based on the number of CAR-positive viable T cells, the patient's weight, and the specific cancer being treated.  It's administered intravenously (IV).  A healthcare professional will determine the precise dose.  Generally:

**For Relapsed/Refractory ALL (patients under 25):**

* Patients weighing ≤50 kg: 0.2–5 x 10⁶ CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight.
* Patients weighing >50 kg: 0.1–2.5 x 10⁸ CAR-positive viable T cells.

The treatment involves lymphodepleting chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) given before the Tisagenlecleucel infusion.

**For Relapsed/Refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma and Follicular Lymphoma (adults):**

* 0.6–6 x 10⁸ CAR-positive viable T cells.

This also involves a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, or bendamustine in certain cases) prior to the Tisagenlecleucel infusion.  The timing of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Tisagenlecleucel varies slightly between these lymphoma types.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The dosage for children and adolescents with r/r ALL is similar to the adult ALL dosage, but is weight-based.  Tisagenlecleucel's safety and efficacy haven't been established in pediatric patients with r/r DLBCL or FL.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

Tisagenlecleucel can cause serious side effects.  It's vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**  These vary depending on the cancer type but often include:

* **Nervous system:** Headache, encephalopathy, delirium, anxiety, dizziness
* **Cardiovascular:** Hypotension, tachycardia, hypertension
* **Gastrointestinal:** Decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain
* **Hematologic:**  Various blood count abnormalities (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia)
* **Hepatic:** Increased liver enzyme levels
* **Respiratory:** Hypoxia, dyspnea, cough
* **Renal:** Acute kidney injury
* **Infections:** Increased susceptibility to infections
* **Others:** Pyrexia (fever), fatigue, edema, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):** These include, but aren't limited to:

* Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) – a potentially life-threatening reaction.
* Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) – neurological complications.
* Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
* Serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Secondary malignancies


### How it Works

Tisagenlecleucel works by harnessing the power of the patient's own immune system.  T cells (a type of white blood cell) are extracted from the patient's blood, genetically modified to express a CAR that specifically targets the CD19 protein found on the surface of cancerous B cells.  These modified T cells are then infused back into the patient. The CAR-modified T cells then recognize and destroy the CD19-positive cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):**  This is a significant risk.  Early detection and management are crucial.  Tocilizumab is a medication commonly used to treat severe CRS.
* **Neurological Toxicities (ICANS):**  Neurological side effects can range from mild to life-threatening.  Close monitoring is necessary.
* **Infections:** The treatment can weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Allergic reactions can occur.
* **Pre-existing conditions:** Patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders shouldn't receive Tisagenlecleucel.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Tisagenlecleucel is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:**  Tisagenlecleucel can interact with other medications, especially corticosteroids and live vaccines.  Discuss all medications with a healthcare provider.
* **REMS Program:**  Tisagenlecleucel is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, which includes requirements for healthcare providers and pharmacies.

### FAQs

* **How is Tisagenlecleucel administered?** It's administered intravenously (IV) in a hospital or clinic setting.
* **How long does treatment take?** The treatment process is lengthy, involving cell collection, modification, and then infusion. Hospital stays are necessary during and after infusion.
* **How is CRS managed?**  Management of CRS depends on severity, and may involve supportive care, tocilizumab, and corticosteroids.
* **What are the long-term effects?** Long-term follow-up is needed to monitor for potential long-term side effects, such as secondary malignancies and immune deficiencies.
* **How is Tisagenlecleucel stored?** Storage instructions are specific and provided by the manufacturer.
* **Who should not receive Tisagenlecleucel?** Patients with active infections, uncontrolled inflammatory disorders, and those who cannot tolerate the lymphodepleting chemotherapy are typically not candidates.
