# Temoporfin
### Generic Name
Temoporfin

### Usage
Temoporfin is a photosensitizing agent used in photodynamic therapy (PDT).  Its primary use is for the palliative treatment of patients with advanced head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This means it's used to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in patients whose cancer has not responded to other treatments or for whom other treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy) are unsuitable.  It's important to note that Temoporfin itself doesn't directly kill cancer cells; instead, it makes the cancer cells more vulnerable to destruction by light.

### Dosage
Temoporfin is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage for adults with advanced HNSCC is 0.15 mg/kg of body weight, given as a single slow IV injection over at least 6 minutes.  Crucially, this injection must be followed 96 hours later by illumination of the treatment site with light at a wavelength of 652 nm from an approved laser source.  The light treatment must occur between 90 and 110 hours after the Temoporfin injection, delivering a dose of 20 J/cm² at an irradiance of 100 mW/cm². This usually takes approximately 200 seconds. A second course of treatment may be considered after a minimum of 4 weeks, at the discretion of the physician.  There is no established pediatric use for Temoporfin.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specifically defined in the manufacturer's labeling, though caution is advised in patients with liver disease.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Burning sensation
* Constipation
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Vomiting
* Nausea
* Mouth ulceration
* Localized infection at the treatment site (pharyngitis or stomatitis)
* Sepsis (serious bloodstream infection)
* Anemia
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Airway obstruction
* Blistering
* Erythema (redness)
* Skin hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)
* Photosensitivity reaction
* Skin necrosis (tissue death)
* Trismus (lockjaw)
* Pain in the treated area (facial pain, headache, injection site pain)
* Edema (swelling) in the treated area (face or tongue)
* Vascular rupture


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are also possible.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Temoporfin is a photosensitizer.  This means it absorbs light energy and then transfers that energy to oxygen molecules in the body. This process generates highly reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which damage and kill cells.  When administered intravenously, Temoporfin accumulates preferentially in tumor cells. The subsequent light activation, specifically at 652 nm, triggers the generation of these reactive oxygen species, leading to the destruction of the tumor cells. This process is highly targeted to the illuminated area, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Temoporfin should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to Temoporfin or any component of the formulation, porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme production), other light-exacerbated diseases, hypersensitivity to porphyrins, current treatment with other photosensitizing agents, tumors eroding into major blood vessels near the illumination site, planned surgery within 30 days, or ophthalmic disease requiring slit-lamp examination within 30 days.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with other photosensitizing agents (e.g., topical 5-fluorouracil) may increase the risk of skin photosensitivity.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Temoporfin should be avoided during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.  Effective contraception is required during treatment and for three months afterward.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued for at least one month post-injection as excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **General Precautions:** Patients will be temporarily photosensitive; skin and eyes should be protected from bright light for at least 15 days post-injection, and prolonged sunlight exposure to the injection site arm should be avoided for 6 months after treatment.  Extravasation (leakage from the vein during injection) should be carefully managed, and the affected area protected from light.  Proper illumination techniques during photoactivation are essential to minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does photosensitivity last after Temoporfin treatment?**  A:  Significant photosensitivity typically lasts for 15 days after the injection, though precautions are advised for up to 6 months, particularly at the injection site.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: How is Temoporfin stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication packaging.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving Temoporfin?** A:  This depends on any side effects experienced.  Always follow your physician's advice. Temoporfin contains ethanol, so driving could be affected.

* **Q:  Is Temoporfin suitable for all types of head and neck cancer?** A:  No, it is specifically indicated for advanced head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma in patients where other treatments are unsuitable or have failed.
