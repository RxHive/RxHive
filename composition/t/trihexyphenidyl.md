# Trihexyphenidyl
### Generic Name
Trihexyphenidyl

### Usage
Trihexyphenidyl is primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in the management of various forms of Parkinsonism.  This includes postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It helps to control the symptoms associated with these conditions.  A secondary, but important, use is in the management of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) that can be caused by certain medications affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as antipsychotics.  These EPS can manifest as muscle rigidity, tremors, and involuntary movements. Trihexyphenidyl helps alleviate these side effects.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Parkinsonism (as an adjunct):** The initial oral dose is typically 1 mg. This is gradually increased to a maintenance dose of 6-10 mg daily, divided into 3-4 doses.  The increase should be done in 2 mg increments every 3-5 days, as tolerated.  The maximum daily dose is generally 12-15 mg.  If used with levodopa, the dosage of both medications may need to be reduced.  The usual range when used with levodopa is 3-6 mg/day in divided doses.
* **Drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms:** The initial oral dose is 1 mg. This may be repeated in several hours if needed. The maintenance dose usually ranges from 5-15 mg daily, divided into 3-4 doses.  The maximum daily dose remains 15 mg.  Prophylactic use to prevent EPS is generally not recommended; the decision should be based on individual factors and risk assessment.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of trihexyphenidyl in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment; therefore, caution is advised in patients with these conditions.

### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Urinary retention
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nervousness
* Confusion
* Agitation
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hallucinations
* Delusions
* Paranoia
* Increased intraocular pressure (which could worsen glaucoma)
* Allergic skin rash
* Severe constipation (including potential for bowel obstruction)
* High fever (especially in hot conditions)

If any side effects occur, especially those listed as potentially serious, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic medication.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain and body that plays a role in muscle movement and other bodily functions. By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, trihexyphenidyl helps to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced EPS.  In Parkinson's, the imbalance between acetylcholine and dopamine (another neurotransmitter) contributes to the characteristic symptoms; trihexyphenidyl helps to restore a more balanced state.  In the case of drug-induced EPS, it counters the effects of the drug that caused the imbalance.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Trihexyphenidyl is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, and in those with narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Interactions:**  Trihexyphenidyl may interact with several other medications, including phenothiazines, clozapine, antihistamines, disopyramide, nefopam, amantadine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), metoclopramide, domperidone, and levodopa. Concomitant use with these medications should be avoided or carefully managed under a physician's supervision.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal obstructive disease, glaucoma, hepatic or renal impairment, prostatic hyperplasia, urinary stricture or retention, mental illness, and in hot weather or during physical exertion.  The elderly are particularly sensitive to anticholinergic side effects.  The risk of overheating (hyperthermia) is increased, especially in hot environments.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Trihexyphenidyl is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risk to the fetus is not fully established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, and it may suppress lactation; therefore, use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking trihexyphenidyl suddenly?** A: No. Abrupt withdrawal can lead to worsening of symptoms. Always follow your doctor's instructions for stopping the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How should I store trihexyphenidyl?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking this medication?** A: Dizziness and drowsiness are possible side effects, so avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.
* **Q: Is trihexyphenidyl suitable for long-term use?** A: This is determined by your doctor based on your individual condition and response to treatment.  Long-term use requires regular monitoring for side effects.
* **Q:  What if I experience severe constipation?** A: Severe constipation is a serious side effect. Consult your doctor immediately.  This may require treatment beyond dietary changes.
