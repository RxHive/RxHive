# Tiopronin
### Generic Name
Tiopronin

### Usage
Tiopronin is primarily used to prevent cystine kidney stones in adults and children weighing at least 20 kg who have severe homozygous cystinuria and haven't responded adequately to other treatments like increased fluid intake, alkalinization of urine, and dietary changes.  It's crucial to understand that Tiopronin works in conjunction with these other measures; it's not a standalone treatment.  It's specifically indicated for preventing stone formation, not dissolving existing stones.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Initial Dose:** 800 mg per day, divided into three doses.
* **Average Dose:** 1000 mg per day.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  The dose is adjusted based on the results of urine cystine level tests. The goal is to maintain urine cystine levels below 250 mg/L.  Dosage adjustments are made under close medical supervision.

**Children (2 years and older, weighing â‰¥20 kg):**

* **Initial Dose:** 15 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses.
* **Titration:** The dose is carefully increased or decreased until the urine cystine level is below 250 mg/L.
* **Maximum Dose:** 50 mg/kg/day.

**Important Considerations:**

* Tiopronin tablets are not suitable for children under 2 years of age or those weighing less than 20 kg, or children who cannot swallow tablets.
* The medication is always used alongside a regimen of increased fluid intake, urine alkalinization, and dietary modifications.  Lower starting doses may be considered for patients who have experienced severe toxicity to D-penicillamine in the past.
* Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specifically addressed in the manufacturer's labeling.  Close monitoring is required in these cases.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Oral mucosa ulcers
* Diarrhea
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Weakness (asthenia)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Chest pain
* Swelling in the extremities (peripheral edema)
* Hives (urticaria)
* Bruising (ecchymoses)
* Itching (pruritus)
* Vomiting
* Loss of appetite (anorexia)
* Abdominal pain
* Protein in the urine (proteinuria)
* Impotence
* Anemia
* Cough
* Fever

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Tiopronin can potentially cause more serious side effects, some appearing after the medication is on the market. These include, but aren't limited to: Goodpasture syndrome, various hematologic toxicities, hypersensitivity reactions, myasthenia gravis, pemphigus, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous nephropathy.  Renal failure has also been reported.  **Any new or worsening symptoms should be immediately reported to a doctor.**

### How it Works

Tiopronin is a thiol compound that acts as a reducing agent.  It chemically reacts with cystine in the urine, forming a more water-soluble compound (Tiopronin-cysteine disulfide). This makes it easier for the body to eliminate cystine through the urine, thereby reducing the amount of cystine available to form kidney stones.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Tiopronin should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to Tiopronin or any of its components, or those with a history of blood disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The use of Tiopronin with myelosuppressive agents (medications that suppress bone marrow function) or clozapine increases the risk of infections.  It's vital to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Tiopronin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking Tiopronin because its excretion in breast milk is unknown and it can potentially reduce milk production.
* **Specific Populations:** Close monitoring is needed for individuals with liver or kidney problems, as dosage adjustments may not be available.  Children and older adults should also be carefully monitored.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of kidney function, urine protein levels, urine cystine levels, and complete blood count is crucial while using Tiopronin.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Tiopronin?**  A:  It usually takes about a month to see a reduction in urine cystine levels, but the full therapeutic effect may take longer.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Tiopronin if my symptoms improve?** A: No, do not stop taking Tiopronin without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely may lead to recurrence of cystine stone formation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store Tiopronin?** A:  Store Tiopronin according to the instructions provided on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
