# Tranexamic Acid + Diclofenac
### Generic Name
Tranexamic Acid + Diclofenac

**Note:**  Tranexamic acid and diclofenac are often combined in over-the-counter (OTC) medications, particularly for menstrual pain relief. However, the precise formulation (ratio of each ingredient, added excipients) can vary between brands. This information provides general details; always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate dosage and usage instructions.  A prescription may be necessary for higher strengths or specific conditions.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve pain and reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).  Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), targets pain and inflammation. Tranexamic acid works by reducing bleeding by stabilizing blood clots.  While primarily used for menstrual issues, some formulations might be used off-label for other conditions involving bleeding and pain, but this should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation, the individual's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.  **Crucially, this information is not a substitute for the instructions on your specific medication.**  Always adhere to the prescribing information or the instructions on the product packaging.

* **Oral:**  For menstrual pain, tablets or capsules are usually taken orally, typically several times daily for a limited duration, usually only during the menstrual period.
* **IV:**  Intravenous administration is not common for this combination; diclofenac and tranexamic acid are usually given intravenously separately in a hospital setting for specific medical conditions, such as post-surgical bleeding.

**Children's Dosage:** This combination is generally not recommended for children without specific medical guidance.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for children based on their weight and age, which must be determined by a doctor.

**Important:** Never exceed the recommended dosage.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, stomach pain, diarrhea, dizziness, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), increased risk of bleeding (with some pre-existing conditions), kidney problems, liver problems, ulcers, high blood pressure.
* **Rare but Potentially Life-Threatening:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), gastrointestinal bleeding.

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, stop taking the medication and consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in the inflammatory process.  Tranexamic acid works by preventing the breakdown of blood clots, thereby reducing bleeding.  The combination effectively addresses both the pain and bleeding associated with heavy menstrual periods.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with known allergies to diclofenac, tranexamic acid, or any NSAID.  It's also usually contraindicated in individuals with certain bleeding disorders, severe kidney or liver disease, and during pregnancy (especially in the later stages).
* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination may interact with several other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), aspirin, other NSAIDs, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all the medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy is generally discouraged, especially in the third trimester. The effect on breastfeeding is not fully understood; consult with a healthcare professional.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, requiring closer monitoring.
* **Other precautions:** Patients with a history of ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding should exercise caution.
