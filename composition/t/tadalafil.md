# Tadalafil
### Generic Name
Tadalafil

### Usage

Tadalafil is a medication primarily used to treat three distinct conditions:

1.  **Erectile Dysfunction (ED):**  Tadalafil helps men achieve and maintain an erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse. It works by increasing blood flow to the penis in response to sexual stimulation.

2.  **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):** This medication alleviates the symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland, such as difficulty urinating, weak urine stream, and frequent urination, particularly at night.  While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed to relax prostate muscles, improving urine flow.

3.  **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH):**  In this serious lung condition, blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs is abnormally high. Tadalafil improves exercise capacity in patients with PAH by relaxing blood vessels in the lungs, reducing the strain on the heart.  This is a less common use compared to its applications in ED and BPH.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the individual's health status.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Erectile Dysfunction:**

*   **As-needed:**  The usual starting dose is 10 mg, taken at least 30 minutes before anticipated sexual activity.  The dose can be adjusted (5-20 mg) based on effectiveness and tolerance.  No more than one dose per day should be taken.
*   **Daily:**  A lower daily dose (2.5-5 mg) is sometimes prescribed for daily use, regardless of sexual activity.

**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):**

*   The typical dose is 5 mg once daily.  When used in combination with finasteride, treatment typically lasts for no more than 26 weeks.


**Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH):**

*   The usual dose is 40 mg once daily.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of tadalafil in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage may need to be adjusted in individuals with liver or kidney problems.  Concomitant use with certain other medications may also require dosage adjustments.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your individual circumstances.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Headache
*   Flushing (redness of the face, neck, and chest)
*   Nasal congestion
*   Muscle aches
*   Indigestion

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Prolonged erection (priapism) â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
*   Sudden decrease or loss of vision
*   Sudden decrease or loss of hearing
*   Heart attack or stroke
*   Severe allergic reactions

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Tadalafil belongs to a class of drugs called phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors.  It works by increasing levels of a substance called cyclic GMP (cGMP) in the body.  cGMP relaxes blood vessels, leading to increased blood flow.

*   **In ED:** This increased blood flow facilitates erections.
*   **In BPH:** It relaxes muscles in the prostate and bladder, improving urine flow.
*   **In PAH:** It relaxes blood vessels in the lungs, reducing blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Tadalafil is contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe heart disease, low blood pressure, recent stroke or heart attack, certain eye conditions (e.g., non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy), or those currently using nitrates (used to treat angina).  It should not be used with riociguat (a pulmonary hypertension medication).

*   **Interactions:** Tadalafil can interact with certain medications, including nitrates, alpha-blockers, and some antifungal medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

*   **Specific populations:** Use caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, bleeding disorders, or those at risk for priapism.  The safety of tadalafil during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.

*   **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption can worsen the side effects of Tadalafil.

*   **Grapefruit Juice:** Avoid grapefruit juice as it can increase the blood levels of tadalafil.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Tadalafil with alcohol?**  A: While you can take it with alcohol, excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of side effects such as dizziness and headache. It's best to limit alcohol intake.

*   **Q: How should I store Tadalafil?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

*   **Q: How long does Tadalafil last?** A:  The duration of effect varies depending on the dosage and individual factors, but the effects can last for up to 36 hours for the as-needed treatment of erectile dysfunction.  For daily use, the effects are sustained over the course of the day.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose of Tadalafil for BPH or PAH, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose.  For the as-needed treatment of ED, only take it as directed. Do not double the dose.
