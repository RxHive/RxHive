# Trospium
### Generic Name
Trospium

### Usage
Trospium is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is a condition characterized by urinary urgency (a sudden, strong urge to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than normal), and urge incontinence (involuntary loss of urine due to urgency).  Trospium helps manage these symptoms by relaxing the bladder muscles. While not a primary indication, it may offer some benefit in reducing symptoms associated with other urinary conditions, though this should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Overactive Bladder:** The dosage varies depending on the formulation:
    * **Immediate-release tablets:** The usual starting dose is 20 mg twice daily (BID).  For patients aged 75 years and older, the initial dose may be reduced to 20 mg once daily (OD) before gradually increasing as tolerated.
    * **Extended-release capsules:** The usual dose is 60 mg once daily (OD) in the morning.

**Children:**

The safety and effectiveness of trospium in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, caution is advised, and close monitoring for adverse effects is crucial.  Severe hepatic impairment may require alternative treatment options.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥30 mL/min, dosage adjustments are not explicitly stated in the manufacturer’s labeling. However, renal impairment can increase systemic exposure to trospium. Close monitoring for side effects is necessary. If CrCl is <30 mL/min, the immediate-release formulation may be used at a reduced dose of 20 mg once daily at bedtime. The extended-release formulation is generally not recommended.


**Administration:** Immediate-release tablets should be taken with water on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before meals. Extended-release capsules should be taken in the morning with water on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before a meal.

### How it Works

Trospium is an anticholinergic medication.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates bladder muscle contractions. By inhibiting acetylcholine's effects on muscarinic receptors in the bladder, trospium reduces the muscle spasms and involuntary contractions that cause the symptoms of overactive bladder.  This leads to decreased urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Trospium is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to trospium or its components.
* Gastric retention (delayed emptying of the stomach).
* Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma (a type of eye disease).
* Patients with or at risk of urinary retention (inability to completely empty the bladder).


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Increased risk of:** Angioedema (especially involving the face, lips, tongue, and larynx), and central nervous system (CNS) effects (drowsiness, confusion, dizziness, hallucinations, blurred vision).
* **Use with caution:** In patients with Alzheimer's disease, bladder outlet obstruction, gastrointestinal obstructive disorders (e.g., pyloric stenosis), controlled narrow-angle glaucoma, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, myasthenia gravis, renal impairment (especially with immediate-release formulation), ulcerative colitis, and in elderly patients.  Caution is also advised when used with other medications eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g., procainamide, pancuronium, vancomycin, morphine, metformin, and tenofovir).
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Trospium is classified as pregnancy category C.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Whether trospium is excreted in breast milk is unknown.  The decision to breastfeed while taking trospium should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking trospium?** A:  No, you should avoid driving or operating machinery, especially when starting treatment or increasing the dose, as trospium can cause drowsiness, dizziness, or blurred vision.

* **Q: How should I store trospium?** A: Store trospium at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, but only if it is at least 1 hour before your next meal. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking trospium?** A: Combining alcohol with trospium, particularly the extended-release formulation, may increase drowsiness.  Avoid alcohol consumption within 2 hours of taking a dose of extended-release Trospium.

* **Q:  Can I take other medications with trospium?** A: Inform your doctor of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.  Several interactions are possible.

* **Q:  How long will it take before I see results from trospium?** A: It may take several weeks of treatment to see the full benefits.  Be patient and continue taking the medication as directed.  If you do not see improvement in your symptoms after a reasonable period, talk to your doctor.
