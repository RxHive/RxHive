# Trospium

**Generic Name:** Trospium chloride

**Usage:**

Trospium chloride is an anticholinergic medication primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is characterized by symptoms such as urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.  It can also be used to treat other conditions associated with bladder spasms, though this is less common.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of trospium chloride include:

* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Difficulty urinating (especially in men with prostate problems)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Drowsiness

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye)
* Urinary retention (inability to urinate)
* Heat stroke (especially in hot, humid weather)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


**How it Works:**

Trospium chloride works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates bladder muscle contractions. By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, trospium chloride helps to relax the bladder muscles, reducing the frequency and urgency of urination.  This helps to control the symptoms of overactive bladder.
