# Teneligliptin
### Generic Name
Teneligliptin

### Usage

Teneligliptin is a medication used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's categorized as a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  Its primary use is as an adjunct to diet and exercise, meaning it works best in conjunction with lifestyle changes to control blood sugar levels. It can be used as monotherapy (the sole medication) or in combination with other diabetes medications.  Importantly, teneligliptin is *not* used for type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes) or for managing diabetic ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes).

### Dosage

**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):** The usual dose is 20 mg once daily (OD) by mouth.  This dosage is consistent regardless of renal impairment. For those with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed; however, use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for severe hepatic impairment.  It's crucial to note that using teneligliptin concurrently with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) is generally avoided due to a lack of demonstrable additional benefit in lowering blood glucose.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of teneligliptin in children have not been established, and it is therefore not recommended for pediatric use.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports and/or case studies):**

* Abdominal pain
* Abdominal swelling
* Acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Albuminuria (protein in the urine)
* Allergic dermatitis (skin inflammation)
* Allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Apathy (lack of feeling or emotion)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Duodenal ulcer
* Eczema
* Epigastric distress (upper abdominal discomfort)
* Gastric polyps (abnormal growths in the stomach)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels (indicative of muscle damage)
* Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (indicative of liver damage)
* Increased serum ALP, ALT, AST, amylase, and lipase levels (indicative of liver or pancreatic damage)
* Increased serum potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Increased uric acid levels (hyperuricemia)
* Interstitial pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Intestinal obstruction
* Intestinal polyps (colon)
* Ketonuria (ketones in the urine)
* Nausea
* Occult blood in urine (blood in urine not visible to the naked eye)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Reflux esophagitis (heartburn)
* Skin rash
* Stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Teneligliptin works by inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme.  DPP-4 is responsible for breaking down incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).  By blocking DPP-4, teneligliptin increases the levels of these incretins.  Incretins stimulate insulin release from the pancreas in response to glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream, and they also suppress the release of glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar).  This combined effect leads to improved glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Teneligliptin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components, diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic coma or precoma, type 1 diabetes, severe infections, preoperative or postoperative states, and severe trauma.

**Interactions:**  Teneligliptin can interact with various other medications.  Its effects can be decreased by some medications (e.g., certain diabetes medications, quinolones, ritodrine, thiazide diuretics), and it can, in turn, affect the levels of other medications (e.g., ACE inhibitors, haloperidol, insulin, QT-prolonging agents, sulfonylureas).  It is important to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Warnings:** Teneligliptin should be used cautiously in patients with a history of or at risk for abdominal surgery, ileus (intestinal blockage), heart failure, or severe hepatic dysfunction. There's an increased risk of arthralgia (joint pain), bullous pemphigoid (a skin blistering disorder), hepatotoxicity (liver damage), hypoglycemia, acute pancreatitis, and QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm).  Avoid tasks requiring alertness if experiencing side effects.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of teneligliptin during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  It's generally recommended to avoid its use during pregnancy, and breastfeeding should be avoided while taking teneligliptin.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take teneligliptin with other diabetes medications?** A: Yes, it is often used in combination with other diabetes medications, but it's crucial to consult your doctor to determine the appropriate combination and dosage.


* **Q: How should I store teneligliptin?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. Generally, it should be stored at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.


* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking teneligliptin?** A: While there's no specific contraindication against alcohol, excessive alcohol consumption can interfere with blood sugar control.  It's always best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.


* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with teneligliptin?** A: Long-term studies are ongoing, but currently, the most significant concern revolves around potential long-term risks associated with some side effects mentioned above (pancreatitis, liver issues, etc.). Regular monitoring by your doctor is essential.
