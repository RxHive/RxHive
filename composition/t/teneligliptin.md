# Teneligliptin

**Generic Name:** Teneligliptin

**Usage:** Teneligliptin is used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's usually used in combination with other diabetes medications, such as metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin,  rather than as a monotherapy (used alone).  It's not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, teneligliptin can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Upper respiratory tract infection:**  Such as cold symptoms.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect in many medications.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):**  Especially if used in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas. Symptoms can include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, and confusion.  This is more serious and requires immediate attention.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty having a bowel movement.
* **Nasopharyngitis:** Inflammation of the nose and throat.
* **Back pain:**  Aching or pain in the back.

Rare but more serious side effects can also occur.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to your doctor.

**How it Works:** Teneligliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  It works by increasing the levels of incretins, hormones that help your body release insulin when blood sugar levels are high and reduce the amount of glucose your liver produces. This ultimately helps lower blood sugar levels.
