# Testosterone (Intranasal)
### Generic Name
Testosterone (Intranasal)

### Usage
Testosterone (intranasal) is a hormone replacement therapy used in adult males to treat conditions linked to a deficiency or absence of naturally produced testosterone.  These conditions include primary hypogonadism (both congenital and acquired) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (also congenital and acquired).  This medication works by supplementing the body's natural testosterone levels, helping to restore normal hormonal function.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical dosage for primary or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is 11 mg of testosterone three times daily (TID). This is administered intranasally using a pump delivering two actuations (one per nostril) per dose, for a total daily dose of 33 mg.  Serum testosterone levels should be monitored regularly, starting one month after treatment begins.  Treatment should be stopped if the total testosterone level consistently exceeds 1050 ng/dL, and an alternative treatment should be considered if levels consistently remain below 300 ng/dL.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of intranasal testosterone in children under 18 years of age have not been established.  This medication is not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, close monitoring by a healthcare professional is always advisable.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Rhinorrhea (runny nose)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Nasal discomfort
* Increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels
* Nasal scab formation
* Parosmia (altered sense of smell)
* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Nasal dryness
* Nasal congestion
* Bronchitis
* Sinusitis
* Increased blood pressure
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Testosterone is a crucial male sex hormone responsible for the development and maintenance of male reproductive tissues, secondary sexual characteristics (such as increased muscle mass, bone density, and body hair), and overall sexual function. In individuals with testosterone deficiency, this medication replaces the missing hormone, allowing the body to resume normal development and function.  Intranasal administration allows for direct absorption into the bloodstream, bypassing the first-pass metabolism that occurs with oral administration.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Testosterone (intranasal) is contraindicated in men with breast cancer or suspected/confirmed prostate cancer.  It is also contraindicated in women who are pregnant, may become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.


**Warnings:**  Increased risk of nasal side effects (like those listed above) and worsening of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms are possible.  There's also an increased risk of prostate cancer, polycythemia (increased red blood cells), venous thromboembolic events, suppression of spermatogenesis, gynecomastia (breast development in males), dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid levels), hypercalcemia (high calcium levels, especially in cancer patients), sleep apnea (in obese patients or those with lung disease), peliosis hepatis (blood-filled cysts in the liver), hepatic neoplasms (liver tumors), decreased thyroid-binding globulins, edema (swelling), myocardial infarction (heart attack), and stroke.

**Use with Caution:** Use cautiously in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia.  Testosterone therapy may influence blood glucose levels in diabetic patients and anticoagulant activity in patients on warfarin, requiring close monitoring.  Concurrent use with corticosteroids can increase fluid retention.


**Other Precautions:**  Avoid use in individuals with a history of nasal disorders, nasal surgery, nasal fracture, mucosal inflammatory disorders, rhinitis, or sinus disease. Avoid using other nasal medications concurrently, except for sympathomimetic decongestants. Temporarily discontinue use if severe rhinitis develops; consider alternative therapy if rhinitis persists.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from testosterone (intranasal) treatment?**  A:  The onset of effects can vary, but improvements in symptoms associated with testosterone deficiency may be noticeable within a few weeks.  Regular monitoring is necessary to assess effectiveness.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from light and moisture, as directed on the label.

* **Q: Can I use other nasal sprays while using Testosterone (intranasal)?** A: Generally, no.  Only sympathomimetic decongestants are allowed.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before using any other nasal medication.
