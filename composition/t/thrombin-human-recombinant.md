# Thrombin Human, Recombinant
### Generic Name
Thrombin Human, Recombinant

### Usage
Thrombin human, recombinant is a hemostatic agent. Its primary use is to help control bleeding from capillaries and small venules where standard surgical methods are ineffective or impractical.  This means it's used topically to help stop minor bleeding, typically oozing blood, in situations where other methods aren't sufficient.  It's not intended for use in cases of major arterial bleeding or brisk bleeding.

### Dosage
**Control of Hemorrhage (Topical Application):**

* **Adults and Children ≥ 1 month:**  The dosage is determined by the area of bleeding and the method of application.  It's available as a topical powder for solution (5000 IU or 20000 IU). The powder is typically applied directly to the bleeding tissue, with or without an absorbable gelatin sponge. The exact amount needed will vary based on the size of the bleeding area.  

**Important Note:** The safety and effectiveness of thrombin human, recombinant haven't been established for children under 1 month of age.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are rarely reported (less than 10% incidence):

* Thromboembolism (blood clot formation in a blood vessel)

Less common side effects (≤2% incidence):

* Antibody formation (development of antibodies against the drug)


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Serious, though rare, reactions such as hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) are possible.

### How it Works
Thrombin human, recombinant is a coagulation protein. It works by directly converting fibrinogen (a blood protein) into fibrin, a key component of blood clots. This process rapidly forms a clot, effectively stemming the flow of blood from small vessels.  Unlike some other clotting factors, it doesn't require additional physiological agents to work.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to thrombin human, recombinant, any of its components, or hamster proteins.
* Arterial bleeding (significant or rapid).
* Direct circulatory injection (never inject this medication systemically).


**Warnings:**

* Thrombin human, recombinant is for topical use only; never inject it. Systemic injection can cause widespread blood clotting and potentially death.
* There's an increased risk of thrombosis (blood clot formation) and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.
* Use single-dose vials only. Reconstitute with the provided diluent at room temperature, avoiding excessive shaking.
* If using an absorbable gelatin sponge, apply it in a single layer to the bleeding area.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  This medication falls under pregnancy category C.  It should only be used in pregnant women if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk; the decision to breastfeed while using this medication should be made carefully, considering the potential risks to the infant and the benefits of breastfeeding and treatment to the mother.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  Effective hemostasis (stopping bleeding) is usually observed within 10 minutes.

* **Q: Can I use this on deep wounds?** A: No, it's designed for superficial bleeding from capillaries and small venules.  Deep wounds require more extensive treatment.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A:  Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I have a reaction?** A:  Stop use immediately and seek medical attention.

* **Q: Is this medication suitable for all ages?** A: No, safety and efficacy have not been established for infants under 1 month old.
