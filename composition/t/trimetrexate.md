# Trimetrexate
### Generic Name
Trimetrexate

### Usage
Trimetrexate is primarily used to treat moderate-to-severe *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS.  It serves as an alternative treatment option when patients are unresponsive to, intolerant of, or have contraindications to the standard treatment, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.  Currently, it's not approved for other indications.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage for *Pneumocystis jirovecii* Pneumonia:**

The typical dose is 45 mg/m² per day administered intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes. Treatment typically lasts 21 days for trimetrexate, and leucovorin (folinic acid) must be given concurrently for 24 days (including 72 hours after the final trimetrexate dose) to mitigate severe toxicities.  Leucovorin can be administered intravenously at 20 mg/m² every 6 hours (total daily dose of 80 mg/m²) or orally in four divided doses of 20 mg/m² throughout the day (round up to the nearest 25 mg increment for oral doses).

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Safety and efficacy of trimetrexate in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Trimetrexate should be discontinued if liver enzyme levels (transaminases or alkaline phosphatase) increase to more than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN).
* **Renal Impairment:** Treatment should be stopped if serum creatinine levels rise above 2.5 mg/dL, and the increase is attributed to trimetrexate.

### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Anemia
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes)
* Diarrhea
* Rashes
* Pruritus (itching)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Hypocalcemia (low calcium levels)
* Confusion

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can also occur.  It's crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works
Trimetrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor.  DHFR is an enzyme crucial for the production of tetrahydrofolate, a vital coenzyme involved in DNA synthesis.  By inhibiting DHFR, trimetrexate prevents the formation of tetrahydrofolate, thus disrupting DNA synthesis and ultimately inhibiting the growth and replication of *Pneumocystis jirovecii*.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Trimetrexate is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to trimetrexate, leucovorin, or methotrexate.
* **Leucovorin:**  **Concurrent administration of leucovorin is absolutely essential** to prevent serious and potentially life-threatening toxicities. Leucovorin must be continued for 72 hours after the last dose of trimetrexate.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney problems, and close monitoring of organ function is necessary.
* **Gastric Ulcers:** Use with caution in patients with existing gastric ulcers.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Trimetrexate is categorized as pregnancy category D (positive evidence of risk to the fetus). It's teratogenic and fetotoxic. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.

### FAQs
* **Q: How is trimetrexate administered?**  A: Trimetrexate is administered intravenously over 60 minutes.
* **Q: Why is leucovorin given with trimetrexate?** A: Leucovorin is essential to protect against severe toxicities caused by trimetrexate.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any adverse effects.
* **Q: How is trimetrexate stored?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.  Generally, medications should be stored as directed on the label.
