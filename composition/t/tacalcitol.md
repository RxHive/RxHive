# Tacalcitol
### Generic Name
Tacalcitol

### Usage
Tacalcitol is a topical medication primarily used to treat various skin conditions characterized by excessive skin cell growth and inflammation.  Its main application is in the management of psoriasis vulgaris, a chronic autoimmune disease causing raised, red, scaly patches on the skin.  It's also used for other dermatological conditions such as:

*   **Ichthyosis:** A group of genetic disorders causing dry, scaly skin.
*   **Palmoplantar pustulosis:** A chronic skin condition causing pus-filled blisters on the palms and soles of the feet.
*   **Keratosis:** A general term for skin lesions characterized by thickened skin patches.
*   **Pityriasis rubra pilaris:** A rare inflammatory skin disease causing widespread redness and scaling.

The specific effectiveness of tacalcitol can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the condition.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (cream, lotion, ointment), the condition being treated, and the physician's recommendation.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Here is general information based on common formulations:

* **Psoriasis Vulgaris:**
    * **Ointment/Lotion (0.002%, 0.0004%):**  Applied once daily to affected areas. The maximum daily dose is typically 10 grams of ointment or 10 mL of lotion, but this can vary by product. If using both ointment and lotion simultaneously, the total daily dose shouldn't exceed 200 mcg or 280 mcg weekly.
    * **Cream (0.0002%):** Applied twice daily to affected areas.
    * **Ointment/Lotion (0.0004%):** Treatment may continue for up to 18 months (ointment) or 8 weeks (lotion), with potential for intermittent use.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Tacalcitol is generally not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are usually recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of users) may include:

*   Prickling sensation
*   Skin redness (erythema)
*   Itching (pruritus)
*   Skin irritation

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in less than 1% of users) can include:

*   Burning sensation
*   Contact dermatitis
*   Worsening of psoriasis
*   Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation)
*   Skin swelling
*   Decreased serum phosphate levels
*   High calcium levels (hypercalcemia)
*   Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP)
*   Increased creatinine levels
*   Proteinuria (protein in urine)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.


### How it Works
Tacalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D3 analog.  It works by binding to vitamin D receptors on skin cells (keratinocytes). This binding action slows down the rapid growth of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis and other related conditions.  Simultaneously, it helps to promote the normal maturation and differentiation of skin cells, reducing inflammation and scaling.


### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Tacalcitol should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to tacalcitol or any of its ingredients, or those with hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in the blood) or other calcium metabolism disorders.
*   **Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with medications like aluminum hydroxide, burosumab, certain multivitamins, sucralfate, and other vitamin D analogs. Consult your doctor about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.  Tacalcitol may also affect the levels or effects of erdafitinib.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of tacalcitol during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless specifically directed by a doctor. If breastfeeding, avoid applying to the breast area.
*   **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with kidney problems.
*   **Generalized Pustular or Erythrodermic Psoriasis:** Use with caution in patients with severe forms of psoriasis.

### FAQs
*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated, but improvement is typically seen over several weeks.
