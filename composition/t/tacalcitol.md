# Tacalcitol

**Generic Name:** Tacalcitol

**Usage:**

Tacalcitol is a topical treatment for psoriasis.  It's primarily used to reduce the inflammation and scaling associated with plaque psoriasis, a common skin condition.  It's applied directly to the affected skin areas.  The specific formulation (ointment, cream, etc.) and dosage will be determined by a doctor based on the severity of the psoriasis and the patient's individual needs.  It is generally not used for other skin conditions.

**Side Effects:**

While generally well-tolerated, tacalcitol can cause some side effects, although they are often mild and temporary. These may include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, or redness at the application site.  This is the most common side effect.
* **Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium):**  This is rare, especially with topical application, but it's a serious potential side effect.  It's more likely with extensive use or if the medication is absorbed systemically (into the bloodstream). Symptoms can include fatigue, constipation, and kidney stones.
* **Local skin reactions:**  These could include contact dermatitis, folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), or worsening of existing skin problems.
* **Other rare side effects:** Headache, dizziness, nausea.


**How it Works:**

Tacalcitol is a vitamin D analog.  It works by modulating the immune response and reducing the overproduction of skin cells that characterize psoriasis. It binds to vitamin D receptors in skin cells, leading to decreased inflammation and a reduction in the rate of skin cell growth. This helps to flatten psoriatic plaques, reduce scaling, and improve skin appearance.


**FAQs:**

* **Is tacalcitol safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor.  The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the potential risks.
* **Can I use tacalcitol with other medications?**  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Some interactions are possible.
* **How long does it take to see results?**  Improvement is typically seen within a few weeks of starting treatment, but the full effect may take longer.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor if you experience any significant or persistent side effects.
* **Can I use tacalcitol on my face or genitals?**  Generally, it's not recommended for use on these sensitive areas unless specifically directed by a dermatologist.
* **Can I use sunscreen while using tacalcitol?**  While not a direct interaction, it's advisable to use sunscreen on treated areas to protect against sun sensitivity, particularly if you are using a higher strength formulation.
* **Can I stop using tacalcitol suddenly?**  It's best to follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping treatment to avoid potential flare-ups.
