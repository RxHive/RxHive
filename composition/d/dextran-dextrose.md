# Dextran + Dextrose

It's important to understand that "Dextran + Dextrose" isn't a single, defined drug with a consistent formulation.  Dextran and dextrose are often used *together* in intravenous solutions, but the specific ratios and other additives vary significantly depending on the manufacturer and intended use.  Therefore, providing precise details about "Dextran + Dextrose" as a single entity is impossible.  Instead, I'll describe the individual components and their common combined uses.

**Dextran:**

* **Generic Name:**  Dextran (various molecular weights)
* **Usage:**  Expands plasma volume, improves blood flow, reduces blood viscosity. Used in treatment of hypovolemic shock, burns, and other conditions requiring plasma volume expansion.
* **Side Effects:**  Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe anaphylaxis), fluid overload, bleeding (due to interference with platelet function), kidney problems (especially with high molecular weight dextrans).
* **How it Works:**  Dextran is a large polysaccharide that draws fluid from tissues into the bloodstream, increasing blood volume.  Different molecular weights have different properties and uses.
* **FAQs:**  Are there specific molecular weight dextrans? Yes, ranging from low to high. What are the contraindications?  Severe heart failure, severe renal impairment, bleeding disorders.

**Dextrose (D-glucose):**

* **Generic Name:** Dextrose (D-glucose) or Glucose
* **Usage:**  Provides calories and energy.  Often added to intravenous solutions to provide carbohydrates as a source of energy and prevent hypoglycemia.
* **Side Effects:**  Usually well-tolerated.  In high doses or rapid infusion, it can cause hyperglycemia, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances.
* **How it Works:**  Dextrose is a simple sugar that's readily metabolized by the body to provide energy.
* **FAQs:**  Is dextrose the same as glucose? Yes.  Can it cause blood sugar problems?  Yes, especially in diabetics or those with impaired glucose metabolism.


**Dextran + Dextrose Combinations:**

When used together in intravenous solutions, dextran provides volume expansion while dextrose provides calories. The specific effects and side effects depend entirely on the concentrations of each component and the overall composition of the solution.  A doctor or pharmacist will be able to provide details on a specific product containing both.  **Never attempt to interpret or use such a solution without professional medical guidance.**  Information on a specific product label should be carefully reviewed.
