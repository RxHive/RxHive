# Delafloxacin
### Generic Name
Delafloxacin

### Usage
Delafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat two specific bacterial infections in adults:

* **Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI):**  This includes infections of the skin and tissues just beneath the skin, such as cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections.  Delafloxacin can be used to treat both mild and more severe forms of ABSSSI.

* **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):** This refers to pneumonia acquired outside of a hospital setting. Delafloxacin is effective against bacteria commonly causing CAP.

It's crucial to understand that Delafloxacin is only effective against bacterial infections. It won't treat viral or fungal infections.  A doctor's diagnosis is essential to confirm the type of infection before starting treatment with this medication.


### Dosage

Dosage for Delafloxacin varies depending on the type of infection and the route of administration (intravenous or oral).  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** 300 mg every 12 hours, infused over 60 minutes, for 5-14 days.  This can be followed by oral Delafloxacin for the remainder of the treatment course.
* **Oral:** 450 mg every 12 hours for 5-14 days. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as possible, but no later than 8 hours before the next scheduled dose.  If less than 8 hours remain, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular schedule.

**Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** 300 mg every 12 hours. Treatment should last at least 5 days and continue until the patient is clinically stable (normal vital signs).
* **Oral:** 450 mg every 12 hours. Treatment should last at least 5 days and continue until the patient is clinically stable (normal vital signs).

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Delafloxacin in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for individuals with reduced kidney function (eGFR). Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance.  Delafloxacin is generally not recommended for individuals with severely impaired kidney function (eGFR < 15 mL/min) or those on dialysis.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash
* Abnormal dreams
* Insomnia
* Anxiety
* Increased liver enzymes

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Tendonitis or tendon rupture (inflammation or tearing of tendons)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Central nervous system effects (seizures, hallucinations, confusion)
*  <em>Clostridium difficile</em>-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)
*  Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Delafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial enzymes called topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase.  These enzymes are crucial for bacterial DNA replication and repair. By blocking these enzymes, Delafloxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.  Its effectiveness varies depending on the specific bacteria causing the infection.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Delafloxacin should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to delafloxacin or other fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Delafloxacin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **CNS Disorders:** Use caution in patients with a history of or risk factors for central nervous system disorders (such as seizures or epilepsy).
* **Myasthenia Gravis:**  Delafloxacin can worsen muscle weakness in individuals with myasthenia gravis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Delafloxacin can interact with other medications, including those containing multivalent cations (like calcium or magnesium).  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Tendinitis/Tendon Rupture:** This is a serious potential side effect.  Stop taking Delafloxacin and consult your doctor immediately if you experience pain or swelling in a tendon.
* **Peripheral Neuropathy:** This is a serious side effect that can lead to numbness, tingling, or pain. Consult your doctor immediately if symptoms occur.
