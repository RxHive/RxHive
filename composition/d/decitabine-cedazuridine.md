# Decitabine + Cedazuridine
### Generic Name
Decitabine + Cedazuridine

### Usage

Decitabine and Cedazuridine is a combination therapy used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in adults.  MDS is a group of cancers affecting the bone marrow's ability to produce healthy blood cells. This combination medication is used for both previously treated and untreated MDS, encompassing various subtypes such as refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).  The specific subtypes and risk levels are often categorized using systems like the French-American-British (FAB) classification and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).  This medication aims to improve blood cell counts and overall survival in patients with MDS.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical oral dose is Decitabine 35 mg/Cedazuridine 100 mg once daily (OD) on days 1-5 of a 28-day treatment cycle.  This cycle is repeated for a minimum of four cycles, but continuation depends on disease progression and the presence of unacceptable toxicity.  Achieving a complete or partial response may necessitate more than four cycles.  It's crucial to note that Decitabine and Cedazuridine oral tablets should not replace intravenous Decitabine within a treatment cycle.  Antiemetics (medication to prevent nausea and vomiting) are often administered before each dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine + Cedazuridine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on several factors.  For hepatic (liver) impairment, mild impairment generally doesn't require dose changes, but moderate to severe impairment lacks specific dosage recommendations in the manufacturer's labeling.  For renal (kidney) impairment, adjustments are also not explicitly defined for various creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels below 60 mL/min in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, close monitoring is crucial in cases of decreased renal function.  Dose modifications or treatment delays are typically implemented in cases of significant hematologic (blood cell) toxicity (like low white blood cell or platelet counts) or non-hematologic toxicity (e.g., liver or kidney dysfunction). These adjustments may involve reducing the number of days of medication administration within a cycle or temporarily stopping treatment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

*   Nervous system: Dizziness, fatigue, headache
*   Dermatologic: Skin rash
*   Endocrine and metabolic: Changes in serum albumin, calcium, and glucose levels
*   Gastrointestinal: Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis (mouth sores)
*   Hematologic: Anemia, febrile neutropenia (fever with low white blood cells), hemorrhage (bleeding), leukopenia (low white blood cells), neutropenia (low neutrophils, a type of white blood cell), thrombocytopenia (low platelets)
*   Hepatic: Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALP and transaminases)
*   Infection: Sepsis (a severe bloodstream infection)
*   Respiratory: Dyspnea (shortness of breath), pneumonia

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less):**  These include cardiac arrhythmias, neuropathy, various other metabolic disturbances, and more severe infections.

**Post-Marketing Side Effects:**  These are side effects identified after the drug has been released to the market and include differentiation syndrome and interstitial pulmonary disease.

If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to seek medical advice.

### How it Works

Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent.  After being processed by the body, it's incorporated into DNA, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase enzymes. This action leads to hypomethylation (reduced DNA methylation), altering gene expression and ultimately causing cancer cell death.  Cedazuridine works by inhibiting cytidine deaminase, an enzyme that breaks down Decitabine.  By blocking this enzyme, Cedazuridine increases the amount of Decitabine available to act on the cancer cells. This combination enhances the effectiveness of Decitabine in treating MDS.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Decitabine + Cedazuridine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Decitabine, Cedazuridine, or any components of the formulation.

**Interactions:**  This medication can interact with various other drugs, particularly those affecting bone marrow, the liver, or the immune system. Consult a healthcare professional about any other medications you are taking. Noteworthy interactions include those with 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives, BCG, cladribine, clozapine, deferiprone, and others.

**Warnings:** This medication can cause significant bone marrow suppression, increasing the risk of infection and bleeding.  It also poses a risk of embryo-fetal toxicity.  Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during and for at least two weeks after treatment.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I store Decitabine + Cedazuridine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Follow the specific storage instructions on the label.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, provided it's within 12 hours of the usual time. Contact your doctor for guidance if you're uncertain.

*   **Q:  How long will I need to take this medication?** A: Treatment duration varies depending on individual response, disease progression, and any side effects. Your doctor will determine the appropriate length of treatment.
*   **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects, particularly severe ones, to your doctor immediately. They may adjust your dosage or recommend other strategies to manage the side effects.
