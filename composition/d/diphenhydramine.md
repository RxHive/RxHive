# Diphenhydramine
### Generic Name
Diphenhydramine

### Usage

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies, such as itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.  It's also effective in treating the common cold's upper airway symptoms. Beyond allergies and the common cold, diphenhydramine has several other applications:

* **Insomnia:** Although not the first-line treatment, it can be used for occasional short-term sleep aid.
* **Motion sickness:**  It can help prevent or reduce symptoms of motion sickness.
* **Acute dystonic reactions:** It's used to treat muscle spasms and stiffness caused by certain medications (like antipsychotics).
* **Anaphylaxis (as an adjunct):** While not a primary treatment, it can be used alongside epinephrine in severe allergic reactions.
* **Other uses:**  Diphenhydramine finds off-label use in treating various conditions like urticaria (hives), certain types of poisoning, and infusion reactions.  However, its use in these cases should be under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Diphenhydramine dosages vary significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous).  Always follow a doctor's or pharmacist's specific instructions.  The following information is for general knowledge and should not be interpreted as a prescription:

**Adults:**

* **Oral:**  25-50 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not to exceed 300 mg daily.
* **Intramuscular (IM) or Intravenous (IV):**  Dosages range from 10-50 mg, depending on the condition and severity.  IV administration requires careful monitoring and should be given slowly to prevent adverse effects.  Maximum daily dose is typically 400 mg.

**Children:**

Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight (mg/kg) and the specific condition.  Always consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing information.  Never give diphenhydramine to a child under 6 years of age without direct medical supervision.

**Specific Administration Guidelines:**

* **Oral:** Can be taken with food if stomach upset occurs.
* **IM/IV:** Must be administered by a healthcare professional.
* **Topical:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area as directed on the product label.


### Side Effects

Diphenhydramine, like many medications, can cause side effects.  Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Upset stomach

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:

If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions. By blocking histamine receptors, diphenhydramine reduces symptoms like itching, swelling, and inflammation. Additionally, it possesses anticholinergic properties, which contribute to its effectiveness in treating certain muscle spasms and its side effects like dry mouth and constipation.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Diphenhydramine should be used cautiously during pregnancy and is generally contraindicated during breastfeeding due to its potential transfer into breast milk.
* **Interactions with other medications:** Diphenhydramine can interact with various medications, including other sedatives, alcohol, and certain antidepressants.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Certain medical conditions:** Use caution in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions that could be exacerbated by anticholinergic effects.
* **Older adults and children:** Older adults and children may be more sensitive to diphenhydramine's side effects.
* **Driving and operating machinery:** Diphenhydramine can cause drowsiness and impair alertness. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.


### FAQs

* **Can I take diphenhydramine with alcohol?** No.  Combining diphenhydramine with alcohol can significantly increase drowsiness and other side effects.
* **How should I store diphenhydramine?** Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Is diphenhydramine habit-forming?** Diphenhydramine is not typically considered habit-forming, but long-term use without medical supervision is not recommended.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I take diphenhydramine long-term?**  Long-term use should only be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
