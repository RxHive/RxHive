# Diphenhydramine

**Generic Name:** Diphenhydramine

**Usage:**

Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itching
* Hives
* Rash

It's also used to:

* Treat the common cold
* Reduce symptoms of motion sickness
* Help induce sleep (as a sedative/hypnotic â€“ often in higher doses than for allergy relief)


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness (very common, especially at higher doses)
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Urinary retention

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fast heartbeat
* Irregular heartbeat
* Seizures
* Hallucinations
* Confusion (especially in older adults)
* Liver problems


**How it Works:**

Diphenhydramine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.  It also has anticholinergic effects, meaning it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in various bodily functions, contributing to its sedative and anti-motion sickness effects.  The sedation is a result of its effects on the central nervous system.


**FAQs:**

* **Is diphenhydramine habit-forming?**  Diphenhydramine is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids, but tolerance can develop, meaning you may need a higher dose to achieve the same effect over time.  Psychological dependence, however, can occur, particularly with long-term or high-dose use.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking diphenhydramine?**  Alcohol can significantly increase the sedative effects of diphenhydramine, potentially leading to drowsiness, impaired coordination, and other dangerous side effects. Avoid alcohol consumption while taking diphenhydramine.

* **Can I take diphenhydramine with other medications?**  Diphenhydramine can interact with other medications, especially those that cause drowsiness or affect the central nervous system.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

* **How long does diphenhydramine take to work?** The effects of diphenhydramine typically start within 15-30 minutes after taking it orally.

* **What should I do if I overdose on diphenhydramine?**  Contact your local poison control center or emergency services immediately.  Overdose symptoms can include severe drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, and coma.

* **Is diphenhydramine safe for children?** Diphenhydramine can be used in children, but it should only be given under the supervision of a doctor.  The dosage is different for children compared to adults.

* **Is diphenhydramine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be under the guidance of a doctor as it can potentially cross the placental barrier and be present in breast milk.
