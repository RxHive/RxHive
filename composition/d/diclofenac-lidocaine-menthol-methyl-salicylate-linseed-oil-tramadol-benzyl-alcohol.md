# Diclofenac + Lidocaine + Menthol + Methyl Salicylate + Linseed Oil + Tramadol + Benzyl Alcohol

It's crucial to understand that a combination of Diclofenac, Lidocaine, Menthol, Methyl Salicylate, Linseed Oil, Tramadol, and Benzyl Alcohol is **not a standard or approved pharmaceutical formulation**.  Combining these ingredients in a single product would likely be incredibly risky and dangerous due to potential interactions and side effects.  Therefore, providing details about its "usage," "side effects," and "how it works" as a combined product is irresponsible and potentially harmful.  This combination should never be self-prescribed or prepared.

However, we can discuss the individual components and their typical uses and side effects:

**Individual Components and their typical properties:**
