# Desamino-oxytocin
### Generic Name
Desamino-oxytocin (also known as demoxytocin)

### Usage
Desamino-oxytocin is primarily used to induce labor in women whose labor is not progressing naturally.  It's also used to augment (strengthen) labor contractions when they are too weak or infrequent to effectively deliver the baby.  A secondary use is to stimulate lactation (milk production) in postpartum women who may be experiencing difficulties breastfeeding.  It has also shown potential in treating or preventing postpartum mastitis (breast inflammation), although this is less established than its other uses.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific indication (labor induction, augmentation, or lactation stimulation) and the patient's response.  It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional precisely.  Information below is for general understanding only and should not guide self-medication.

**Labor Induction (Buccal administration):**  Typically begins with 50 units every 30 minutes.  Once a normal contraction rhythm is established, the dose may be reduced to 25 units every 30 minutes.  The maximum dose is generally 500 units.

**Labor Augmentation (Buccal administration):**  The dose is usually 25 or 50 units, administered as needed every 30 minutes.

**Lactation Stimulation (Buccal administration):**  From the second to sixth postpartum day, 25-50 units (Â½ to 1 tablet) are administered 5 minutes before each breastfeeding session, 2-4 times a day.

**Pediatric Use:** Desamino-oxytocin is not indicated for use in children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Postpartum bleeding
* Neonatal jaundice
* Water retention
* Transient hypotension (low blood pressure) with flushing
* Reflex tachycardia (rapid heart rate, particularly with intravenous administration)

Serious but less common side effects that require immediate medical attention include:

* Anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions)
* Fatal afibrinogenemia (a serious blood clotting disorder)
* Maternal death due to severe hypertension
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)


Always consult a doctor immediately if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works
Desamino-oxytocin is a synthetic analog of oxytocin, a naturally occurring hormone in the body.  It works by binding to receptors in the uterine muscle, causing the muscles to contract more forcefully and frequently. This action is crucial in inducing and augmenting labor.  In the breasts, it promotes milk ejection and potentially reduces inflammation.  Its mechanism in preventing or treating postpartum mastitis is less fully understood but likely relates to its influence on blood flow and tissue healing.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Desamino-oxytocin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to desamino-oxytocin or other oxytocin-related drugs. It should not be used if there is fetal distress, significant cephalopelvic disproportion (mismatch between baby's size and mother's pelvis), unfavorable fetal presentation, excessive uterine distention, high parity (four or more previous pregnancies), a history of uterine surgery, severe toxemia, amniotic fluid embolism, hypertonic uterine contractions, placenta previa, cord presentation or prolapse, mechanical obstruction to delivery, or a predisposition to uterine rupture.

**Increased Risk:** High doses over a prolonged period may increase the risk of water intoxication.

**Use with Caution:**  Desamino-oxytocin should be used cautiously in women with borderline cephalopelvic disproportion, those over 35 years old, those with heart disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension, or a history of a lower segment Cesarean section. It should also be avoided if there's a risk of fetal-pelvic mismatch, secondary uterine inertia, or if fetal death or meconium-stained amniotic fluid is present.  Avoid concurrent use with prostaglandins and anesthetic drugs.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While used to stimulate lactation, careful monitoring and adherence to prescribed dosage are essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Always consult your healthcare provider.
