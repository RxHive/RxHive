# Durvalumab

**Generic Name:** Durvalumab

**Usage:** Durvalumab is a type of immunotherapy medication, specifically a monoclonal antibody.  Its primary use is in the treatment of several types of cancer, including:

* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):**  Specifically, it's used in patients with advanced NSCLC whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. It's also used in combination with chemotherapy in certain cases of advanced NSCLC.
* **Bladder cancer:** Used in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (a type of bladder cancer) after platinum-based chemotherapy.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):** Used in patients with advanced HCC after prior treatment with sorafenib.
* **Other cancers:** It is also being studied in clinical trials for other types of cancer.  The specific use will depend on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for the correct usage.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Durvalumab can cause side effects, which can vary in severity from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak
* **Diarrhea**
* **Nausea**
* **Constipation**
* **Rash**
* **Cough**
* **Decreased appetite**
* **Pneumonitis (lung inflammation):** This is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Infusion-related reactions:** These can include fever, chills, rash, itching, or shortness of breath.
* **Immune-related adverse events (irAEs):** These are side effects caused by the immune system's overreaction, and can affect various organs. They can be serious and include colitis (inflammation of the colon), hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), and endocrinopathies (disorders of the endocrine system).

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary greatly between individuals.  It's crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Durvalumab is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor.  PD-L1 is a protein found on some cancer cells. It helps cancer cells evade detection and destruction by the immune system. Durvalumab works by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor, PD-1, on immune cells (T cells). By blocking this interaction, Durvalumab helps unleash the immune system to attack and destroy cancer cells.

**FAQs:**
