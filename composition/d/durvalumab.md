# Durvalumab
### Generic Name
Durvalumab

### Usage

Durvalumab is a type of immunotherapy medication, specifically a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor.  Its primary use is in the treatment of certain cancers that have not responded well to other therapies or have progressed after prior treatments.  Specifically, it's approved for:

* **Urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer):**  Durvalumab is used for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (cancer that has spread beyond the bladder or cannot be surgically removed) that has progressed during or after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, or that progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant (before surgery) or adjuvant (after surgery) platinum-based chemotherapy.

* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):** Durvalumab treats unresectable (cannot be surgically removed) stage III NSCLC that hasn't progressed after receiving concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

* **Small cell lung cancer (SCLC):** In combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin, Durvalumab is used as a first-line treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).


### Dosage

Durvalumab is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage varies depending on the specific cancer being treated:

* **Urothelial Carcinoma:** The typical dose is 10 mg/kg given as an IV infusion over 60 minutes every two weeks until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

* **Unresectable Stage III NSCLC:**  The usual dose is 10 mg/kg given as an IV infusion every two weeks. Treatment continues until the disease progresses, unacceptable side effects develop, or a maximum of 12 months is reached.

* **Extensive-stage SCLC:** The dose is 1500 mg given intravenously in combination with chemotherapy every three weeks for four cycles. This is then followed by 1500 mg every four weeks as a single agent until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Durvalumab in children have not been established.

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose and adjust it as needed.


### Side Effects

Durvalumab can cause various side effects, ranging in severity.  Some common side effects include:

* Fatigue
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Infections

Less common, but more serious, side effects include:

* Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)
* Immune-related endocrine disorders (affecting thyroid, pituitary, adrenal glands)
* Serious allergic reactions

If you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Durvalumab works by blocking PD-L1, a protein found on some cancer cells and immune cells.  PD-L1 normally helps cancer cells evade detection and destruction by the immune system. By blocking PD-L1, Durvalumab allows the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells more effectively.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Durvalumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.

* **Immune-related adverse reactions:** Durvalumab can trigger immune-related side effects, including those mentioned in the side effects section.  Close monitoring is necessary.

* **Infections:**  The risk of infection is increased with Durvalumab because it affects the immune system.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Durvalumab is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to the potential harm to the fetus or infant.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least three months after the last dose.

* **Drug Interactions:**  While not extensively studied, the potential interactions of Durvalumab with other medications should be considered.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.
