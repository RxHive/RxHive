# Dextran + Sodium Chloride
### Generic Name
Dextran 40 + Sodium Chloride 0.9%

**Note:**  This combination is not a single, pre-packaged drug product with a universally standardized name.  The information below reflects the properties of Dextran 40 (a type of dextran) in combination with Sodium Chloride 0.9% (normal saline) solution, often used together intravenously.  The specific proportions and overall formulation might vary depending on the manufacturer and intended clinical application.  Always refer to the product monograph provided by the manufacturer for precise details.


### Usage

This intravenous (IV) combination is primarily used to expand plasma volume and improve blood circulation.  The dextran component acts as a plasma volume expander, increasing the fluid volume in the bloodstream.  Sodium Chloride 0.9% provides essential electrolytes and helps maintain fluid balance.  

Primary uses include:

* **Treatment of hypovolemic shock:**  This is a life-threatening condition characterized by dangerously low blood volume.  The combination helps restore blood volume and improve tissue perfusion.
* **Adjunctive therapy in surgery:** Used during and after surgical procedures to help maintain adequate blood volume and prevent or treat hypotension (low blood pressure).
* **Treatment of burns and trauma:** The combination can help replace fluid lost due to severe burns or traumatic injuries.


Secondary uses (may be employed depending on specific clinical context and physician's judgment):

* **Treatment of dehydration:** Although not the first-line treatment, it may be used in severe cases of dehydration when other routes of fluid administration are not feasible.



### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's age, weight, clinical condition (severity of hypovolemia, blood loss, etc.), and response to treatment.  It is *always* administered intravenously under strict medical supervision.

**There is no standardized pediatric or adult dosing for this specific combination; dosage is determined by the healthcare provider based on the individual's needs.**

The infusion rate and total volume of dextran 40 + sodium chloride 0.9% are carefully controlled by healthcare professionals to avoid fluid overload and other complications.  They continuously monitor the patient’s vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, urine output) during and after infusion.

**Important Note:** This combination is administered by healthcare professionals in a controlled medical setting; self-administration is extremely dangerous and strictly prohibited.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives)
* Swelling in extremities


Less common but serious side effects:

* Fluid overload (pulmonary edema)
* Anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction)
* Bleeding tendencies (due to interference with platelet function)
* Renal failure (kidney impairment)

If any side effects occur, especially if severe or worsening, immediately contact a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Dextran 40 is a large, complex sugar molecule that draws fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream, effectively increasing blood volume.  This raises blood pressure and improves tissue perfusion (blood flow to organs and tissues). Sodium chloride 0.9% is isotonic with body fluids, meaning it doesn’t cause a shift in fluid balance between compartments.  It primarily replaces electrolytes lost through blood loss or other means.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Patients with severe heart failure, renal impairment (kidney problems), bleeding disorders, or a known allergy to dextran should not receive this combination.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Dextran can interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners).  It’s crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks; consult with a healthcare professional.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to fluid overload and other adverse effects; careful monitoring is crucial.
* **Fluid overload:**  Closely monitor patients for signs of fluid overload such as shortness of breath, swelling, and increased blood pressure.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I store this medication at home?**  A: No. This combination is only administered intravenously in a hospital or medical facility. It cannot be stored at home.

* **Q: How long does the infusion typically last?** A: Infusion time varies widely depending on the patient's condition and the physician's orders. It can range from several hours to several days.

* **Q: Are there any alternatives to this treatment?** A: Yes, several other fluids and plasma expanders can be used to treat hypovolemia, depending on the specific situation. Your healthcare provider will determine the most appropriate option.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Immediately report any unusual symptoms to your healthcare provider.
