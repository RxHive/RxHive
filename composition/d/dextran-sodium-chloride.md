# Dextran + Sodium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Dextran 40 + Sodium Chloride (various concentrations available)

**Usage:** Dextran 40 in combination with sodium chloride is primarily used as a plasma volume expander in situations of hypovolemia (low blood volume).  This is often seen in cases of:

* **Shock:**  Traumatic, hemorrhagic, septic, and other types of shock.
* **Surgery:** To maintain adequate blood volume during and after surgery.
* **Burns:** To help manage fluid loss due to burns.
* **Dehydration:**  Severe dehydration that requires rapid fluid replacement.

The sodium chloride component provides electrolytes crucial for maintaining fluid balance and proper bodily functions.  The specific concentration of sodium chloride will vary depending on the preparation and the patient's needs.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can range from mild to severe and include:

* **Mild:** Headache, dizziness, flushing, chills, nausea, vomiting.
* **Moderate:**  Hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives), edema (swelling), increased bleeding tendency.
* **Severe:**  Anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), renal failure (kidney failure), thrombosis (blood clots).

**How it Works:**

* **Dextran 40:** This is a large, branched polysaccharide derived from bacterial fermentation of sucrose. It acts as a colloid, meaning it stays in the bloodstream for a longer period than crystalloid solutions (like saline alone). This prolonged presence in the blood increases blood volume and improves blood pressure by expanding plasma volume. It also improves blood flow by reducing blood viscosity.

* **Sodium Chloride:**  This provides sodium and chloride ions, essential electrolytes that are crucial for maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction.  It helps restore electrolyte levels that may be lost due to dehydration, blood loss, or other conditions.  The combination with dextran ensures that the fluid expansion is accompanied by the necessary electrolytes.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Dextran 40 + Sodium Chloride right for me?** Only a doctor can determine if this solution is appropriate for your specific condition.  It's a prescription medication and should only be administered under medical supervision.

* **How is it administered?** It's typically administered intravenously (IV) through a drip. The rate of infusion is carefully controlled by healthcare professionals.

* **Are there any drug interactions?**  There are potential interactions with certain medications, especially those affecting blood clotting or kidney function.  It is critical to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.

* **What are the long-term effects?**  Dextran 40 is generally used for short-term treatment of hypovolemia. Long-term use is uncommon and may carry additional risks.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Immediately report any unusual symptoms to your doctor or nurse.
