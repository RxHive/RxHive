# Dithranol
### Generic Name
Dithranol

### Usage
Dithranol is a topical medication primarily used to treat psoriasis, a chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, scaly patches.  It works by slowing down the rapid growth of skin cells that is characteristic of psoriasis. While its primary use is for psoriasis, it may sometimes be used off-label for other skin conditions like eczema, but this is less common and should only be done under the strict supervision of a dermatologist.  The effectiveness varies depending on the severity and location of the psoriasis.  It's important to note that dithranol is a potent medication and is not suitable for all types of psoriasis or all patients.

### Dosage
Dithranol is applied topically to the affected skin areas. Dosage and application frequency are highly individualized and determined by a doctor based on the severity of the psoriasis and the patient's skin tolerance.  There is no standard dosage across the board.

* **Initial Treatment:** Treatment usually begins with low-concentration dithranol (e.g., 0.1% to 0.25%) applied for short periods (e.g., 15-30 minutes) to assess skin tolerance.  This is gradually increased over time, both in concentration and duration of application, as tolerated.

* **Maintenance:** Once the initial tolerance is established, the doctor may increase the concentration of dithranol and the duration of application.  This might involve overnight applications or longer periods during the day, depending on individual needs and response.

* **Forms:** Dithranol is available in various forms, including ointments, creams, and pastes, each with varying concentrations. The choice of formulation depends on the severity and location of the psoriasis.

* **Children and Older Adults:** Use in children and older adults requires extra caution and careful monitoring by a doctor due to increased sensitivity of the skin. Lower concentrations and shorter application times are typically recommended.  Dithranol is not generally recommended for use on infants.

* **IV Administration:** Dithranol is not administered intravenously. It is solely for topical use.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of dithranol include:

* Skin irritation (redness, burning, itching)
* Staining of the skin (temporary, typically fading with time)
* Dryness and scaling of the skin
* Inflammation


Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Severe skin reactions (allergic reactions are rare)


If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, it is crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
Dithranol works by inhibiting the rapid cell proliferation that characterizes psoriasis.  It interferes with DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing skin cells, effectively slowing down the abnormal skin cell growth. This helps reduce the inflammation, scaling, and redness associated with the condition. The exact mechanism is complex and not fully understood, but its effect on cell growth is the primary way it achieves its therapeutic benefit.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Dithranol should not be used on broken skin or open wounds. It should also be avoided around the eyes, mouth, and genitals.

* **Drug Interactions:** Currently, there is no significant interaction documented with other medication known. However, it is always best to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of dithranol during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Careful monitoring is crucial in these situations.

* **Photosensitivity:** Dithranol can increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight.  Avoid prolonged sun exposure or use sunscreen during treatment.

* **Allergic Reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions can occur. Stop using dithranol and seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like severe itching, rash, or difficulty breathing.

* **Storage:** Store dithranol as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see results varies greatly depending on the severity of the psoriasis and individual response.  Improvement may be gradual and noticeable over weeks or even months.

* **Q: Will dithranol stain my clothes or bedding?** A: Yes, dithranol can stain fabric.  Use old clothes or towels while applying it and avoid contact with furniture.

* **Q: Can I use dithranol on my face?** A:  Generally, no.  The face's skin is more sensitive. It is best to avoid this area.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get dithranol in my eyes?** A: Rinse your eyes immediately with plenty of water and consult a doctor if irritation persists.

* **Q: Is dithranol safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use should only be determined by your doctor, as the risks and benefits need to be carefully assessed.  Consistent monitoring of your skin is important.
