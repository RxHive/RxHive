# Dithranol

**Generic Name:** Dithranol (also known as Anthralin)

**Usage:** Dithranol is a topical medication used to treat psoriasis, a chronic skin condition characterized by red, itchy, scaly patches. It's applied directly to the affected areas of the skin.  The concentration of dithranol used varies depending on the severity of the psoriasis and the individual's skin tolerance. Treatment typically starts with low concentrations and gradually increases as the skin tolerates it.  It's often used in conjunction with other treatments like emollients and corticosteroids.

**Side Effects:** Dithranol can cause significant skin irritation, and its use requires careful monitoring. Common side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:** Redness, burning, stinging, itching, and pain at the application site.  This is often dose-dependent; higher concentrations cause more irritation.
* **Staining:** Dithranol stains the skin (a yellowish-brown or brownish-purple discoloration), clothing, and linens. This staining can be persistent and difficult to remove.
* **Inflammation:** In some cases, more severe inflammation can occur.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.

More serious side effects are rare but can include:

* **Skin infections:** Secondary bacterial or fungal infections can develop due to skin irritation.


**How it Works:** Dithranol's exact mechanism of action in treating psoriasis isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by:

* **Reducing inflammation:** It helps to reduce the inflammation associated with psoriasis plaques.
* **Slowing cell growth:** It slows down the rapid growth of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis.
* **Modifying immune response:** It may influence the immune response contributing to the condition.

The effect is primarily localized to the area where it's applied.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Results vary depending on the severity of psoriasis and the individual's response to treatment. Improvement may be seen within a few weeks, but consistent use is often required for optimal results.

* **Q: How often should I apply dithranol?** A: The frequency and duration of application are determined by a dermatologist based on the individual's condition and tolerance.  It's usually applied once or twice daily.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe irritation?** A:  If you experience severe irritation, discontinue use immediately and consult your dermatologist.  They may adjust the concentration or frequency of application, or recommend alternative treatments.

* **Q: Can I use dithranol on my face or genitals?** A:  Dithranol is generally not recommended for use on sensitive areas like the face, genitals, or folds of skin due to the risk of severe irritation.
