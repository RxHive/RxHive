# Dihydralazine
### Generic Name
Dihydralazine

### Usage
Dihydralazine is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and reduces the workload on the heart.  While its primary use is in hypertension management, it's important to note that it's typically used in conjunction with other antihypertensive medications, rather than as a standalone treatment. This is often due to the potential for side effects and the need for careful monitoring.

### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for dihydralazine vary depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage.

* **Adults (Hypertension):** Oral administration (as the sulfate salt) usually starts with 25 mg twice daily (BID). The dosage may be gradually increased, but generally should not exceed 50 mg BID.  The increase is carefully monitored by a doctor based on blood pressure readings.

* **Children:** Dihydralazine is not typically used in children.  Pediatric use requires careful assessment and close medical supervision by a specialist.

* **Other Forms:** Dihydralazine is typically available as oral tablets. Injection forms may be used in specific situations under strict medical supervision.

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems. Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.


### Side Effects
Dihydralazine can cause several side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* Flushing (reddening of the skin)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up)

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome (a serious autoimmune disorder)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Blood disorders (e.g., anemia)
* Pulmonary infiltrates (fluid in the lungs)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Dihydralazine is a direct-acting vasodilator.  This means it directly relaxes the muscles in the walls of the arterioles (small arteries), causing them to widen. This widening reduces the resistance to blood flow, decreasing blood pressure.  The effect is more pronounced on diastolic blood pressure (the lower number in a blood pressure reading) than systolic blood pressure (the upper number).


### Precautions
Several precautions must be considered before and during dihydralazine treatment:

* **Contraindications:** Dihydralazine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, dissecting aortic aneurysm, severe tachycardia, certain types of heart failure, cor pulmonale, myocardial infarction due to mechanical obstruction, idiopathic SLE or related disorders, porphyria, and during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Dihydralazine can interact with other medications, including other blood pressure drugs, so informing your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking is essential.

* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with cerebrovascular disorders, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and renal or hepatic impairment.  The use of dihydralazine during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful evaluation of the risks and benefits by a healthcare professional.

* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood pressure, kidney function, and complete blood counts (CBC) may be necessary during dihydralazine treatment.  Liver function tests may also be indicated.
