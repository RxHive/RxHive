# Dihydralazine

**Generic Name:** Hydralazine

**Usage:**

Hydralazine is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's often used in combination with other medications, especially in severe hypertension or when other drugs haven't been effective enough on their own.  It's specifically a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels.  It's sometimes used in severe heart failure, but this is less common now due to newer, more effective treatments.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is a very frequent side effect.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Gastrointestinal upset is also relatively common.
* **Dizziness and lightheadedness:**  These can be related to the blood pressure lowering effect.
* **Palpitations:**  A feeling of a rapid or irregular heartbeat.
* **Flushing:**  Reddening of the skin, particularly in the face and neck.
* **Shortness of breath:**  In some cases, especially with higher doses.


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Lupus-like syndrome:** This is a rare but potentially serious autoimmune reaction mimicking symptoms of lupus (joint pain, fever, rash, etc.).  Regular monitoring is crucial if using hydralazine long-term.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Nerve damage, often presenting as numbness or tingling in the extremities.
* **Fluid retention:**  This can lead to swelling in the ankles and legs.
* **Angina (chest pain):**  Paradoxically, in some individuals, it can worsen angina.


**How it Works:**

Hydralazine primarily works by relaxing and widening the arterioles (small arteries).  This reduces the resistance to blood flow, thereby lowering blood pressure.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it involves the activation of guanylate cyclase and the subsequent production of cyclic GMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the blood vessels.


**FAQs:**

* **Is hydralazine safe during pregnancy?**  Hydralazine is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy in specific situations and under careful medical supervision. However, it should only be used when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the mother and fetus. A doctor will assess this on a case-by-case basis.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking hydralazine?**  Alcohol can exacerbate the hypotensive (blood pressure lowering) effects of hydralazine, increasing the risk of dizziness and lightheadedness.  Itâ€™s best to limit or avoid alcohol while on this medication.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Can I stop taking hydralazine suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking hydralazine suddenly.  Abrupt cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor will gradually reduce your dose over time to avoid this.

* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of hydralazine can be felt relatively quickly, however the full therapeutic effect may take several weeks to develop.
