# Darolutamide

**Generic Name:** Darolutamide

**Usage:** Darolutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen used in the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  It's typically used in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  It is *not* used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Hot flashes:** Sudden feelings of warmth, often accompanied by sweating.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Increased liver enzymes:** This is monitored through blood tests.  Elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver damage, though it's not always symptomatic.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or eruption.
* **Gynecomastia (breast enlargement):**  This is less common.
* **Fall risk:**  Increased risk of falls, especially in elderly patients.
* **Pneumonia:** Increased risk of pneumonia in some patients.


**Serious side effects, while less common, require immediate medical attention:**

* **Severe allergic reactions:** Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Liver damage:** Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice), dark urine, abdominal pain.
* **Seizures:**  Sudden, uncontrolled muscle contractions.


**How it Works:** Darolutamide works by blocking the effects of androgens (male hormones) on prostate cancer cells.  Androgens fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells. By blocking their action, darolutamide helps slow or stop the growth of the cancer.  It does this by competitively binding to the androgen receptor, preventing testosterone and other androgens from binding and stimulating cancer cell growth.
