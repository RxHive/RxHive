# Darolutamide
### Generic Name
Darolutamide

### Usage
Darolutamide is primarily used to treat non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  This means it's used in men with prostate cancer that hasn't spread to other parts of the body, but which continues to grow even after hormone therapy (castration) to lower testosterone levels.  It's typically used in combination with other treatments, such as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog,  to further suppress androgen activity and slow or stop the cancer's progression.  Currently, there are no other notable secondary uses approved.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for nmCRPC is 600 mg twice daily (BID), orally. This is usually given in combination with a GnRH analog if bilateral orchiectomy (surgical removal of the testicles) hasn't been performed. Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no dosage adjustment is needed.  For moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the dose should be reduced to 300 mg BID.  Dosage adjustments for severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C) are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No adjustment is necessary for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30-89 mL/min/1.73 m². For those with an eGFR of 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m² (not on dialysis), the dose should be reduced to 300 mg BID.  Adjustments for end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m²) are not provided in the labeling.
* **Toxicity:** If a patient experiences grade 3 or higher toxicity (or intolerable side effects), darolutamide should be withheld or the dose reduced to 300 mg BID until symptoms improve.  The drug may then be resumed at 600 mg BID.  Reducing the dose below 300 mg BID isn't recommended.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of darolutamide in children haven't been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased serum AST (liver enzyme) levels
* Increased serum bilirubin levels
* Asthenia (weakness or lack of energy)

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) include:

* Ischemic heart disease
* Cardiac failure
* Skin rash
* Limb pain

Other side effects, with frequency not defined, include hypertension, hematuria (blood in urine), urinary retention, and pneumonia.

**Serious Side Effects:**  Neutropenia and embryo-fetal toxicity are potential serious side effects.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Darolutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor.  Androgens, like testosterone, are hormones that stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Darolutamide works by blocking androgens from binding to the AR, preventing them from activating the genes that promote cancer cell growth.  This inhibition slows or stops the growth of prostate cancer cells.  A major metabolite, keto-darolutamide, also exhibits similar activity.  Darolutamide also acts as a weak progesterone receptor antagonist.

### Precautions
* **Contraindicated:** Darolutamide is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to darolutamide or any of its components.
* **Pregnancy:** Darolutamide can cause fetal harm and pregnancy loss. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Darolutamide can interact with many other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.  Specific interactions with drugs like alpelisib, asunaprevir, and several others are known.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Darolutamide is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function may require dose adjustments as described above.  Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function is important.
* **Infection Risk:**  Because darolutamide can lower white blood cell counts, increasing the risk of infection, prompt attention to any signs of infection is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking darolutamide?**  A:  While there aren't specific restrictions on alcohol consumption, excessive alcohol intake can negatively impact liver function, which is important to monitor during darolutamide treatment.  Discuss moderate alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider.
* **Q: How should I store darolutamide?** A: Store darolutamide at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Can I drive while taking darolutamide?** A:  Fatigue is a common side effect.  If experiencing fatigue, avoid driving or operating machinery.
* **Q: Is darolutamide safe for older adults?** A:  While darolutamide is used in older adults, close monitoring for side effects is important due to age-related changes in liver and kidney function.
