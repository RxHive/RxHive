# Dimercaprol

**Generic Name:** Dimercaprol

**Usage:** Dimercaprol is an antidote used to treat poisoning by certain heavy metals, specifically arsenic, mercury, and gold.  It's not used for all heavy metal poisonings, and its use is largely determined by the specific metal and the severity of poisoning.  It's administered by intramuscular injection, usually in a hospital setting, due to its significant side effects.

**Side Effects:** Dimercaprol has several notable side effects, which can be quite severe.  These can include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** Very common.
* **Increased blood pressure:** Can be significant.
* **Tachycardia (rapid heart rate):** Another cardiovascular effect.
* **Headache:** Frequent complaint.
* **Burning sensation at the injection site:** Local reaction.
* **Fever:**  Can be present.
* **Increased salivation:**  Another common side effect.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  Indicating potential liver damage.
* **Elevated blood glucose levels:**  Especially important for diabetics.
* **Rare but serious effects:**  These include  hepatitis (liver inflammation), renal (kidney) dysfunction, and in rare instances, even death (particularly with high doses).  Allergic reactions are also possible.


**How it Works:** Dimercaprol works by chelating (binding to) heavy metal ions. This creates a complex that is then more easily excreted from the body via the urine and feces.  Essentially, it acts as a "metal sponge," removing the toxic metal from tissues and preventing its further action.  The efficacy of dimercaprol varies depending on the specific heavy metal and the timing of administration.  Early intervention is critical for optimal results.


**FAQs:**

* **Is dimercaprol a first-line treatment for all heavy metal poisonings?** No.  Its use is specific to certain heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, gold) and determined by a physician based on the type and severity of the poisoning and the patient's overall condition.  Other chelating agents may be preferred for other metals (e.g., lead poisoning).

* **How is dimercaprol administered?**  It is usually given by intramuscular injection (into a muscle). It's not given orally.

* **What are the risks of using dimercaprol?**  The side effects can be significant, as listed above, and need careful monitoring by medical professionals. The potential benefits must outweigh the risks before administration.

* **Is dimercaprol available over the counter?** No. It's a prescription medication requiring careful medical supervision.

* **What should I do if I suspect heavy metal poisoning?**  Seek immediate medical attention.  Do not attempt self-treatment.
