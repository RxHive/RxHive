# Diclofenac

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac

**Usage:** Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  It's prescribed for a variety of conditions, including:

* **Osteoarthritis:**  Pain and inflammation in the joints.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:**  A form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine.
* **Acute gout:**  Sudden, severe attacks of joint pain.
* **Tendinitis and bursitis:**  Inflammation of tendons and bursae (fluid-filled sacs cushioning joints).
* **Menstrual cramps:**  Painful periods.
* **Post-surgical or post-traumatic pain:** Pain following surgery or injury.
* **Mild to moderate pain:** Such as headaches, toothaches, or muscle aches (although other analgesics are often preferred for these).

**Important Note:** Diclofenac should only be used as directed by a doctor.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, diclofenac can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal problems:**  Heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, ulcers, bleeding (rare but serious).
* **Fluid retention:** Swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Rash:**
* **Increased risk of cardiovascular events:**  Heart attack, stroke (this risk is increased with higher doses and longer duration of use).
* **Kidney problems:**  Especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare but serious.
* **Increased risk of bleeding:**  May increase the risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking blood thinners.


**How it Works:** Diclofenac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, diclofenac helps to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.

* **Is diclofenac safe for everyone?**  Diclofenac is not safe for everyone.  People with certain conditions, such as severe heart or kidney disease, active peptic ulcers, or a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs, should not take diclofenac.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it.
