# Doxylamine + Vitamin B
### Generic Name
Doxylamine succinate + Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6)


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy (morning sickness).  Doxylamine succinate is an antihistamine with sedative properties that helps to reduce nausea and vomiting. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is a vitamin that plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, and in this combination, it works synergistically with doxylamine to improve its effectiveness in managing pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting.  While this combination is most commonly used for morning sickness, it's crucial to remember that it should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Other uses may exist but are not as widely established or studied.  **Never self-medicate, and always consult a doctor before starting this or any medication.**


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation and the prescribing healthcare professional’s recommendations.  Generally, a physician will prescribe a specific amount of doxylamine and pyridoxine to take orally before bed.  

* **Adults (Morning Sickness):** The typical dose is as directed by the prescribing physician, often starting with a lower dose and then gradually increasing as needed.  There is no standard "over the counter" dose for this specific combination, it's always prescription-only for this purpose.

* **Children:** This combination is generally **not recommended for children**, as safety and efficacy haven't been established in pediatric populations.

* **Oral Administration:** This medication is taken orally. It’s usually best to take this medication at bedtime due to its sedative effects.

* **IV Administration:** This combination is not available in an intravenous (IV) form.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Rapid heartbeat, difficulty urinating, confusion, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).

* **Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Doxylamine succinate, an antihistamine, works by blocking histamine receptors in the brain.  Histamine can contribute to nausea and vomiting. By blocking these receptors, doxylamine reduces these symptoms. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is thought to play a role in serotonin metabolism, a neurotransmitter related to nausea.  The exact mechanism of how pyridoxine improves nausea symptoms alongside doxylamine isn't fully understood but the combination seems to have better effects than doxylamine alone for pregnancy-related nausea.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While this combination is commonly used for morning sickness, it's essential to discuss its use with your doctor, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Breastfeeding mothers should also consult their doctor.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination can interact with other medications, including sedatives, antidepressants, and other antihistamines. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as it can enhance the sedative effects.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication, particularly drowsiness.

* **Pre-existing Conditions:** Individuals with certain medical conditions, such as glaucoma, prostate problems, or difficulty urinating, should exercise caution and inform their doctor before taking this medicine.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you, as drowsiness is a common side effect.
