# Diclofenac + Metaxalone
### Generic Name
Diclofenac + Metaxalone (Combination)

**Note:**  Diclofenac and metaxalone are typically prescribed as separate medications, not always in a fixed-dose combination.  The information below pertains to the individual actions of each drug when used together, as the precise formulation and dosage will vary depending on the specific brand and manufacturer. Always refer to the prescribing information provided with your specific medication.


### Usage

This combination medication is typically prescribed to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions.  Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), targets inflammation, while metaxalone, a skeletal muscle relaxant, addresses muscle spasms and pain.  Therefore, this combination is often used to manage:

* **Acute musculoskeletal pain:** This includes pain stemming from injuries like strains, sprains, and minor trauma.
* **Chronic musculoskeletal pain:** This applies to ongoing pain from conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (in conjunction with other disease-modifying treatments), and fibromyalgia (often as an adjunctive therapy).
* **Post-surgical pain:** It may be used for a limited period post-surgery to manage pain and inflammation in the affected area.

It's crucial to understand that this combination doesn't cure the underlying condition; it manages the symptoms.  The specific conditions this combination treats depend heavily on the physician's assessment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific formulation, the manufacturer, and the patient's individual needs.  There is no standard combination product with set ratios.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose of each component (Diclofenac and Metaxalone) separately.

**Diclofenac:** Can be administered orally (tablets, capsules) or via injection (IV).  Dosage for oral administration is usually determined by the condition's severity and the patient's weight and other medical conditions. Typical oral doses range from 50mg to 150mg daily, divided into doses.  IV doses are administered under strict medical supervision and are specific to the clinical situation.  Children's dosage must be determined by a physician based on weight and age, always keeping in mind that NSAIDs are not recommended for young children unless medically essential.

**Metaxalone:** Usually taken orally as tablets or capsules. Adult dosages are typically in the range of 800mg to 1600mg daily, divided into several doses. Children's dosage is not clearly established and is not recommended without specific prescription from a pediatrician.  Metaxalone is not administered intravenously.

**Important Note:**  Never adjust the dosage of either medication without consulting your doctor.

If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as serious, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

**Diclofenac:** Works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, diclofenac lessens pain and inflammation at the site of injury or disease.

**Metaxalone:**  The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to act on the central nervous system to relax skeletal muscles, thus alleviating muscle spasms and associated pain.  It may also influence the transmission of pain signals.


### Precautions

* **Pregnant women:**  Use during pregnancy is generally avoided, especially during the third trimester.  Consult your doctor.
* **Breastfeeding mothers:** Discuss use with your doctor as the drugs may pass into breast milk.
* **Liver or kidney disease:**  This combination may exacerbate existing liver or kidney problems.  Use requires careful monitoring by a physician.
* **Heart conditions:** Diclofenac can increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Individuals with heart conditions should use this medication with caution under strict medical supervision.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption as it can increase the risk of stomach upset and other side effects.
* **Driving and operating machinery:** Metaxalone can cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
* **Older adults:** Older adults are more susceptible to side effects, especially bleeding and kidney problems.  They should be carefully monitored during treatment.
