# Diclofenac + Metaxalone

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Metaxalone

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders.  Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces pain and inflammation. Metaxalone is a muscle relaxant that helps relieve muscle spasms and stiffness.  The combination is often prescribed for conditions like back pain, neck pain, and other types of musculoskeletal pain accompanied by muscle spasms.  **It is crucial to note that this is not an over-the-counter medication and requires a prescription from a doctor.**  The doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment based on the individual's condition and medical history.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects can include:

* **From Diclofenac:**  Stomach upset (indigestion, heartburn, nausea, vomiting), constipation, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, increased risk of bleeding (especially in the stomach and intestines), fluid retention, high blood pressure, rash, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis in rare cases).  More serious side effects, though less common, include kidney problems, liver problems, and heart problems (including heart attack and stroke).

* **From Metaxalone:** Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, weakness, blurred vision.  Less common but more serious side effects include allergic reactions.

The combination of the two drugs can also increase the risk of certain side effects, particularly those related to the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular system.


**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:**  Reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.

* **Metaxalone:**  The exact mechanism of action of metaxalone is not fully understood, but it's believed to act on the central nervous system to relax muscles and relieve muscle spasms.
