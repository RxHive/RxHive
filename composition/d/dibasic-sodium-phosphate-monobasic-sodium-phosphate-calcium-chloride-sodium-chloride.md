# Dibasic sodium phosphate + Monobasic sodium phosphate + Calcium Chloride + Sodium Chloride
### Generic Name:  Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) Solution

This isn't a single drug with a specific generic name like "ibuprofen" or "amoxicillin."  Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) is a solution, a mixture of several salts, used primarily as a physiological buffer in various medical and biological applications.  It doesn't treat a specific disease in the way a typical medication does.  The individual components — dibasic sodium phosphate, monobasic sodium phosphate, calcium chloride, and sodium chloride — contribute to its properties.


### Usage

PBS's primary use is as a physiological buffer and isotonic solution. This means it maintains a stable pH (around 7.4) and osmotic pressure similar to that of human blood plasma or other bodily fluids.  Therefore, its uses are widespread and include:

* **In vitro cell culture:** PBS is commonly used to rinse or wash cells in cell culture without harming them.
* **Drug delivery:** It serves as a diluent or solvent for dissolving and administering certain medications or biological agents.
* **Biological research:**  Used in many laboratory techniques such as washing tissues, preparing samples for analysis, or as a component of reagent solutions.
* **Medical procedures:** It can be used for flushing wounds or catheters, though other solutions might be preferred in specific clinical situations.
* **Diagnostic testing:**  Used in some diagnostic tests to prepare samples or maintain physiological conditions.


### Dosage

There isn't a standardized "dosage" for PBS as a medicine. The concentration and volume used depend entirely on the specific application.  For example, the concentration used for rinsing cells in a petri dish will be drastically different from the concentration used (if at all) as a clinical diluent.  Formulations vary greatly based on the needs of the procedure or research.  Instructions are always provided as part of the specific protocol or application.

### Side Effects

As a simple saline solution, PBS is generally considered safe for external use, such as rinsing wounds or tissues.  However, direct injection or intravenous administration should only be done under strict medical supervision and is generally only done for specific procedures where carefully controlled solutions are necessary.  Adverse effects are rare but could theoretically include:

* **Irritation:** Localized irritation at the injection site (if injected) is possible, though usually mild.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although extremely rare, some individuals might display hypersensitivity reactions.

*Note:* This is not an exhaustive list, and side effects are highly dependent on the route of administration and context of usage.


### How it Works

PBS works by maintaining physiological conditions. The combination of salts creates a buffer system, meaning it resists changes in pH.  The ionic composition makes it isotonic, preventing damage to cells by osmotic shock (the sudden influx or efflux of water).  The individual components contribute to these effects:

* **Phosphates:** Act as the buffering agents, resisting changes in pH.
* **Sodium chloride:** Contributes to the solution's isotonicity and ionic balance.
* **Calcium chloride:** In some formulations, adds calcium ions, which are important for certain cellular processes.

### Precautions

* **Sterility:** For applications involving living tissues or injection, only sterile PBS should be used. Non-sterile PBS is unacceptable for any application involving contact with the human body.
* **Concentration:** The appropriate concentration of PBS should always be carefully considered based on the intended use and should be rigorously followed. Incorrect concentrations can damage cells or compromise the integrity of a procedure.
* **Intravenous administration:** IV use should only be carried out under strict medical supervision and following protocols established by a qualified physician.
* **Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are unlikely, but caution should be exercised if using PBS as a diluent for drugs.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use PBS from a lab setting for medical purposes at home?** A: No, absolutely not.  Lab-grade PBS is not sterile and is for research use only.  Using it on wounds or injecting it could lead to serious infections.
* **Q: Is PBS the same as saline solution?** A:  While both are salt solutions, they're not identical. Saline usually consists primarily of sodium chloride, while PBS includes phosphates for buffering.
* **Q: How is PBS stored?** A: Stored at room temperature if not sterile. Sterile solutions are generally refrigerated. Always check the label for specific storage instructions.
* **Q: Can I buy PBS over the counter?** A:  You might find PBS solutions for laboratory use, but not for general medical purposes.  It’s not typically sold as an over-the-counter medication.  You should not attempt to acquire or use PBS for medical purposes without explicit instructions from a healthcare provider.
