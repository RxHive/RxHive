# Doxylamine + Pyridoxal- + L-Methyl Folate Calcium
### Generic Name
Doxylamine Succinate + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + L-Methylfolate Calcium

**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination drug readily available by this exact name.  The components (doxylamine, pyridoxine, and L-methylfolate) are often found individually or in various combinations within different supplements or medications, often tailored for specific purposes like nausea relief during pregnancy or managing certain neurological conditions.  The information below is based on the individual actions of each component, not a specific product labeled as "Doxylamine Succinate + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + L-Methylfolate Calcium."  Always consult a healthcare professional or pharmacist for guidance on any specific product containing these ingredients.


### Usage

This combination of ingredients is not a standard FDA-approved combination, and its use would be dependent on the specific formulation and the physician's prescription or recommendation.  However, each component has its uses:

* **Doxylamine Succinate:** This is an antihistamine primarily used as a sedating sleep aid. It's also sometimes used to treat nausea and vomiting, particularly in the context of pregnancy-related nausea (though usually in combination with other medications).

* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):**  An essential vitamin with many functions in the body. It plays a vital role in brain development, nerve function, and the metabolism of amino acids. It's also used in treating certain types of nausea and vomiting, particularly morning sickness, often in conjunction with other medications like doxylamine.

* **L-Methylfolate Calcium:**  This is an active form of folate (vitamin B9).  Unlike folic acid, it doesn't require conversion in the body to be utilized. It's important for cell growth and development, and has been studied for its potential role in managing certain neurological conditions and improving mood.

The combined use of these three ingredients might be considered in specific circumstances, such as to manage nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, although this would be based on a doctor's recommendation and not as a standard, readily available combination.


### Dosage

Because this is not a standard combination, there's no single "official" dosage.  Dosage of each component would be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and the specific formulation used.  Information below reflects typical dosages for each ingredient *individually*:

* **Doxylamine Succinate:**  Dosages vary widely based on the indication. For sleep, itâ€™s often 25 mg at bedtime for adults.  Children's dosages are significantly lower and must be determined by a doctor.  This medication is not for intravenous use.

* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride:** Recommended daily allowances vary by age and sex.  Therapeutic dosages for nausea might be higher, but these should be determined by a doctor.  This is usually administered orally.  Intravenous administration is possible but requires medical supervision.

* **L-Methylfolate Calcium:**  Dosage depends on the reason for supplementation.  It is generally available as an oral supplement, and dosages vary based on individual needs and the health professional's recommendations.  Intravenous administration is possible in specific medical settings.


### Side Effects

Side effects will vary depending on the specific formulation and individual sensitivity.  Possible side effects for each component include:

* **Doxylamine Succinate:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, blurred vision.  Less common, but serious side effects may include allergic reactions, fast heartbeat, or urinary retention.

* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride:** At high doses, some individuals might experience nausea, vomiting, or numbness in their extremities.  Allergic reactions are rare.

* **L-Methylfolate Calcium:** Generally well-tolerated.  However, some individuals might experience mild gastrointestinal upset such as nausea or diarrhea. Allergic reactions are rare.


### How it Works

* **Doxylamine Succinate:** Blocks the action of histamine in the brain, leading to sedation and reducing nausea.

* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride:** Involved in numerous metabolic processes; its action in relieving nausea is not fully understood but might be related to its role in neurotransmitter synthesis.

* **L-Methylfolate Calcium:** Acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic pathways, critical for cell growth and development, and may exert beneficial effects on the nervous system.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Doxylamine should be avoided in individuals with certain conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, stomach or bowel obstruction, or difficulty urinating.  Specific contraindications for Pyridoxine and L-methylfolate are less common but should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Doxylamine can interact with other medications that cause drowsiness or affect the central nervous system.  Pyridoxine can interact with certain medications, such as levodopa. L-methylfolate interactions are relatively uncommon.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before taking this combination during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. While individually, these vitamins/medications might be used under medical supervision during pregnancy, the combined use requires specific evaluation.

* **Children and Older Adults:** Dosages for children and older adults need careful adjustment based on their individual health status and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.
