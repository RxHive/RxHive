# Domperidone + Famotidine
### Generic Name: Domperidone + Famotidine

This combination medication isn't typically found as a single, pre-mixed generic.  Domperidone and famotidine are usually prescribed separately, though sometimes a doctor might prescribe them together to address specific symptoms.  Therefore, this information will cover each drug individually and then discuss their combined effects.


### Usage

**Domperidone:** This medication is a dopamine antagonist primarily used to treat nausea and vomiting.  It works by blocking the action of dopamine in the brain, which helps to reduce the signals that trigger nausea and vomiting.  It's often used for conditions like gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying), post-operative nausea and vomiting, and nausea associated with certain medications.  

**Famotidine:** This is an H2-receptor antagonist, commonly used to reduce stomach acid production.  Its primary uses include treating and preventing heartburn, acid indigestion, and ulcers (both gastric and duodenal). It's also sometimes used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

**Combined Use:** A doctor might prescribe both domperidone and famotidine together when a patient experiences both nausea/vomiting and excessive stomach acid. For example, someone with GERD who also suffers from nausea could benefit from this combination.  The domperidone addresses the nausea, while the famotidine tackles the excess stomach acid.


### Dosage

Dosage for both domperidone and famotidine will vary based on the individual's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription exactly.  

**Domperidone:**  Dosage forms include tablets and oral suspensions (liquids).  Adult dosages typically range from 10-20mg three or four times daily, but this can vary widely depending on the condition.  Children's dosages require careful calculation based on weight and should be prescribed and supervised by a physician. IV administration is not common for Domperidone.


**Famotidine:** Dosage forms include tablets, capsules, and injections (IV).  Adult oral dosages for heartburn and ulcers are often 20mg once or twice daily. Higher doses might be prescribed in certain cases.  IV administration is commonly used in hospitals for more severe conditions or when oral medication isn't feasible.  Pediatric dosages are determined based on weight and medical condition and should be prescribed by a physician.


**Important:**  Never adjust dosages without consulting your physician.  The combined use of these medications requires careful monitoring.


### Side Effects

**Domperidone:** Common side effects can include headache, diarrhea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Less common, but more serious, side effects may involve changes in heart rhythm (prolonged QT interval) â€“ which requires immediate medical attention.

**Famotidine:** Common side effects are generally mild and include headache, constipation, diarrhea, and dizziness.


### How it Works

**Domperidone:** This drug works by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain, which is involved in triggering nausea and vomiting.  It also increases the motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract, helping to move food through the stomach more efficiently.


**Famotidine:** This medication works by blocking H2 receptors on the parietal cells in the stomach lining. These receptors normally stimulate the secretion of stomach acid.  By blocking these receptors, famotidine decreases the amount of acid produced, relieving symptoms associated with excess acidity.


### Precautions

**Domperidone:**  This medication should be used cautiously in individuals with certain heart conditions, liver or kidney problems, and those taking certain other medications (particularly those prolonging the QT interval).  It is generally not recommended for long-term use due to the potential risk of heart-related side effects.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and physician consultation.


**Famotidine:** While generally safe, famotidine can interact with other medications.  It should be used cautiously in individuals with kidney or liver problems.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding considerations are important factors and require physician guidance.


**Combined Use Precautions:** The combination of domperidone and famotidine requires close monitoring by a physician due to the potential for drug interactions and the potential for side effects from each individual drug.
