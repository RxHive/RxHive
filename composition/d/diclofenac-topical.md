# Diclofenac (Topical)
### Generic Name
Diclofenac (Topical)

### Usage

Diclofenac topical is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat various conditions involving pain and inflammation.  Its primary use is for the topical treatment of acute pain from minor injuries like strains, sprains, and contusions (bruises). It's also effective in relieving osteoarthritis pain in joints suitable for topical treatment (ankles, elbows, feet, hands, knees, and wrists).  Additionally, diclofenac topical is used in the treatment of actinic keratosis (precancerous skin lesions), usually in conjunction with sun avoidance measures.  It's crucial to remember that topical diclofenac only treats localized pain and inflammation; it doesn't address the underlying cause of the condition.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (gel, solution, patch), the condition being treated, and the patient's age. Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.  Information below is for general knowledge and should not replace professional medical advice.


**Adults:**

* **Acute Pain (strains, sprains, contusions):**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the concentration and formulation.  Patches are typically applied twice daily (BID). Gels are usually applied 2-4 grams to the affected area 3-4 times daily (TID or QID) for up to 7 days, with specific instructions varying by concentration.

* **Arthritis Pain:**  Over-the-counter (OTC) gels (1%) may be used on the affected area several times a day (QID), but the total daily dose and duration of use are limited. Prescription (Rx) gels may have higher concentrations and different dosage instructions.


* **Osteoarthritis:**  Similar to arthritis pain, dosage varies depending on the formulation and the joint(s) affected. Specific daily maximum doses are usually defined in the prescription.


* **Actinic Keratosis:** The 3% gel is usually applied twice daily to the affected area for 60-90 days.

**Children:**

Topical diclofenac is generally not recommended for young children.  For older children and adolescents (age and weight dependent), usage is usually under strict medical supervision, and the dosage is carefully adjusted based on age and the area affected.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems.  In cases of severe liver or kidney impairment, topical diclofenac may be contraindicated.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any pre-existing medical conditions.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are usually mild and localized to the application site.  These can include:

* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash
* Burning or stinging sensation
* Redness (erythema)
* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* Contact dermatitis

Less common, but more serious side effects may occur and necessitate immediate medical attention.  These can include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Liver damage
* Gastrointestinal problems (though less likely with topical application than oral NSAIDs)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, molecules that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production at the site of application, diclofenac helps alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.  The effects are generally localized to the area where the medication is applied.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not use diclofenac topical if you are allergic to diclofenac, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Topical diclofenac should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Skin Conditions:** Do not apply to broken skin, open wounds, or infected areas.
* **Other Medications:** Tell your doctor about all other medications you are taking, as there can be interactions.
* **Sun Sensitivity:**  Avoid prolonged sun exposure to treated areas.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.
* **Elderly:** Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects.


### FAQs

* **Can I use topical diclofenac with other topical medications?** It's generally not recommended to use multiple topical medications on the same area simultaneously without consulting your doctor.

* **How should I store topical diclofenac?** Store it as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

* **How long does it take to work?**  Pain relief may begin within a few hours, but full effects may take several days.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
