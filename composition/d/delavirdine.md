# Delavirdine
### Generic Name
Delavirdine

### Usage
Delavirdine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used to treat HIV-1 infection.  It's crucial to understand that Delavirdine is *not* used as a monotherapy.  It must always be administered as part of a combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, typically including at least two other antiretroviral drugs. This combination approach is essential for effective HIV management and to reduce the risk of developing drug resistance.  The primary goal of Delavirdine, in combination with other medications, is to suppress the HIV viral load and improve the CD4+ T-cell count, thereby slowing the progression of HIV disease and improving the patient's overall health.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (HIV-1 infection, part of a combination regimen):**  The usual adult dose is 400 mg three times daily (TID) orally.  This dosage should be strictly adhered to as prescribed by a healthcare professional.

**Pediatric Dosage (HIV-1 infection, part of a combination regimen):**  For adolescents aged 16 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults (400 mg TID).  Delavirdine is generally not recommended for use in children younger than 16 years.  Dosage adjustments for children must be made under the strict guidance of a pediatrician experienced in managing HIV in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with liver problems, and close monitoring is necessary.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before administering Delavirdine to individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
* Changes in blood cell counts (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Psychiatric effects (e.g., depression, anxiety, hallucinations)
* Cardiac arrhythmias

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly if they are severe or persistent, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Delavirdine works by inhibiting the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, a crucial enzyme that the virus uses to convert its RNA genetic material into DNA.  This DNA is then integrated into the host cell's DNA, allowing the virus to replicate. By blocking reverse transcriptase, Delavirdine prevents the virus from replicating, thus reducing the viral load and slowing the progression of the disease.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Delavirdine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.  It's also contraindicated for concurrent use with certain medications, including alprazolam, astemizole, cisapride, ergot alkaloids, midazolam, pimozide, rifampin, terfenadine, and triazolam, due to potential for serious drug interactions.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Delavirdine interacts with many other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Delavirdine.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Delavirdine is categorized as pregnancy Category C.  The benefits of using this medication during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against potential risks to the fetus.  It's unknown whether Delavirdine is excreted in breast milk.  A healthcare provider should be consulted to discuss the risks and benefits in pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised when using Delavirdine in patients with liver or kidney disease.  Close monitoring may be needed.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking Delavirdine.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Delavirdine if I feel better?** A: No.  Stopping Delavirdine prematurely can lead to drug resistance and worsen the HIV infection.  Continue taking the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel well.
* **Q: How should I store Delavirdine?** A: Store Delavirdine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can Delavirdine cure HIV?** A: No.  Delavirdine is not a cure for HIV. It's used to manage the infection and slow its progression.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Delavirdine?** A: Individuals with achlorhydria (low stomach acid) should take Delavirdine with an acidic beverage.  Antacids should be avoided within one hour of taking Delavirdine.
