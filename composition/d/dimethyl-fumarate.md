# Dimethyl fumarate

**Generic Name:** Dimethyl fumarate

**Usage:** Dimethyl fumarate is used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS).  It's also being investigated for other autoimmune diseases.

**Side Effects:** Dimethyl fumarate can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Flushing (reddening of the skin), nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting. These are often mild and may lessen over time.
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Lymphopenia (low white blood cell count), which increases the risk of infection;  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection;  Gastrointestinal perforation (hole in the gut); Liver damage;  Increased risk of skin cancer; Worsening of pre-existing skin conditions.

It's crucial to note that not everyone experiences these side effects, and their severity can vary.  Regular monitoring by a doctor is essential to detect and manage any potential problems.

**How it Works:** The exact mechanism by which dimethyl fumarate works in MS is not fully understood, but it's believed to act through multiple pathways:

* **Anti-inflammatory effects:** It reduces inflammation in the central nervous system, a key feature of MS.
* **Neuroprotective effects:** It may help protect nerve cells from damage.
* **Immunomodulatory effects:** It modifies the activity of the immune system, reducing its attack on the myelin sheath (the protective covering of nerve fibers) in the brain and spinal cord.  This modulation occurs through several complex processes, including affecting T-cell function and reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
