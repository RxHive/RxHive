# Dimethyl Fumarate
### Generic Name
Dimethyl Fumarate

### Usage
Dimethyl fumarate is primarily used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).  Relapsing MS is characterized by periods of worsening symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of partial or complete recovery.  Dimethyl fumarate helps to reduce the frequency and severity of these relapses and slows the progression of disability in people with this condition.  It's important to note that dimethyl fumarate does not cure MS, but rather manages its symptoms and progression.


### Dosage

**Multiple Sclerosis (Adults):** Dimethyl fumarate is administered orally. The typical dosage regimen involves starting with 120 mg twice daily (BID) for seven days. After this initial period, the dose is increased to the maintenance dose of 240 mg BID.  Some individuals may experience side effects and require temporary dose reduction to 120 mg BID.  If tolerated, the 240 mg BID dose should be resumed within four weeks.  If the patient cannot tolerate a return to the maintenance dose, discontinuation of the medication should be considered.  To help mitigate flushing, a common side effect, premedication with non-enteric-coated aspirin (up to 325mg) 30 minutes before taking dimethyl fumarate may be considered.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of dimethyl fumarate in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are typically necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, dose reductions or treatment interruption may be considered in cases of significant side effects, such as persistent flushing, gastrointestinal intolerance, lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count), clinically significant hepatic injury, or serious infection.  Specific adjustments are determined on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Flushing (redness of the skin)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Infections


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**

* Skin rash, itching (pruritus), and skin redness (erythema)
* Albuminuria (protein in the urine)
* Vomiting
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Lymphopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (AST)
*  Serious adverse events such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, various infections (including opportunistic infections), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and hepatic injury have been reported, although they occur less frequently.


**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, consult your doctor or other healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

The precise mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate isn't fully understood. However, it's believed that dimethyl fumarate and its active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF), work by activating Nrf2 pathways.  These pathways play a crucial role in the body's response to oxidative stress â€“ an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the body's ability to counteract them. By activating Nrf2, dimethyl fumarate may reduce inflammation and offer cytoprotection (protection of cells from damage). This helps to manage the inflammation and neurodegeneration associated with MS.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dimethyl fumarate is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (such as anaphylaxis or angioedema) to dimethyl fumarate or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients taking dimethyl fumarate have an increased risk of developing anaphylaxis, angioedema, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), lymphopenia, flushing, dermatitis, gastrointestinal events, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), proteinuria, and infections. Close monitoring is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dimethyl fumarate is categorized as pregnancy category C. This means that the potential risks to the developing fetus are unknown.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It is unknown if dimethyl fumarate is excreted in breast milk, therefore, caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:**  Potential drug interactions may exist. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting dimethyl fumarate.
* **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests (complete blood count, including lymphocyte count, and liver function tests) and urinalysis may be necessary to monitor for potential side effects.  MRI scans may be used to monitor for PML.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dimethyl fumarate with food?** A:  Dimethyl fumarate can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: Should I crush or chew the capsules?** A: No, dimethyl fumarate capsules should be swallowed whole and intact.  Do not crush, chew, or open the capsules.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store dimethyl fumarate?** A: Store dimethyl fumarate at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or other healthcare professional immediately if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.
