# Darunavir + Cobicistat
### Generic Name
Darunavir + Cobicistat

### Usage

Darunavir + Cobicistat is a combination drug used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's a crucial part of antiretroviral therapy (ART), meaning it's always used in conjunction with other antiretroviral medications, not on its own.  This combination therapy is prescribed for both treatment-naive adults and children (weighing at least 40 kg) and treatment-experienced adults who don't have HIV strains resistant to darunavir.  The primary goal is to suppress the HIV viral load, improving the patient's immune system and overall health.  It's important to note that this drug doesn't cure HIV, but effectively manages it.

### Dosage

Dosage is determined by the patient's weight and treatment history.  Genotype testing (to check for drug resistance) is recommended before starting the medication in treatment-experienced patients.

* **Adults (Treatment-Naive or Experienced without Darunavir Resistance):**  The standard dose is one 800 mg darunavir/150 mg cobicistat tablet once daily, taken with food.  This is always combined with other antiretroviral medications.  There's a specific caution:  This combination should not be used with abacavir and lamivudine in patients with a pre-treatment HIV RNA level of 100,000 copies/mL or higher.

* **Children and Adolescents (≥40 kg):** The dosage is the same as for adults: one 800 mg darunavir/150 mg cobicistat tablet once daily, administered with food and in combination with other antiretroviral medications.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B). However, data on darunavir and cobicistat individually suggest no adjustment is necessary.  Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) is a contraindication.  Renal impairment may also require dose adjustments or alternative medication choices depending on the creatinine clearance (CrCl); it is not recommended to co-administer with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate if the CrCl is <70 mL/minute.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are not specifically defined in the provided data, but the medication may cause immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, and hepatotoxicity.

Less common but serious side effects include severe skin reactions, effects on serum creatinine, and new-onset or worsening renal impairment (especially when used with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).

**If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Darunavir is a protease inhibitor. It works by blocking the HIV-1 protease enzyme. This enzyme is essential for the virus to create new copies of itself. By inhibiting the protease, darunavir prevents the virus from maturing and replicating. Cobicistat is a CYP3A inhibitor which boosts the levels of darunavir in the body by preventing its breakdown, ensuring sufficient drug levels to effectively suppress the virus.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Darunavir + Cobicistat should not be used with several other medications, including (but not limited to) alfuzosin, carbamazepine, colchicine (in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment), dronedarone, ergot derivatives, ivabradine, lomitapide, lovastatin, lurasidone, oral midazolam, naloxegol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, pimozide, ranolazine, rifampin, sildenafil (for pulmonary arterial hypertension), simvastatin, St. John's Wort, and triazolam.  Consult a healthcare provider for a complete list.

* **Interactions:**  This medication interacts with many other drugs.  This may lead to decreased effectiveness of either the darunavir/cobicistat or the interacting medication, or increased risk of side effects.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Darunavir + Cobicistat is a Category C pregnancy drug, meaning the risks are not fully understood. It’s not recommended for use during pregnancy, and an alternative regimen should be considered. It's unknown whether it is excreted in breast milk, use with caution if breastfeeding.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Careful monitoring of liver and kidney function is necessary, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions.

* **Allergies:** Use with caution in individuals with sulfonamide allergies.

* **Other Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with hemophilia A or B, or underlying hepatic disease.
