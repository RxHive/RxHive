# Dexamethasone + Tobramycin
### Generic Name
Dexamethasone + Tobramycin

### Usage

Dexamethasone and Tobramycin combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial infections of the eye and its surrounding structures.  Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling, while Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that fights bacterial infections. The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial actions, targeting the dual symptoms of bacterial eye infections.  While primarily used for conjunctivitis, this combination may sometimes be prescribed for other eye infections as directed by an ophthalmologist, depending on the specific bacteria identified.  It is crucial to remember this medication is only effective against bacterial infections; it won't work for viral or fungal eye infections.

### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary significantly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., eye drops, ointment) and the severity of the infection.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or ophthalmologist.  There is no standard "children's dose" as it's generally not used in very young children,  the use in children would be determined solely by a physician.

**Typical Dosage (Adult & Child - as prescribed by physician):**

* **Eye Drops:** The usual dose is one to two drops in the affected eye(s) every 2 to 4 hours, as directed by your doctor.
* **Eye Ointment:** A small ribbon of ointment is applied to the affected eye(s) typically 2 to 4 times daily.

**Important Note:**  Never exceed the prescribed dosage. Incorrect or excessive use can lead to side effects and may not improve the outcome.  For children, the dosage will be determined by the ophthalmologist based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Burning or stinging sensation in the eye, temporary blurred vision, mild eye irritation.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Increased eye pressure (glaucoma), eye pain, vision changes (beyond temporary blurriness), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), secondary fungal or viral infections (especially with prolonged use).
* **Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, discontinue use and consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.

### How it Works

Dexamethasone reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye by suppressing the body's inflammatory response.  This helps alleviate symptoms such as redness, swelling, and discomfort.  Tobramycin, on the other hand, works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, effectively killing the bacteria causing the infection.  The combined action of these two components makes the medication effective in treating the symptoms and the underlying bacterial cause of eye infections.
