# Dexamethasone + Tobramycin

**Generic Name:** Dexamethasone + Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension/Ointment

**Usage:**

Dexamethasone + Tobramycin is an ophthalmic (eye) medication used to treat various inflammatory and bacterial eye infections.  The combination drug is particularly useful for conditions where both inflammation and bacterial infection are present.  Specific uses include:

* **Bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye):**  Especially when accompanied by significant inflammation.
* **Blepharitis:** Inflammation of the eyelids.
* **Corneal ulcers:**  (Often in conjunction with other treatments).
* **Post-operative inflammation:** Following eye surgery.
* **Other inflammatory conditions of the eye:**  As directed by an ophthalmologist.


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, Dexamethasone + Tobramycin can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation:** Upon application.
* **Eye irritation:** Redness, itching.
* **Increased intraocular pressure (IOP):**  This is a serious side effect and requires monitoring, especially in patients with glaucoma or a history of high IOP.
* **Eyelid swelling:**
* **Blurred vision:** Temporary.
* **Headache:**
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling.  (Rare but serious).
* **Secondary infections:** Prolonged use can increase the risk of fungal or viral infections.


**How it Works:**

This combination medication works through two active ingredients:

* **Dexamethasone:** A corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye.  It works by suppressing the immune system's response in the affected area.
* **Tobramycin:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that kills bacteria causing the infection.  It works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial death.

By combining these two active ingredients, the medication addresses both the infection and the inflammation simultaneously, providing faster and more effective relief.
