# Dimethicone (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Dimethicone (Systemic)

### Usage
Dimethicone (systemic), also known as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), is a silicone-based medication primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with excessive gas in the gastrointestinal tract.  These symptoms include bloating, feelings of fullness, and general discomfort caused by gas.  It's specifically targeted at alleviating these symptoms, not at treating the underlying cause of gas production.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For gas retention, the typical adult dose is 50 mg four times a day (QID), as needed.  This is usually taken after meals and at bedtime.

**Children (Infants):**  For gas retention in infants, the dosage is 21 mg with or after each feeding. The maximum daily dose for infants is 126 mg.  Always follow the instructions provided by your pediatrician or on the product packaging.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. This is because dimethicone is not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream.  Always consult a healthcare professional before adjusting the dosage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, although their frequency is not well-defined, may include:

* Change in stool consistency (possibly softer stools)
* Nausea
* Vomiting

While rare, always consult your doctor immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Dimethicone works by reducing the surface tension of mucus in the intestines. This allows trapped gas bubbles to coalesce and easily pass through the gastrointestinal tract, thereby relieving the associated symptoms of bloating and discomfort. It's important to understand that dimethicone does not reduce gas production itself, only the symptoms related to its presence.


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Dimethicone is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity or allergy to dimethicone or any components of the formulation.
* **Fructose Intolerance:** Avoid use in patients with fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of dimethicone during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Other Medications:** Currently, there are no documented significant interactions with other medications. However, inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking to ensure there are no unforeseen issues.
