# Dyphylline
### Generic Name
Dyphylline

### Usage
Dyphylline is primarily used to manage reversible airway obstruction, most commonly associated with asthma and chronic bronchitis.  It's a bronchodilator, meaning it helps relax and widen the airways in the lungs, making breathing easier.  While its main use is for managing these conditions, it is not intended for acute attacks (sudden, severe worsening of symptoms).  It's typically used as part of a broader treatment plan, often in conjunction with other medications.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical oral dose for asthma or reversible bronchospasm is up to 15 mg/kg every 6 hours.  The exact dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response to treatment.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of dyphylline in children have not been established, therefore it is generally not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.  For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 50 mL/min, 75% of the normal dose is administered; for CrCl between 10-50 mL/min, 50% is given; and for CrCl less than 10 mL/min, only 25% of the normal dose is used.  The safety and efficacy in patients with liver impairment haven't been determined.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Restlessness
* Insomnia
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Muscle twitching

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Circulatory failure
* Ventricular arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Albuminuria (protein in the urine)
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
* Seizures


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Dyphylline, like other xanthines, works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP).  Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of the smooth muscles in the airways, resulting in bronchodilation.  Additionally, dyphylline acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, further contributing to its bronchodilating effect.  In essence, it opens up the airways, making it easier to breathe.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dyphylline is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and in those experiencing a status asthmaticus (a severe, life-threatening asthma attack).

* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using dyphylline in patients with severe cardiac disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, acute myocardial injury, or peptic ulcer disease.

* **Drug Interactions:** Dyphylline's toxicity can increase when used concurrently with sympathomimetics.  Its effects are potentiated by probenecid.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Dyphylline is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully known. It is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I use Dyphylline to treat an acute asthma attack?**
A: No, Dyphylline is not for treating acute asthma attacks.  It's for long-term management of reversible airway obstruction.  Use a rescue inhaler for acute symptoms.

**Q: How should I store Dyphylline?**
A: Store as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

**Q: Can I stop taking Dyphylline suddenly?**
A: Do not stop taking Dyphylline without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation may lead to worsening of symptoms.
