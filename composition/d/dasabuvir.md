# Dasabuvir
### Generic Name
Dasabuvir

### Usage

Dasabuvir is an antiviral medication used specifically to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.  It's crucial to understand that dasabuvir is *not* used alone; it's always part of a combination therapy regimen with other antiviral drugs.  This combination approach targets different stages of the HCV lifecycle, significantly increasing the chances of successful treatment and preventing the virus from developing resistance.  The specific combination of drugs used with dasabuvir depends on several factors, including the patient's HCV genotype, the presence of cirrhosis (liver scarring), and previous treatment history.

### Dosage

Dasabuvir dosage is always determined in consultation with a healthcare professional and is highly individualized based on factors like HCV genotype, liver health, and other medications the patient may be taking.  The information below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  **Never adjust your dosage without explicit instruction from your doctor.**

**Adults:** Dasabuvir is typically administered orally as a 250 mg tablet twice daily (BID). The duration of treatment varies from 8 to 24 weeks depending on the specific combination regimen used and patient factors.  Common combination regimens include dasabuvir with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir, and sometimes ribavirin.  The addition of ribavirin is often dependent on factors such as genotype, the presence of cirrhosis, and treatment experience.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of dasabuvir in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with certain conditions.  Individuals with mild hepatic impairment (liver damage) may not require dosage adjustments, but those with moderate to severe hepatic impairment should generally avoid using dasabuvir. Renal impairment does not typically necessitate dosage changes.  Your doctor will carefully assess your individual circumstances to determine the appropriate dosage.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Itching (pruritus)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Weakness (asthenia)

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) can include:

* Vomiting
* Anemia
* Elevated bilirubin levels
* Elevated ALT (liver enzyme) levels

Serious but rare side effects (less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports) can include:

* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Depression
* Dehydration
* Liver failure (hepatic failure)
* Liver decompensation
* Suicidal ideation

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, promptly contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Dasabuvir inhibits the activity of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase. This enzyme is essential for HCV replicationâ€”the process by which the virus makes copies of itself.  By blocking NS5B polymerase, dasabuvir effectively prevents the virus from multiplying, allowing the body's immune system to clear the infection.  It's important to remember that dasabuvir works most effectively in combination with other antiviral agents that target different parts of the HCV lifecycle.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dasabuvir is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and concomitant use with specific medications (such as certain birth control pills, strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, and strong enzyme inducers).

* **Interactions:** Dasabuvir can interact with other medications.  Inhibitors of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 enzymes can increase dasabuvir blood levels, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dasabuvir is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially when combined with ribavirin. The safety of dasabuvir during breastfeeding is unknown.

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Individuals with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment should not use dasabuvir. Close monitoring of liver function is crucial for patients with any degree of hepatic impairment.

* **Other Precautions:** Patients with diabetes should be closely monitored for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) since successful HCV treatment can sometimes improve glucose metabolism.  Patients should also be monitored for signs of mood changes, depression, or suicidal ideation.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dasabuvir on its own?** A: No, dasabuvir must be used as part of a combination therapy regimen for HCV.  It's ineffective as monotherapy.

* **Q: How should I store dasabuvir?** A:  Store dasabuvir according to the instructions on the medication label. Typically this involves storing it at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's more than 6 hours until your next dose. In that case, skip the missed dose and continue your regular schedule.

* **Q:  Is dasabuvir safe for long-term use?** A:  The long-term effects of dasabuvir are not yet fully known.  Treatment duration is usually for a defined period (8-24 weeks), determined by your doctor based on your condition and treatment response.

* **Q: Are there specific dietary restrictions I should follow while taking dasabuvir?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions. Generally, it's recommended to take dasabuvir with food.
