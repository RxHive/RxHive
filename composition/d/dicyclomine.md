# Dicyclomine
### Generic Name
Dicyclomine

### Usage
Dicyclomine is an anticholinergic medication primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional bowel disorders.  Its main action is to reduce the spasms and cramping in the intestines that cause abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.  While primarily used for gastrointestinal issues, it may also be used off-label to treat other conditions involving muscle spasms, such as certain types of bladder spasms or, rarely, to reduce excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis). However, its use in these conditions is less common and should be under strict medical supervision.  It's crucial to understand that dicyclomine treats the *symptoms* of these conditions, not the underlying cause.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of their symptoms.  A healthcare professional should always determine the appropriate dosage.  Generally:

* **Adults (Oral):**  The typical starting dose is 20 mg three or four times daily.  The maximum daily dose is usually not to exceed 120 mg.
* **Children (Oral):** Dicyclomine dosage for children is determined by the doctor based on weight and age.  It's rarely used in children under 6 years old.  The dosage is generally much lower than for adults.
* **IV Administration:** Dicyclomine is not typically administered intravenously.  Intramuscular (IM) injection is very rarely used and should only be performed by a medical professional in specific circumstances.

**Different Forms:** Dicyclomine is available in oral forms, such as capsules and tablets.  Syrup formulations are also available, particularly for children.  Always follow the instructions on the prescription label.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of dicyclomine can include:

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Difficulty urinating
* Increased heart rate
* Confusion (especially in older adults)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
* Glaucoma
* High fever
* Difficulty swallowing
* Severe constipation


If you experience any serious or persistent side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Dicyclomine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal tract. By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, dicyclomine helps to relax the intestinal muscles, thus reducing spasms and cramping. This leads to relief from abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of dicyclomine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor, as its safety in these situations hasn't been fully established.
* **Glaucoma:** Individuals with glaucoma or a history of glaucoma should avoid dicyclomine, as it can worsen the condition.
* **Prostate Problems:** Men with enlarged prostates may find urination more difficult while taking dicyclomine.
* **Other Medications:**  Dicyclomine can interact with other medications, particularly those affecting the central nervous system or affecting heart rate.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults are more susceptible to the side effects of dicyclomine, especially confusion and drowsiness.  Lower doses might be necessary.
* **Heat Exposure:**  Dicyclomine can reduce sweating, increasing the risk of heatstroke. Avoid excessive heat exposure.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for dicyclomine to work?**  A:  The onset of action varies, but relief from symptoms is often seen within 30-60 minutes of taking a dose.  However, it may take several days of consistent use to see the full therapeutic effect.

* **Q: Can I stop taking dicyclomine suddenly?** A:  It's best not to stop taking dicyclomine suddenly, especially if you've been taking it for a while.  Discuss any plans to discontinue the medication with your doctor to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms or worsening of your condition.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking dicyclomine?**  A: Alcohol can worsen drowsiness and dizziness caused by dicyclomine. It's advisable to avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication.

* **Q: How should I store dicyclomine?** A: Store dicyclomine in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture, as per the instructions on the label.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
