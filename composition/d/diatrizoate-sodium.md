# Diatrizoate Sodium
### Generic Name
Diatrizoate Sodium

### Usage
Diatrizoate sodium is an iodinated contrast medium primarily used to enhance images during computed tomography (CT) scans of the gastrointestinal tract.  It's employed when barium sulfate, another common contrast agent, is unsuitable.  The improved visualization allows for better diagnosis of various gastrointestinal conditions.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For contrast enhancement in CT scans of the gastrointestinal tract, the typical oral dose is 3.7 grams (diluted in 200 mL of solution). This is administered in three doses: 1.5 hours, 1 hour, and 0.5 hours before the examination.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of diatrizoate sodium in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not typically used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects
* **Common:** Diarrhea
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypovolemia (low blood volume),  pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs),  anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), other allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe).

It is crucial to report any adverse effects to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Diatrizoate sodium is an iodinated compound that is opaque to X-rays. When administered, it increases the density of the tissues and organs it flows through, allowing these structures to be more clearly visualized on a CT scan. This enhanced contrast helps radiologists better identify abnormalities or diseases within the gastrointestinal tract.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Diatrizoate sodium is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction) to diatrizoate sodium, iodine, other iodine-containing contrast agents, or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Use with Caution:**  Increased risk of dehydration and pulmonary edema exists. Use with caution in patients with a history of mild to moderate reactions to contrast dye or iodine, asthma, debilitation, hyperthyroidism, risk of aspiration, or electrolyte disturbances.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Diatrizoate sodium is categorized as pregnancy category C.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.  Consult a healthcare professional to weigh the risks and benefits.
