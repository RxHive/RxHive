# Dimethicone (topical)
### Generic Name
Dimethicone (topical)

### Usage
Dimethicone, also known as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), is a silicone-based oil used topically for several purposes.  Its primary use is in the treatment of head lice infestations.  The dimethicone suffocates the lice, leading to their death.  It is also used as a skin protectant. In this capacity, it forms a barrier on the skin, reducing exposure to irritants such as harsh chemicals, detergents, and moisture. This protective function is helpful in preventing conditions like diaper rash and bedsores, and it can also soothe dry, chapped skin.

### Dosage
**Head Lice:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥6 months:** For head lice treatment, a 4% dimethicone lotion is applied liberally to completely cover all hair.  The lotion should remain in place for at least 8 hours before being washed out with regular shampoo and thoroughly rinsed with water.  A second application is typically recommended after 7 days.

**Skin Protectant:**

* **Adults and Children:**  For use as a skin protectant, a 10% dimethicone cream is applied to the affected area as needed.  The exact amount will depend on the size of the affected area.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Skin irritation
* Itching at the application site
* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Seborrheic dermatitis (scalp inflammation)
* Pruritus (itching)

Less common, but more serious, side effects include hypersensitivity reactions and dyspnea (shortness of breath).  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
In treating head lice, dimethicone works by physically coating the lice, preventing them from breathing and regulating their water balance. This leads to their asphyxiation and death.  As a skin protectant, dimethicone creates a thin, protective film over the skin. This barrier prevents the penetration of irritants and helps retain moisture, protecting the skin from dryness and further irritation.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Dimethicone should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to dimethicone or any of its components.
* **Hypersensitivity:** There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.  Discontinue use and seek medical attention if a reaction occurs.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of dimethicone during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established.  Consult a healthcare provider before use.
* **Eye Contact:** Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, flush immediately with water.
* **Flammable:** Dimethicone topical lotion is flammable; keep away from open flames or ignition sources.
* **Damaged Skin:** Do not apply to inflamed or broken skin.
