# Daclatasvir + Sofosbuvir

**Generic Name:** Daclatasvir/Sofosbuvir

**Usage:** Daclatasvir/Sofosbuvir is a combination medication used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults.  The specific genotype(s) of HCV it treats varies depending on the formulation and accompanying medications (if any), but it's often used for genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Treatment duration varies depending on the genotype and other factors, and is determined by a physician.  It may be used alone or in combination with other antiviral medications.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or eruption.

Less common but more serious side effects can occur. These include:

* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes (this should be monitored regularly).
* **Heart problems:** Irregular heartbeat.
* **Severe allergic reactions:** These are rare but can be life-threatening.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or hives.
* **Psychiatric effects:** Depression or mood changes.

**This list is not exhaustive.** Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and to report any concerns.


**How it Works:**  Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir are both direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs).  They work by targeting different stages of the HCV life cycle:

* **Daclatasvir:**  Inhibits the NS5A protein, which is essential for HCV replication and assembly.
* **Sofosbuvir:** Inhibits the NS5B polymerase, an enzyme that is crucial for HCV replication.

By inhibiting these essential proteins, the combination prevents the virus from multiplying and eventually clears the virus from the body.
