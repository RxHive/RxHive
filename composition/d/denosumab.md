# Denosumab
### Generic Name
Denosumab

### Usage

Denosumab is a medication primarily used to treat osteoporosis, a condition characterized by weakened bones and increased fracture risk.  Its main application is in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture.  However, its use extends to other groups at elevated fracture risk, including men with osteoporosis, men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, women receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer, and individuals with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.

Beyond osteoporosis, denosumab has significant applications in oncology. It's used to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events (like bone fractures and spinal cord compression) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors or multiple myeloma.  It also plays a role in treating giant cell tumors of the bone that are difficult or risky to surgically remove, and in managing hypercalcemia of malignancy that hasn't responded to bisphosphonate treatment.

### Dosage

Denosumab dosage varies considerably depending on the specific condition being treated.  It is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).

* **Osteoporosis (men and postmenopausal women, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, androgen deprivation therapy-induced bone loss, aromatase inhibitor-induced bone loss):**  A single 60 mg dose every six months.  Prior treatment for secondary causes of osteoporosis is often recommended.

* **Bone metastases from solid tumors or multiple myeloma (prevention of skeletal-related events):** 120 mg every four weeks.

* **Giant cell tumor of bone or hypercalcemia of malignancy:** 120 mg once every four weeks, with additional 120 mg doses on days 8 and 15 of the first month.

* **Pediatric use (giant cell tumor of bone in skeletally mature adolescents ≥45 kg):** 120 mg every four weeks, with additional 120 mg doses on days 8 and 15 of the first month.


Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for hepatic impairment.  For renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), close monitoring for hypocalcemia is recommended.  The drug is unlikely to be removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis; however, caution and close monitoring of calcium levels are necessary in dialysis patients.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (>10%) include fatigue, headache, peripheral edema, hypertension, diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, constipation, skin rash, dermatitis, eczema, hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, back pain, arthralgia, limb pain, dyspnea, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection.

Less common but serious side effects (1-10% or less) include serious infections, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical fractures (subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures), hypercalcemia,  hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and severe hypocalcemia.  Rare but potentially serious side effects reported post-marketing include anaphylaxis and pancreatitis.


If you experience any concerning side effects, promptly consult your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits RANK ligand (RANKL).  RANKL is a protein crucial for the formation and activity of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue. By blocking RANKL, denosumab reduces bone resorption, leading to increased bone density and strength in osteoporosis.  In cancer patients with bone metastases, this inhibition of osteoclast activity reduces bone destruction and associated skeletal-related events. In giant cell tumors of bone, it inhibits tumor growth by interfering with RANKL’s interaction with its receptor on osteoclasts and tumor cells.

### Precautions

Denosumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication, pre-existing hypocalcemia, and pregnancy (Category X).  It should be used with caution in patients with impaired immune systems, those taking immunosuppressants, patients with renal impairment, and those at risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., individuals with hypoparathyroidism or those undergoing thyroid or parathyroid surgery).  Adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation is typically recommended during treatment.


Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and for at least five months after treatment.  The drug’s effects on breastfeeding are unknown, therefore caution is advised.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Denosumab to work?** A: The effects on bone density may not be fully apparent for several months, although some improvements might be seen sooner.  The full benefit might take longer to show up.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, then continue with the regular six-monthly dosing schedule.


* **Q: Can I stop taking Denosumab suddenly?** A:  No.  Stopping Denosumab abruptly can lead to a rapid loss of bone mineral density. Consult your doctor before stopping treatment; usually a transition to alternative therapy is recommended.


* **Q: Does Denosumab affect tooth health?** A:  There's a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) associated with Denosumab, particularly in patients with certain risk factors such as poor oral hygiene or dental procedures.  Regular dental checkups are recommended.


* **Q: How should I store Denosumab?** A: Store it in the refrigerator, as instructed on the product label.


* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: Yes,  Denosumab may interact with certain medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're taking.
