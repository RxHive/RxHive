# Dostarlimab
### Generic Name
Dostarlimab

### Usage
Dostarlimab is a type of immunotherapy medication, specifically a programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating adult patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer that has progressed after prior treatment with a platinum-containing regimen.  This means the cancer cells have a specific genetic defect (dMMR) and haven't responded to previous chemotherapy.  Dostarlimab is also being investigated for use in other dMMR solid tumors, though its approval is currently limited to endometrial cancer.  The use in other cancers is still under research and clinical trials.


### Dosage
Dostarlimab is administered intravenously (IV).  The typical dosage regimen for adult patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer is as follows:

* **Phase 1:** 500 mg every 3 weeks for 4 doses.
* **Phase 2:** 1000 mg every 6 weeks, beginning 3 weeks after the fourth dose, and continuing until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function, and the occurrence of side effects.  This will be determined and managed by the prescribing physician.  The dosage and administration for children haven't been established, meaning it's not currently recommended for use in pediatric patients.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash
* Changes in blood levels of various substances (e.g., albumin, magnesium, potassium, sodium, calcium)
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Urinary tract infection
* Anemia
* Decreased white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes)
* Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP)
* Weakness (asthenia)
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Elevated creatinine levels
* Cough
* Fever

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Immune-related adverse reactions affecting various organs (e.g., colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, endocrinopathies).  These are crucial to monitor closely.
* Infusion reactions (allergic reactions during infusion)
* Dermatologic reactions, including severe ones such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.


**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Dostarlimab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 protein found on the surface of certain immune cells (T cells).  Cancer cells often use the PD-1 pathway to evade detection and destruction by the immune system.  By blocking PD-1, Dostarlimab helps to release the brakes on the immune system, allowing T cells to recognize and attack the cancer cells more effectively.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  There are currently no specific contraindications listed by the manufacturer, but this does not mean that the drug is suitable for all individuals. Always discuss your health history and any pre-existing conditions with your doctor before starting this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dostarlimab may interact with certain other medications, such as corticosteroids, antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Dostarlimab can potentially harm a developing fetus, so it's crucial to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding isn't recommended during treatment and for 4 months afterward.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems.
