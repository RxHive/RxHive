# Difelikefalin
### Generic Name
Difelikefalin

### Usage
Difelikefalin is a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe itching (pruritus) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults who are undergoing hemodialysis (HD).  It's specifically indicated for CKD-associated pruritus, and its use is limited to this patient population undergoing HD.  Currently, there's no approved use for this medication in individuals on peritoneal dialysis or for other types of itching.

### Dosage

**Adults (undergoing hemodialysis):** The typical dose is 0.5 mcg/kg administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection into the venous line of the dialysis circuit. This injection should be given at the end of each hemodialysis treatment.  The medication is removed by the dialyzer membrane and must be administered *after* blood is no longer circulating through the dialyzer.  Do not mix or dilute Difelikefalin before administration.  The manufacturer provides a formula to calculate the total injection volume based on the patient's target dry body weight:  Total injection volume (mL) = Patient target dry body weight (kg) x 0.01, rounded to the nearest tenth (0.1 mL).  If a hemodialysis treatment is missed, resume Difelikefalin at the end of the next treatment. The dose must be administered within 60 minutes of syringe preparation; discard any unused portion.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of difelikefalin in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.  However, difelikefalin pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and its use is not recommended in this population.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) include:

*   Nervous system effects: Abnormal gait (including falls), altered mental status (confusion), dizziness, drowsiness, headache.
*   Gastrointestinal effects: Diarrhea, nausea.
*   Endocrine and metabolic effects: Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood).

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may occur.  It is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects develop.

### How it Works

Difelikefalin is a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist.  This means it binds to and activates KORs. While the exact way this relieves itching in CKD patients isn't fully understood, it's thought that this interaction plays a role in reducing the sensation of itch.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of dizziness, somnolence (sleepiness), mental status changes, and gait disturbances.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Use caution when administering difelikefalin with centrally acting depressants (e.g., sedatives, certain pain relievers), sedating antihistamines, and opioid analgesics. Concomitant use may increase the risk of central nervous system (CNS) side effects.
* **Special Populations:**  Use in pregnant women is not thoroughly studied, and the risk to the fetus is unknown. Itâ€™s also unknown whether difelikefalin is excreted in breast milk. Healthcare providers should carefully weigh the benefits and risks for both mother and child before prescribing this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take difelikefalin if I'm not on hemodialysis?** A: No, difelikefalin is only approved for use in adults with CKD-associated pruritus undergoing hemodialysis.

* **Q: How should I store difelikefalin?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label.  Generally, medications should be stored according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a regularly scheduled hemodialysis treatment and difelikefalin dose, resume the medication at the end of your next hemodialysis session.

* **Q: Can I operate machinery after taking difelikefalin?** A:  Difelikefalin may impair mental or physical abilities. Avoid operating machinery or driving until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking difelikefalin?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for personalized advice regarding dietary considerations.  Monitoring potassium levels may be necessary due to the potential risk of hyperkalemia.
