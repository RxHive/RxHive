# D-Mannose
### Generic Name
D-Mannose

### Usage
D-mannose is a simple sugar naturally found in various fruits and vegetables like cranberries, apples, and oranges.  While it's marketed as a potential treatment and preventative measure for urinary tract infections (UTIs),  scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited and requires further research.  Currently, D-mannose's use is primarily as a dietary supplement, not as a clinically proven medication for UTIs.

### Dosage
Established clinical dosages for D-mannose to treat specific conditions haven't been determined.  The amount used as a supplement varies greatly depending on the product and individual recommendations, and it is important to always follow product instructions and seek medical advice before use.  No specific dosage recommendations exist for children.


### Side Effects
While generally considered safe in small amounts due to its natural occurrence in foods, higher doses of D-mannose supplements may cause:

* Bloating
* Loose stools
* Diarrhea


Serious side effects are uncommon, but it's vital to contact a healthcare provider if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works
The proposed mechanism of action for D-mannose in UTIs is its ability to prevent *Escherichia coli* (E. coli) bacteria—a common cause of UTIs—from adhering to the lining of the urinary tract.  Essentially, it's thought to interfere with the bacteria's ability to stick to the bladder wall, allowing them to be flushed out with urine.  However, this mechanism is not fully understood and requires further investigation.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Avoid D-mannose supplementation during pregnancy and breastfeeding as the safety and efficacy in these populations are not established.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Currently, there is no known clinically significant interaction between D-mannose and other medications. However, it is always best to discuss any supplements you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist, especially if you are on other medications.
* **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Individuals with pre-existing health issues should consult a doctor before using D-mannose supplements.
* **Long-Term Safety:** The long-term safety and toxicity of high doses of D-mannose are not fully known.
* **Do not delay standard UTI care:**  If you suspect you have a UTI, seek medical attention promptly. Do not rely solely on D-mannose as a treatment, as delaying appropriate medical care can lead to serious complications.
