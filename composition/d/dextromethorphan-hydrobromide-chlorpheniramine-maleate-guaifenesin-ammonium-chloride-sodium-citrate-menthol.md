# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

This combination is not a single, officially named generic drug.  It's a combination of several active ingredients commonly found in over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medications.  Therefore, there is no single "generic name" for this entire combination.  Each ingredient has its own generic name.

**Usage:**  This combination is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan (an antitussive) suppresses coughs. Guaifenesin (an expectorant) helps loosen and thin mucus.
* **Runny nose and sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine (an antihistamine) helps relieve these symptoms.
* **Congestion:** Ammonium chloride and Sodium Citrate may help to thin mucus (though evidence for their effectiveness is debated), although their main role is to help maintain acidic pH balance in the formulation and may contribute to a potential expectorant effect.
* **Sore throat:** Menthol provides a cooling sensation which may offer temporary relief.

**Important Note:** This combination should be used only as directed on the product label.  It's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist before using this combination, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.


**Side Effects:** The side effects of this combination are primarily those associated with the individual ingredients and can vary depending on the dose and individual sensitivity.  Possible side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:**  A common side effect of both dextromethorphan and chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of chlorpheniramine.
* **Nausea:**  Possible side effect of several ingredients.
* **Headache:** A possible side effect of several ingredients.
* **Dizziness:** Possible side effect of several ingredients.
* **Constipation:** Possible side effect of several ingredients.
* **Stomach upset:** Possible side effect, particularly with ammonium chloride.
* **Allergic reactions:** Possible with any ingredient.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or other signs of a serious allergic reaction.

**How it Works:**

* **Dextromethorphan:** Works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing runny nose and sneezing.
* **Guaifenesin:** Thins and loosens mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Ammonium Chloride and Sodium Citrate:**  These work together to help maintain an acidic pH which can contribute to expectorant activity (though evidence of this is limited compared to other expectorants).  Their main function in this mixture is likely to aid formulation stability.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation that may temporarily relieve throat discomfort.
