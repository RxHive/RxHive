# Diphenidol
### Generic Name
Diphenidol

### Usage
Diphenidol is primarily used to treat vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.  It's particularly helpful in managing the unpleasant symptoms associated with inner ear problems that cause dizziness and nausea. While its primary use focuses on these vestibular symptoms, it can also be employed to control nausea and vomiting in other contexts, although this is less common.  It's important to note that due to potential side effects, its use should be under close medical supervision, usually in a hospital or similar setting.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  For vertigo, nausea, or vomiting, the oral dosage is 25-50 mg every 4 hours as needed. The maximum daily dose is 300 mg.  **Crucially**, because of the risk of hallucinations, confusion, or disorientation, Diphenidol should only be used in patients under close, continuous medical supervision, typically in a hospital setting.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For children weighing 22.8-45.6 kg (50-100 lbs), the oral dose is 25 mg every 4 hours as needed.  Diphenidol is generally not recommended for children under 22.8 kg (50 lbs).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment. Diphenidol is not recommended for use in patients with renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Indigestion
* Heartburn
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Blurred vision

Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* Hallucinations
* Confusion
* Disorientation
* Overstimulation
* Depression
* Sleep disturbances
* Transient, slight decreases in blood pressure

If any adverse effects occur, it's essential to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Diphenidol reduces stimulation of the vestibular system (inner ear system responsible for balance) and dampens the function of the labyrinth (the inner ear structure involved in balance and hearing).  It also possesses antimuscarinic properties (blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter).  These actions contribute to its ability to reduce nausea and vomiting.  Its antiemetic effect might also involve the suppression of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone, a brain region that plays a critical role in initiating vomiting.


### Precautions
Diphenidol is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to Diphenidol or its components, and in patients with anuria (absence of urine production).

Increased risk of hallucinations, confusion, and disorientation exists, especially in the elderly.  Use with caution in patients with a history of kidney disease, ulcers, gastric disorders, or glaucoma, and in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  The safety and efficacy in pregnant or breastfeeding women have not been established.
