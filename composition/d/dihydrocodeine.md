# Dihydrocodeine
### Generic Name
Dihydrocodeine

### Usage
Dihydrocodeine is primarily used to relieve moderate to severe pain and as an antitussive (cough suppressant) for non-productive coughs.  Its analgesic effects stem from its action on opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), while its antitussive properties result from its direct action on the cough center in the medulla. Although primarily used for pain and cough, the precise indication will depend on the formulation and dosage.  Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following information is for general knowledge and should not replace the advice of a healthcare professional. Dosage should be determined and adjusted by a doctor based on individual needs and response.

**Adults:**

* **Cough:** Oral solution (9.5 mg/5 mL): 5–10 mL every 4–6 hours; Elixir (10 mg/5 mL): 10 mg every 4–6 hours.
* **Moderate to Severe Pain:** Elixir (10 mg/5 mL): 10–30 mg every 4–6 hours; Immediate-release tablet (30 mg): 30 mg every 4–6 hours.
* **Severe Pain:** Immediate-release tablet (40 mg): 40–80 mg three times daily (maximum 240 mg/day); Prolonged-release tablet: 60–120 mg every 12 hours.  Intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection: 50 mg every 4–6 hours.


**Children:**  Use in children under 12 years of age is not recommended in many countries for pain and cough, except under specific circumstances and with careful physician monitoring.  Dosage for children, when prescribed, is significantly lower than adult doses and is strictly weight-based, often calculated as milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg).  Always follow your physician's instructions carefully. Adolescent dosing may approach adult levels.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are usually provided for renal impairment in manufacturer labeling, however, caution is advised with reduced doses.  For hepatic (liver) impairment, the use of elixirs and immediate-release tablets is contraindicated in severe cases, and caution is advised with reduced doses in less severe cases.


### Side Effects

* Dependence/withdrawal symptoms (with long-term use)
* Seizures (especially in infants and children)
* Liver enzyme abnormalities
* Urinary retention

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Dihydrocodeine is an opioid analgesic that works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. This action reduces the perception of pain signals and alters the body's response to pain.  It also acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress coughs.  The exact mechanism of action is complex and involves multiple pathways in the nervous system.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dihydrocodeine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components, respiratory depression, and acute asthma attacks.  Specific contraindications vary depending on the formulation (e.g., elixir, tablet, injection).  Consult the product labeling for detailed information.

* **Drug Interactions:** Dihydrocodeine can interact with many medications, including other CNS depressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, sedatives, tranquilizers, certain antidepressants, and MAO inhibitors.  These interactions can increase the risk of drowsiness, respiratory depression, and other adverse effects. Inform your physician of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dihydrocodeine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully established. It is generally avoided in pregnancy unless absolutely necessary and appropriate monitoring is in place.  Dihydrocodeine can pass into breast milk and may cause respiratory depression in nursing infants.  It's usually recommended to avoid use during breastfeeding.

* **Geriatric and Pediatric Populations:** Older adults and children are more sensitive to the effects of Dihydrocodeine and require careful monitoring.  Specific precautions and dosage adjustments are crucial in these populations.

* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in individuals with conditions such as liver or kidney disease, head injury, low blood pressure, adrenal insufficiency, bowel disorders, and prostatic hyperplasia.  Avoid activities requiring alertness (e.g., driving) until you know how Dihydrocodeine affects you.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Dihydrocodeine to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the formulation and route of administration.  Effects typically begin within 30 minutes to an hour for oral forms.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Dihydrocodeine?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the risk of CNS depression and other adverse effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Dihydrocodeine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can Dihydrocodeine be habit-forming?** A: Yes, Dihydrocodeine is an opioid and can be habit-forming with prolonged use.  It is crucial to only use it as prescribed by your doctor and to follow their instructions regarding discontinuation.  Abrupt cessation after prolonged use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: What are the withdrawal symptoms?** A:  Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, insomnia and more. The severity depends on the duration and dose of Dihydrocodeine used.
