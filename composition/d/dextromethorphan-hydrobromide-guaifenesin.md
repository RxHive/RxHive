# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin
### Generic Name
Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin

### Usage

This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold or the flu.  Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is a cough suppressant (an antitussive) that works by reducing the urge to cough. Guaifenesin is an expectorant; it helps loosen congestion in your chest and throat by thinning the mucus, making it easier to cough up.  This drug is effective for coughs with mucus (productive coughs) as well as dry coughs.  It's important to note that this medication treats symptoms, not the underlying cause of the illness.  It's not typically used for coughs caused by smoking or emphysema.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, liquid), age, and weight of the patient.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.**  Never exceed the recommended dose.  Information below is for general guidance only and should not substitute advice from a healthcare professional.


* **Adults and children 12 years and older:**  Dosage will typically be found on the product label and will often involve taking a specific dose every 4-6 hours as needed, but not exceeding the maximum daily dose.

* **Children under 12 years old:**  Use in children under 12 years old should only be done under the direction of a physician as there are formulations specifically designed for this age group.  Dosage is dependent on weight and age and will be specified by the doctor.


**Oral Administration:**  Most formulations are taken orally, usually with a glass of water.  Follow any specific instructions provided with your medication.  Liquid formulations should be measured accurately using a medication measuring spoon or syringe, not a regular kitchen spoon.

**IV Administration:**  This combination is not typically administered intravenously.  Dextromethorphan and guaifenesin are primarily oral medications.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Constipation
* Upset stomach


Less common, but more serious side effects, may require immediate medical attention.  These can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)

* Hallucinations (especially at high doses or with misuse)


**If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Dextromethorphan works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It does this by affecting certain nerve signals that trigger the urge to cough. Guaifenesin works in the respiratory tract. It thins the mucus, making it easier to expectorate (cough up) the phlegm, thus relieving chest congestion.
