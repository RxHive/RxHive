# Doxepin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Doxepin (Systemic)

### Usage
Doxepin is primarily used as an antidepressant to treat major depressive disorder.  It's also prescribed off-label for the treatment of anxiety and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.  A notable secondary use is in managing insomnia, specifically difficulties maintaining sleep.  It's important to note that Doxepin is not approved for use in children.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated.

* **Depression, Anxiety, Alcoholism:** Oral administration (capsules or concentrate).  The initial dose is typically 75 mg/day, either in a single dose or divided throughout the day.  The usual range is 75-150 mg/day, with a maximum of 300 mg/day in divided doses.  In patients with very mild symptoms related to organic disease, a lower dose of 25-50 mg/day might suffice.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradual dose increases and tapering.

* **Insomnia (Sleep Maintenance):** Oral administration.  The recommended starting dose is 6 mg once daily, 30 minutes before bedtime. Some patients may respond to a lower dose of 3 mg.  For patients over 65, the initial dose is 3 mg, potentially increased to 6 mg as needed. The maximum daily dose for insomnia is 6 mg.  Capsule formulations (off-label) might use a 10mg once-daily dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Doxepin in children have not been established.  It is not approved for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are given in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with these conditions.  A 14-day gap is recommended between stopping a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and starting Doxepin, and vice versa.

### How it Works

Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. These neurotransmitters play a crucial role in mood regulation and sleep.  By blocking their reuptake, Doxepin enhances their effects, helping alleviate depression and improve sleep. Additionally, it blocks histamine receptors (H1), which contributes to its sedative effects and aids in sleep maintenance.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Doxepin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Doxepin or any component of the formulation; narrow-angle glaucoma; urinary retention; those currently taking or who have recently stopped taking MAOIs; those in the acute recovery phase after a heart attack; those with acute congestive heart failure; those with a history of blood disorders; severe liver disease.

* **Drug Interactions:** Doxepin can interact with numerous medications, including MAOIs, other antidepressants, antihistamines, and certain heart medications.  Itâ€™s crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.

* **Specific Warnings:**  Use caution in elderly patients, those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver or kidney problems, respiratory issues, sleep apnea, or a history of seizures.  The risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior is increased with antidepressant use, particularly in young adults. Close monitoring is necessary. Doxepin should be used with extreme caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Doxepin?** A: No, alcohol can increase the sedative effects of Doxepin and worsen side effects. Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Doxepin suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Doxepin can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your dosage.

* **Q: How should I store Doxepin?** A: Store Doxepin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is Doxepin habit-forming?** A: Doxepin is not typically considered habit-forming in the same way as opioids. However, it can lead to physical dependence if abruptly discontinued after long-term use.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose.
