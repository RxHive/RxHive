# Domperidone + Cinnarizine
### Generic Name
Domperidone + Cinnarizine

### Usage

Domperidone + Cinnarizine is a combination medication used primarily to treat symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders and vertigo (dizziness).  Domperidone is a prokinetic agent; it helps to speed up the movement of food through the stomach and intestines. This is beneficial for conditions like nausea, vomiting, and bloating caused by various factors including slow gastric emptying.  Cinnarizine is an antihistamine with antiemetic and antivertigo properties.  It helps reduce nausea and vomiting and also helps manage the symptoms of vertigo by reducing the effects of histamine and calcium on the inner ear.

The combination of these two drugs is particularly effective in managing symptoms related to:

* **Nausea and Vomiting:**  Especially in conditions where both gastric motility issues and vestibular dysfunction (inner ear problems) contribute to these symptoms.
* **Vertigo and Dizziness:**  The cinnarizine component is particularly helpful in reducing the feelings of dizziness and unsteadiness.
* **Gastroparesis:** A condition where the stomach empties too slowly, leading to nausea, vomiting, and bloating.  Domperidone helps alleviate this.
* **Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV):** Although other medications are often preferred for this, the combination may be considered in some cases.


It's crucial to understand that this combination medication *treats the symptoms* and doesn't address the underlying cause of the condition.  If you are experiencing persistent nausea, vomiting, or vertigo, it's essential to consult a doctor to determine the root cause and appropriate treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage of Domperidone + Cinnarizine combinations varies depending on the specific formulation, the manufacturer, and the patient's condition.  It's **absolutely crucial to follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist**.  Self-adjusting the dosage can be harmful.  The following is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

**Typical Adult Dosage (Oral):** The dosage typically involves taking one or two tablets (or the equivalent in liquid form) several times a day, often before meals. The precise frequency and number of tablets per dose will be specified by your physician.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The use of Domperidone + Cinnarizine in children is generally not recommended without the express guidance of a pediatrician.  The medication should only be administered to children under strict medical supervision.

**IV Administration:** Domperidone + Cinnarizine combinations are generally not available in forms suitable for intravenous administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Restlessness
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (rare, but more likely with higher doses of domperidone, and may include muscle spasms or tremors)

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Changes in heart rhythm (rare but potentially serious, especially with prolonged high doses of domperidone)
* Prolonged QT interval (requires ECG monitoring in some cases)

**If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Domperidone works by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. This helps reduce nausea and vomiting and enhances gastric motility (the movement of food through the digestive system).  Cinnarizine blocks calcium channels and histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine on the vestibular system (inner ear), thereby alleviating vertigo and dizziness.  It also has antiemetic properties, adding to the overall effect of the combination.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and should only be undertaken under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Patients with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments.
* **Cardiac Conditions:**  Domperidone can prolong the QT interval, potentially increasing the risk of arrhythmias.  Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions or those taking other medications that affect the QT interval should use caution.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination may interact with other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  The medication may cause drowsiness or dizziness. Avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and require lower doses.
