# Domperidone + Cinnarizine

**Generic Name:** Domperidone + Cinnarizine

**Usage:** This combination medication is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders and vertigo (dizziness).  Specifically, it's often prescribed for:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** Domperidone helps to alleviate nausea and vomiting by increasing the motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
* **Vertigo and dizziness:** Cinnarizine acts as an antihistamine and calcium channel blocker, helping to reduce the symptoms of vertigo and dizziness, often associated with inner ear problems or Meniere's disease.
* **Gastroparesis:**  This combination may be used in some cases of gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying).

**It's crucial to note:** This combination isn't a cure for the underlying condition causing nausea, vomiting, or vertigo. It only manages the symptoms.  Always consult a doctor to determine the root cause of your symptoms and the appropriate treatment.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual, dosage, and the presence of other medications.  Common side effects may include:

* **Domperidone related:**  Galactorrhea (breast milk production in non-lactating individuals), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males), restlessness, extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements, especially in high doses), headache, drowsiness.  Rare but serious side effects include prolonged QT interval (can lead to abnormal heart rhythms).
* **Cinnarizine related:** Drowsiness, sedation, dizziness, dry mouth, weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms (though less common than with domperidone).

**Serious side effects require immediate medical attention.** These can include:  severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), irregular heartbeat, signs of liver damage.


**How it Works:**

* **Domperidone:** This is a dopamine antagonist that primarily acts on the receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. By blocking dopamine, it reduces nausea and vomiting and increases gastrointestinal motility (movement).  It doesn't significantly cross the blood-brain barrier, minimizing central nervous system side effects compared to other antiemetics.

* **Cinnarizine:** This is a calcium channel blocker and antihistamine.  It reduces the effects of histamine, which can contribute to vertigo and dizziness. It also affects calcium channels in the inner ear, potentially reducing the symptoms of vertigo.
