# Dexbrompheniramine + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name
Dexbrompheniramine + Phenylephrine

### Usage
This combination medication is used for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies.  It targets two common symptom groups:  runny nose/sneezing (allergic symptoms) and nasal congestion.  Dexbrompheniramine, an antihistamine, helps reduce sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. Phenylephrine, a decongestant, shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.  This medication is intended for short-term symptom relief and is not a cure for these conditions.

### Dosage
**Adults (12 years and older):** Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation available.  Always follow the instructions on your prescription or the product label.  Commonly, this involves taking one or two tablets or a specific measured amount of liquid (syrup) every 4-6 hours, not exceeding the maximum daily dose specified on the packaging.  Never exceed the recommended dose.

**Children (6-11 years):** Dosage for children is lower than for adults and is strictly weight and age dependent.  Always consult the product's packaging for the correct dosage based on the child's age and weight.  Never give this medication to children under 6 years of age unless explicitly directed by a doctor.  

**Children under 6 years:**  This medication is generally not recommended for use in children under 6 years of age without a doctor's prescription and specific instructions.

**Important:** The medication comes in various forms (tablets, syrup). Always follow the administration instructions given on the product label or prescription.  If unsure, consult a pharmacist or healthcare provider.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Headache
* Nausea
* Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
* Nervousness (especially in children)
* Increased heart rate

Less common but serious side effects might include allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.

### How it Works
Dexbrompheniramine blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from causing allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.  Phenylephrine acts as a decongestant by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and improving airflow.  The combination tackles both the allergic and congestion aspects of upper respiratory illnesses.
