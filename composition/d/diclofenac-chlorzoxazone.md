# Diclofenac + Chlorzoxazone

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Chlorzoxazone

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders.  Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Chlorzoxazone is a muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms.  This combination is often prescribed for conditions like acute musculoskeletal pain, back pain, and other similar conditions where both pain and muscle spasm are present.  It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for all musculoskeletal pain and should be prescribed by a doctor after proper evaluation.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but common ones include:

* **From Diclofenac:**  Stomach upset (indigestion, heartburn, nausea, vomiting), diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, increased risk of bleeding,  kidney problems (especially in those with pre-existing kidney issues), increased blood pressure,  allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke) - especially with long-term use or high doses.
* **From Chlorzoxazone:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, weakness.  Rarely, allergic reactions can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:**  Works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Chlorzoxazone:**  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to act centrally in the nervous system to relax skeletal muscles.  It does not directly affect the muscles themselves.
