# Dosulepin
### Generic Name
Dosulepin (also known as Dothiepin)

### Usage
Dosulepin is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat depression, both acute and as a maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.  It's also effective in managing anxiety that often accompanies depression.  While not its primary indication, some evidence suggests it may be helpful in certain cases of chronic pain, although more research is needed in this area.  It's crucial to remember that Dosulepin should only be used under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Dosulepin is usually started at a low dose (25mg) three times a day or as a single dose at bedtime for the first one to two weeks. For elderly patients, the starting dose is typically lower (50-75mg/day).  The doctor will gradually increase the daily dose (by 25-50mg) every 1-2 weeks, as needed,  up to a maximum of 225mg per day. The higher daily dose can be taken as a single dose at bedtime.  Maintenance doses for the elderly are usually half the normal adult dose.  It is extremely important to follow the doctor's instructions precisely and never adjust the dose independently.  When stopping the medication after more than three weeks of use, the dose should be tapered off gradually (over 2-4 weeks) to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

**Children:** Dosulepin is not approved for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided by the manufacturer for patients with mild to moderate hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and reduced doses may be considered in such cases.  Dosulepin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  A 14-day gap is necessary between stopping a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and starting Dosulepin, and vice versa.

### How it Works
Dosulepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. These are neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that play a crucial role in mood regulation. By blocking their reuptake by nerve cells, Dosulepin makes more of these neurotransmitters available in the synapses (the spaces between nerve cells), thereby improving mood and reducing anxiety symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dosulepin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components (cross-sensitivity with other tricyclic antidepressants is possible), those who have recently taken or are currently taking MAOIs, those with acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction, heart block, severe hepatic impairment, angle-closure glaucoma, mania, or epilepsy. Those with allergies to peanuts or soya should also avoid this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dosulepin can interact with many other medications, including those that prolong the QT interval (increasing the risk of irregular heartbeats), barbiturates, tranquilizers, CNS depressants, guanethidine, other adrenergic neuron-blocking drugs, anticholinergics, antihistamines, sympathomimetics, diuretics, and antiepileptics.  The combination of Dosulepin with MAOIs can be dangerous.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your healthcare provider before starting Dosulepin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dosulepin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so it should be used with caution during breastfeeding and only after careful consideration of the risks and benefits by a healthcare provider.
* **Specific Populations:** Older adults, patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, prostatic hypertrophy,  renal impairment, those at risk for seizures, hyperthyroidism, and those with decreased gastrointestinal motility or urinary retention should use Dosulepin with extra caution and under close medical supervision.
