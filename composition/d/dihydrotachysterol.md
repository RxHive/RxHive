# Dihydrotachysterol
### Generic Name
Dihydrotachysterol

### Usage

Dihydrotachysterol is a synthetic form of vitamin D.  Its primary use is in the treatment and prevention of conditions characterized by low blood calcium (hypocalcemia),  most notably hypoparathyroidism (where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone, crucial for calcium regulation). It's also used to treat or prevent:

* **Rickets:** A bone disease in children caused by vitamin D deficiency.
* **Tetany:** Muscle spasms and cramps resulting from low blood calcium. This includes various forms, such as idiopathic tetany (cause unknown) and postoperative tetany (following surgery).
* **Hypophosphatemia:** Low levels of phosphate in the blood.
* **Osteoporosis:** A condition characterized by weakened bones.
* **Renal osteodystrophy:** Bone disease associated with kidney failure.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.  The following represents general dosage ranges; *individual needs may differ considerably.*

**Adults:** Oral administration is standard.  Dosages are typically initiated at a higher level for a few days to achieve therapeutic effects, then reduced to a maintenance dose.

* **Hypocalcemia:** Initial dose: 0.25–0.8 mg daily for several days; Maintenance dose: 0.2–1 mg daily.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:** Initial dose: 0.8–2.4 mg daily for 4 days; Maintenance dose: 0.2–1 mg daily.
* **Hypophosphatemia, Tetany (various forms):** Initial dose: 0.8–2.4 mg daily for several days; Maintenance dose: 0.2–1 mg daily.
* **Osteoporosis:** 6 mg daily (often used in conjunction with calcium and fluoride supplements).
* **Renal Osteodystrophy:** 0.1–0.6 mg daily.
* **Rickets:** 0.5 mg daily or 13–50 mcg/day until healing is observed.


**Children:** Dosage is significantly lower and depends heavily on age and weight. A doctor will determine the appropriate dose for a child, considering their individual needs and condition.

* **Hypoparathyroidism:** Neonates: 0.05–0.1 mg daily; Infants and Children: Initial dose: 1–5 mg daily for 4 days; Maintenance dose: 0.5–1.5 mg daily.
* **Renal osteodystrophy:** 0.1–0.5 mg daily.
* **Rickets:** 0.5 mg daily or 13–50 mcg/day until healing is observed.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare professional must carefully monitor patients with these conditions.

### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Headache
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Metallic taste

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Mental confusion
* Coma
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Seizures
* Metastatic calcification (calcium deposits in tissues)
* Renal insufficiency (kidney failure) – manifested as polyuria (excessive urination), nocturia (frequent nighttime urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and proteinuria (protein in the urine).


**If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Dihydrotachysterol is a vitamin D analog.  After being ingested, it undergoes modifications in the liver, becoming active. This active form binds to vitamin D receptors within cells, affecting the expression of genes that regulate calcium and phosphate metabolism. This leads to increased calcium absorption from the intestines and enhanced reabsorption of calcium and phosphate from the kidneys, ultimately raising blood levels of these minerals to appropriate levels.  It also plays a role in bone mineralization.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dihydrotachysterol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), abnormal sensitivity to vitamin D, and hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D toxicity).
* **Interactions:** Thiazide diuretics (certain blood pressure medications) can increase the risk of hypercalcemia when taken concurrently with dihydrotachysterol.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, renal disease, sarcoidosis, other medications, allergies or during breastfeeding.  Careful monitoring of blood calcium levels is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Dihydrotachysterol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C (potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out).  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Dihydrotachysterol?**  A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Dihydrotachysterol suddenly?** A: No, always consult your doctor before stopping this medication. Abrupt cessation could lead to a relapse of symptoms.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I take Dihydrotachysterol with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q:  Are there any dietary restrictions while taking Dihydrotachysterol?** A: Your doctor may advise you on appropriate dietary calcium and phosphate intake. They might also recommend avoiding antacids containing magnesium or calcium.
