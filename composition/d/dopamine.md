# Dopamine
### Generic Name
Dopamine

### Usage
Dopamine is primarily used as an adjunct treatment to correct hemodynamic imbalances in various shock states.  These shock states might stem from conditions such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), open-heart surgery, renal failure (kidney failure), and cardiac decompensation (heart failure) that persist even after adequate fluid replacement.  It's crucial to understand that dopamine is *not* a first-line treatment for shock; it's used *after* fluid resuscitation has been attempted.  It's also sometimes used off-label for inotropic support in advanced heart failure and in certain cases of cardiogenic shock or hypotension, particularly post-cardiac arrest situations where symptomatic bradycardia is present.  Its use in these scenarios should be guided by appropriate clinical guidelines and the expertise of healthcare professionals.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dopamine's hemodynamic effects are dose-dependent, although there's some overlap between dosage ranges.  It is administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion, typically using an infusion pump for precise control.

* **Hemodynamic Support (Shock):** The dosage range is 2-20 mcg/kg/min.  It's titrated gradually upwards, in increments of 5-10 mcg/kg/min, to achieve the optimal response. However, doses exceeding 20 mcg/kg/min may not offer additional benefits and could increase the risk of tachyarrhythmias (rapid heartbeats).  The maximum dose is generally 50 mcg/kg/min, though exceeding 20-30 mcg/kg/min often suggests that a more direct-acting vasopressor (like epinephrine or norepinephrine) might be more appropriate.

* **Inotropic Support (Advanced Heart Failure):** The dosage typically ranges from 5-15 mcg/kg/min via IV infusion.

* **Cardiogenic Shock (Off-label):**  0.5-20 mcg/kg/min IV.

* **Hypotension with Symptomatic Bradycardia (Post-Cardiac Arrest, Off-label):** Initial dose: 5-10 mcg/kg/min IV, titrated to effect (following established ACLS guidelines).


**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage adjustments for children are not specifically different, but the approach is similar.

* **Hemodynamic Support (Shock):** 2-20 mcg/kg/min via continuous IV or intraosseous infusion, titrated upward in 5-10 mcg/kg/min increments.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, anxiety.

* **Cardiovascular:**  Tachycardia (rapid heart rate), bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension (low blood pressure), palpitations, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), angina pectoris (chest pain), vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels).  More serious cardiovascular effects like ventricular arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms originating in the ventricles) can occur.

* **Other Possible Side Effects:**  Increased intraocular pressure, mydriasis (pupil dilation), dyspnea (shortness of breath), azotemia (increased nitrogenous waste in the blood), polyuria (increased urination), gangrene (tissue death, typically associated with high doses and extravasation), piloerection ("goosebumps"), increased serum glucose levels, tissue necrosis.

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, immediately contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Dopamine acts on multiple receptors in the body. At lower doses, it primarily stimulates dopaminergic receptors, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) in the kidneys and mesentery (the membrane that supports the abdominal organs). This increases renal blood flow and urine output. As the dose increases, it also stimulates beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, leading to increased heart rate, contractility (force of heart muscle contractions), and cardiac output.  At high doses, alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation predominates, resulting in vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and a rise in blood pressure.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dopamine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfites (a preservative in some formulations), pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), uncorrected tachyarrhythmias, and ventricular fibrillation.

* **Increased Risk:**  Dopamine increases the risk of arrhythmias, hypotension, and extravasation (leakage of the drug from the vein into surrounding tissues).

* **Cautions:** Use with extreme caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmias, occlusive vascular disease, active myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), recent myocardial infarction, or those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  Exercise caution in breastfeeding women.

* **Extravasation Management:** Extravasation can cause significant tissue damage. If extravasation occurs, immediately stop the infusion, attempt gentle aspiration, and administer an antidote such as phentolamine to counteract the vasoconstrictive effects.

* **Pregnancy:** Dopamine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on the fetus are unknown.  Its use during post-resuscitation may be considered but the potential fetal effects must be carefully weighed.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is dopamine stored?** A: Dopamine solutions should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically under refrigeration.

* **Q: How long does it take for dopamine to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the dose and the patient's condition, but effects are generally seen relatively quickly.

* **Q: Can dopamine be given as a bolus injection?** A: No, dopamine should never be administered as a bolus; it must be given as a continuous infusion.

* **Q: What are the long-term risks of dopamine use?** A: Prolonged intravenous inotropic therapy without a specific indication, except for palliative reasons, is potentially harmful.

* **Q: What happens if I miss a dose?** A:  Dopamine is administered continuously in the hospital setting by healthcare professionals, so "missed doses" are not relevant in this context. Changes in dosage are made under direct medical supervision.  If there are interruptions in the infusion, this is managed medically.
