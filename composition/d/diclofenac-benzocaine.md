# Diclofenac + Benzocaine

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Benzocaine (Various brand names exist depending on the country and formulation)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is a topical analgesic (pain reliever) used to relieve pain and inflammation in minor skin injuries such as:

* Sprains
* Strains
* Bruises
* Minor burns
* Cuts
* Arthritic pain in joints near the skin surface

It's important to note that this combination is *not* suitable for treating all types of pain or inflammation.  Always check the product label and consult a doctor or pharmacist if unsure about its suitability.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* Skin irritation (redness, itching, burning) at the application site. This is the most frequent side effect.
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.
*  In rare cases, systemic absorption of diclofenac can occur, leading to side effects associated with oral diclofenac, such as:
    * Stomach upset
    * Nausea
    * Headache
    * Dizziness

**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to both.
* **Benzocaine:** This is a local anesthetic. It works by numbing the area of application, providing temporary relief from pain.  The combined action of diclofenac reducing inflammation and benzocaine numbing the area offers a more comprehensive pain relief effect.

**FAQs:**

* **How often can I apply it?** Follow the instructions on the product label. Typically, it's applied several times a day, but never exceed the recommended dosage.
* **How long will it take to work?** The numbing effect of benzocaine is usually felt quickly, while the anti-inflammatory effect of diclofenac takes a little longer.
* **Can I use it on open wounds or broken skin?** No, it should not be applied to open wounds, broken skin, or mucous membranes.
* **Can I use it for children?**  Use only as directed by a doctor and never apply to children without explicit medical supervision due to the potential for systemic absorption and side effects.  Many formulations are not recommended for children.
* **Can I use it with other medications?** Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are taking to avoid potential interactions, especially other NSAIDs or blood thinners.
* **What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** Stop using the medication immediately and seek medical attention.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Simply apply the next dose as scheduled. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I use it long-term?** Prolonged use should be avoided unless directed by a physician. Long-term use can increase the risk of side effects.
