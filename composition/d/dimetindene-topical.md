# Dimetindene (Topical)
### Generic Name
Dimethindene (Topical)

### Usage
Dimethindene topical is a histamine H<sub>1</sub> antagonist used to relieve itching associated with various skin irritations.  Its primary use is to treat the itching caused by conditions like insect bites, minor burns, rashes, and other minor skin irritations.  While it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the irritation, it effectively reduces the itching sensation, providing symptomatic relief.


### Dosage
**Skin Irritation:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥ 2 years:**  For topical application as a gel (0.1% concentration), apply a thin layer to the affected area 2 to 4 times daily.  

**Important Note:** The provided dosage information is based on common formulations.  Always refer to the specific instructions on your medication's label for the exact dosage and application method.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Erythema (redness), pruritus (itching), skin irritation, and dryness (xeroderma).
* **Less Common (but potentially serious):** Allergic dermatitis, burning sensation. Hypersensitivity reactions are possible, though rare.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are persistent or worsen, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Dimethindene is an H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a substance released by the body during allergic reactions and inflammatory processes, causing itching and inflammation.  Dimethindene blocks histamine from binding to its receptors, preventing these reactions and thus reducing itching and inflammation at the site of application.  It also has a mild local anesthetic effect that can further contribute to itch relief.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Dimethindene topical should not be used if you are hypersensitive to dimethindene or any component of the formulation.  It is also contraindicated for use on open wounds, inflamed skin, eczema, weeping dermatitis, mucous membranes, or around the eyes. It should also be avoided if there is a known insecticide allergy.

* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity and photosensitivity reactions.  Use should be limited to a short duration (generally no longer than 3 days) and to small areas of skin.  Prolonged or extensive use should be avoided, particularly in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  Some manufacturers recommend against use in the first trimester of pregnancy.  The safety and efficacy in children under 2 years of age is not established for over-the-counter use.  Always consult a healthcare professional before applying this medication to children under 2.
