# Dexamethasone + Gatifloxacin
### Generic Name

Dexamethasone + Gatifloxacin (Combination)


**Note:**  Dexamethasone and Gatifloxacin are typically not combined into a single medication product.  They are often prescribed together, but as separate medications. This information describes the individual drugs and their combined use.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for taking any medication.


### Usage

This combination is primarily used for treating severe ear infections (otitis externa or otitis media) that don't respond to other treatments.  Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and swelling in the ear canal. Gatifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, kills bacteria causing the infection.  The combined effect targets both the infection and the associated inflammation.  This combined therapy might also be considered in other cases of severe bacterial infections where significant inflammation is present, but this would be a physician's decision based on individual circumstances.  It's crucial to understand that this combination is *not* a first-line treatment and is usually reserved for infections resistant to other antibiotics.


### Dosage

**Dosage must be determined by a physician and will vary greatly depending on the specific infection, patient age, weight, and overall health.** There is no standard combined dosage since Dexamethasone and Gatifloxacin are typically administered as separate medications.  A doctor will prescribe the appropriate dose of each drug individually.

* **Dexamethasone:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (oral, intravenous, topical), the condition being treated, and the patient's characteristics.  Dosage forms include tablets, injections, and eye/ear drops.

* **Gatifloxacin:** Dosage forms include eye drops and ear drops. Dosage will depend on the type and severity of infection.


**Important:** Never attempt to determine the dosage of either drug on your own. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.


### Side Effects

* Increased appetite

**Serious but less common side effects (for both):**  Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), tendon rupture, and other serious adverse effects are possible, though infrequent.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual side effects.


### How it Works

**Dexamethasone:** This corticosteroid works by reducing inflammation. It decreases the production of substances that cause swelling, redness, and pain.

**Gatifloxacin:** This fluoroquinolone antibiotic works by inhibiting the enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) that bacterial cells need to replicate their DNA.  By blocking these enzymes, the drug prevents bacterial growth and leads to their death.  This combination addresses both the infection (Gatifloxacin) and the inflammatory response (Dexamethasone).


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with known allergies to corticosteroids or fluoroquinolones should not use this combination.
* **Interactions:**  Gatifloxacin may interact with certain medications, such as antacids or anticoagulants.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be carefully evaluated by a physician as dosing may be significantly different than adult dosing.
* **Elderly:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Careful monitoring is needed.
* **Liver/Kidney Disease:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.
