# Diloxanide + Tinidazole

**Generic Name:** Diloxanide furoate + Tinidazole

**Usage:**  Diloxanide furoate + tinidazole is used to treat amoebiasis, a parasitic infection of the intestines caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  It's typically prescribed for intestinal amoebiasis, specifically to eradicate both the trophozoites (active, feeding forms) and cysts (dormant, infectious forms) of the parasite.  It's often used in combination because diloxanide furoate is more effective against the intestinal cysts, while tinidazole targets the trophozoites more effectively and also has some activity against cysts.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, metallic taste in the mouth.
* **Neurological:** Headache, dizziness, vertigo.
* **Hematological:**  Transient neutropenia (low white blood cell count â€“ rare).
* **Other:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives), dark urine (due to tinidazole).

More serious side effects are rare but can include:  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), blood disorders, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage).  If any serious side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

* **Diloxanide furoate:**  This drug is an amoebicide that works by interfering with the energy metabolism of *Entamoeba histolytica*, leading to the death of the parasite. It's primarily active against the cyst form of the parasite in the intestines.

* **Tinidazole:** This is a nitroimidazole antibiotic that works by interfering with the parasite's DNA. This action is effective against both the trophozoite and cyst forms of *Entamoeba histolytica*.  It acts by disrupting the parasite's DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms.

The combination therapy ensures broader coverage against the parasite in both its active and dormant stages, improving the likelihood of successful treatment.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the specific dosage regimen prescribed by the physician, typically ranging from 5-10 days.  Follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: No.  Alcohol should be avoided during treatment and for at least 24-72 hours after completing the course of tinidazole due to potential for a disulfiram-like reaction (severe nausea, vomiting, headache).

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, there can be interactions with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements) you are taking.

* **Q: Is this medication safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before taking this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Q: How will I know if the treatment was successful?** A: Your doctor will likely perform follow-up stool tests to confirm the eradication of the parasite.
