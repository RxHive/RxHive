# Diloxanide + Tinidazole
### Generic Name
Diloxanide furoate + Tinidazole


### Usage

Diloxanide furoate and tinidazole combination is primarily used to treat intestinal amoebiasis, a parasitic infection caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  This combination therapy targets both the luminal (intestinal) and tissue stages of the infection. Diloxanide furoate is effective against the luminal forms of *E. histolytica* residing in the intestines, while tinidazole tackles both luminal and tissue forms, eradicating the parasite from both the gut and potentially invaded tissues.  While primarily used for amoebiasis, this combination might be considered in specific cases of other parasitic infections,  but this should always be under the strict guidance of a physician.  It's crucial to remember that this combination is not a first-line treatment for all parasitic infections and should only be used as prescribed by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a physician and will vary depending on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection. There isn't a universally standardized dosage across all formulations.  Information provided here is for illustrative purposes only and should **not** be taken as medical advice.


**Typical Adult Dosage (Oral):**  This usually involves a specific number of tablets or capsules of the combined formulation taken at once or divided over several days, according to the doctor's prescription.  The duration of treatment is typically short, lasting a few days.


**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):** Dosage for children is carefully calculated based on weight and age and is usually lower than adult dosages.  Syrup formulations may exist but are not universally available.  Again, strict adherence to the physicianâ€™s instructions is paramount.


**IV Administration:**  This combination is not typically administered intravenously. Treatment for amoebiasis usually involves oral medication.


**Important Note:**  Never adjust the dosage or duration of treatment without consulting a doctor.  Incorrect dosage could result in treatment failure or adverse effects.  Always read and follow the instructions provided with the specific medication dispensed by the pharmacist.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, metallic taste in the mouth, headache. These are generally mild and transient.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe allergic reactions (e.g., skin rashes, swelling, difficulty breathing),  neurological effects (e.g., dizziness, confusion, seizures), blood disorders.
* **Other Potential Side Effects:** Changes in bowel movements, dark urine, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Diloxanide furoate acts primarily by interfering with the metabolic processes of *Entamoeba histolytica* in the lumen of the intestines, leading to its destruction.  Tinidazole, a nitroimidazole, works by disrupting the DNA of the parasite. It enters the parasitic cells and interferes with their DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms, leading to parasite death. This dual mechanism ensures broader effectiveness against the parasite in various stages of infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should be avoided in individuals with known hypersensitivity to diloxanide furoate, tinidazole, or other nitroimidazoles.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Interactions with certain medications are possible, although not extensively documented for this specific combination.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used under strict medical supervision if the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Alcohol consumption should be avoided during treatment and for a short period afterward, due to potential interactions with tinidazole.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and might require careful monitoring.
