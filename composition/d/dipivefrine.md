# Dipivefrine
### Generic Name
Dipivefrine

### Usage

Dipivefrine is primarily used as an adjunct therapy in managing open-angle glaucoma and intraocular hypertension.  It's not typically used as a standalone treatment for these conditions but rather works in conjunction with other glaucoma medications to lower intraocular pressure (IOP).  Its use is focused on reducing the pressure within the eye, thereby helping to prevent damage to the optic nerve associated with these conditions.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  For both open-angle glaucoma and intraocular hypertension, the typical dosage is one drop of 0.1% dipivefrine ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of dipivefrine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  

**Switching Medications:** When switching from other glaucoma medications to dipivefrine, a transition period is usually recommended. This often involves using both the previous medication and dipivefrine for a day before discontinuing the previous medication.  Consult a physician for specific transition instructions.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Fast or irregular heartbeat (tachycardia)
*   Increased blood pressure
*   Eye irritation (burning, stinging)
*   Eye pain
*   Eye itching
*   Eye redness
*   Eyelid swelling (edema)
*   Conjunctival swelling (edema)
*   Excessive tearing (watering eyes)
*   Skin rashes or hives

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Headache
*   Blurred vision
*   Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)
*   Pupil dilation (mydriasis)


**Serious Side Effects:** While less frequent, serious side effects can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.


### How it Works

Dipivefrine is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form (epinephrine) in the body. Epinephrine acts as a sympathomimetic agent, primarily by:

1.  **Decreasing aqueous humor production:**  Aqueous humor is the fluid that fills the eye's anterior chamber.  By reducing its production, intraocular pressure is lowered.
2.  **Improving uveoscleral outflow:** This refers to the drainage of aqueous humor through the uveoscleral pathway.  Improving this outflow further helps to reduce IOP.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Dipivefrine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

*   Hypersensitivity to dipivefrine, epinephrine, or any of the formulation's components
*   Narrow-angle glaucoma


**Warnings and Precautions:**

*   Use with caution in patients with aphakia (absence of the eye lens) and in breastfeeding women.  The safety of dipivefrine during pregnancy isn't fully established.
*   Numerous drug interactions are possible.  This medication should be used cautiously with beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other medications that affect cardiovascular function or blood pressure.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
*   The ophthalmic solution is for topical ocular use only and should not be injected or taken orally.
*   Avoid contact between the dropper tip and the eyes or any other surface to prevent contamination.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for dipivefrine to work?**

A: The effect on IOP usually begins within a short time after administration, but the full therapeutic effect may not be seen immediately.  Regular use as prescribed is necessary for sustained IOP reduction.

**Q: Can I stop taking dipivefrine suddenly?**

A: No, you should not stop taking dipivefrine suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Abrupt cessation could lead to a rebound increase in IOP.  Your doctor will guide you on how to safely discontinue the medication.

**Q: How should I store dipivefrine?**

A: Store dipivefrine at room temperature, away from direct light and moisture.  Discard any unused portion after the expiration date.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, apply it as soon as you remember.  However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q:  Are there any specific dietary restrictions while using dipivefrine?**

A:  There are no specific dietary restrictions associated with dipivefrine use, but maintaining a healthy diet is always beneficial for overall health.
