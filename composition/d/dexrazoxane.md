# Dexrazoxane
### Generic Name
Dexrazoxane

### Usage
Dexrazoxane is primarily used to prevent cardiomyopathy (heart muscle damage) caused by doxorubicin, a common chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers.  Doxorubicin's effectiveness in killing cancer cells unfortunately comes with a risk of damaging the heart. Dexrazoxane helps mitigate this risk.  

A secondary, important use for Dexrazoxane is in the treatment of anthracycline extravasation.  Extravasation occurs when an intravenous (IV) anthracycline drug, such as doxorubicin, leaks out of the vein into the surrounding tissue. This leakage can cause significant pain, inflammation, and tissue damage.  Dexrazoxane helps to limit the damage caused by this extravasation.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The information below is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual patient needs and factors such as age, weight, overall health, and the specific condition being treated.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (prophylaxis):**  The typical dose is a 10:1 ratio of dexrazoxane to doxorubicin. For example, 500 mg/m² of dexrazoxane would be given for every 50 mg/m² of doxorubicin.  It's administered intravenously (IV) as a slow push or rapid drip infusion. Doxorubicin is given within 30 minutes of starting the dexrazoxane infusion.  Careful monitoring of cardiac function is crucial.

* **Anthracycline extravasation:** The dosage varies depending on the extent of extravasation but generally involves 1000 mg/m² on days 1 and 2 (not exceeding 2000 mg total), followed by 500 mg/m² on day 3 (not exceeding 1000 mg). Treatment should begin as soon as possible, ideally within 6 hours of extravasation.  Administration is intravenous.

**Pediatric Dosage:**
The safety and efficacy of dexrazoxane in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Problems):**  For cardiomyopathy prophylaxis, if the doxorubicin dose needs to be reduced due to liver problems, dexrazoxane should also be reduced proportionally to maintain the 10:1 ratio. For anthracycline extravasation, use in patients with liver impairment is generally not recommended. Liver function tests (LFTs) should be carefully monitored.

* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Problems):** For mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min), no dosage adjustment is usually necessary. For moderate to severe impairment (creatinine clearance <40 mL/min), the dose may need to be reduced by 50% for both prophylaxis and extravasation treatment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in ≥10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Injection site pain
* Decreased white blood cell count
* Fever
* Infection

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bone marrow suppression
* Development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) - These are rare but serious risks.
* Severe allergic reactions


**If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Dexrazoxane is a type of chelating agent.  In the context of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, it's thought to work by interfering with the formation of damaging free radicals generated by doxorubicin and iron within heart cells. These free radicals are believed to contribute significantly to heart muscle damage.

In anthracycline extravasation, dexrazoxane may protect tissue from the cytotoxic effects of the anthracycline by reversibly inhibiting topoisomerase II, an enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. This action helps to minimize tissue damage caused by the drug leaking out of the vein.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dexrazoxane is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to dexrazoxane or any component of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:** Dexrazoxane can interact with other medications, particularly other myelosuppressive agents (drugs that suppress bone marrow function).  Consult your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dexrazoxane is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus. It's not recommended during pregnancy.  The excretion of dexrazoxane in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for two weeks after the last dose.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dexrazoxane should be used cautiously in patients with kidney or liver problems, with potential dose adjustments necessary depending on the severity of impairment.

* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Dexrazoxane can increase the risk of bone marrow suppression, leading to reduced blood cell counts.  Regular blood tests are important to monitor for this.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is dexrazoxane administered?** A: Dexrazoxane is administered intravenously (IV).

* **Q: How long does it take for dexrazoxane to work?** A: The effects of dexrazoxane vary depending on its use. For cardiomyopathy prevention, it works prophylactically, reducing the risk of heart damage. For extravasation, it aims to minimize immediate tissue damage.

* **Q: How should dexrazoxane be stored?** A:  Store as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Usually, it involves storage at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take dexrazoxane with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your healthcare provider before starting dexrazoxane to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of dexrazoxane?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance; do not attempt to make up for missed doses on your own.

* **Q: Is dexrazoxane addictive?** A: No, dexrazoxane is not considered an addictive substance.
