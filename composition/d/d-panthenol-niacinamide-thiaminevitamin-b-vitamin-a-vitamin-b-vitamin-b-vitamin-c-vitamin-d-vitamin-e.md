# D-Panthenol + Niacinamide + ThiamineVitamin B + Vitamin A + Vitamin B + Vitamin B + Vitamin C + Vitamin D + Vitamin E

It's impossible to provide specific details on a product containing "D-Panthenol + Niacinamide + ThiamineVitamin B + Vitamin A + Vitamin B + Vitamin B + Vitamin C + Vitamin D + Vitamin E" without knowing the specific concentrations of each ingredient and the formulation itself.  This list is incomplete and redundant (lists Vitamin B multiple times without specifying which B vitamin).  A proper formulation would list each vitamin specifically (e.g., Vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, etc.).

Therefore, I can only offer general information based on the individual components commonly found in skincare and health supplements.  This should **not** be taken as medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or dermatologist before using any new product, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are taking medications.
