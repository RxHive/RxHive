# Diflorasone
### Generic Name
Diflorasone

### Usage
Diflorasone is a topical corticosteroid primarily used to relieve the inflammation and itching associated with various corticosteroid-responsive skin conditions.  These conditions include eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin diseases.  It's important to remember that Diflorasone only treats the symptoms and not the underlying cause of the skin condition.

### Dosage
Dosage depends on the severity of the condition and the area being treated.  Generally, a thin film of Diflorasone cream or ointment (0.05%) is applied to the affected area one to three times daily.  The exact frequency will be determined by your doctor.

**Adults:**  Application varies from once to three times a day, depending on the severity of the condition and the area of application.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of Diflorasone in children have not been established.  Therefore, it should not be used in children unless explicitly prescribed and monitored by a pediatrician.

**Important Note:** Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Burning
* Dryness
* Itching
* Irritation
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Thinning of the skin
* Stretch marks (striae)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Acneiform eruptions
* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth)
* Hypopigmentation (loss of skin color)
* Perioral dermatitis (rash around the mouth)
* Secondary skin infections
* Skin atrophy (thinning and weakening of the skin)
* Worsening of existing skin conditions (such as psoriasis)
* Systemic effects (rare but potentially serious) â€“ These may include adrenal suppression (inhibition of cortisol production) with possible symptoms like weakness, fatigue and weight loss.  They are much more likely to occur with long-term or widespread use, and high potency corticosteroids like this one.


If you experience any side effects, especially unusual ones or those that worsen, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Diflorasone is a high-potency topical corticosteroid.  It works by reducing inflammation and itching in the skin.  This is achieved by suppressing the activity of certain cells and chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation.  Specifically, Diflorasone inhibits the release of substances that cause inflammation and reduce the blood flow to the affected area, thereby alleviating symptoms such as swelling, redness, and itching.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Diflorasone is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Diflorasone or any components of the formulation. It should not be applied to areas of skin infection, unless the infection is being treated concomitantly.  It should also not be used to treat rosacea or perioral dermatitis.

* **Interactions:**  Diflorasone may interact with other medications, particularly immunosuppressants.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.  Specifically, the interaction with Aldesleukin should be avoided.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Diflorasone during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Children:**  Diflorasone should only be used in children under the direct supervision of a doctor due to the potential for side effects.

* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Do not use occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.  Long-term use or use over large areas of skin should be avoided to minimize the risk of systemic side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see results varies depending on the condition and individual response.  Improvement may be seen within a few days to weeks.

* **Q: Can I use Diflorasone on my face?** A: Generally, Diflorasone is not recommended for use on the face, axillae (armpits) or groin areas because of the increased risk of side effects.
