### How it Works
Dextropropoxyphene primarily works by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. This interaction reduces the perception of pain signals.  Additionally, it also interacts with other receptors affecting neurotransmission, but the exact mechanisms and their relative contributions to its analgesic effect were not fully understood.
