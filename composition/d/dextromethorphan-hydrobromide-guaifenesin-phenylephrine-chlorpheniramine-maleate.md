# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works in the brain to reduce the urge to cough.
* **Chest Congestion:** Guaifenesin is an expectorant. It helps to loosen and thin the mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Nasal Congestion:** Phenylephrine is a nasal decongestant. It shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Runny Nose, Sneezing, Itchy, Watery Eyes:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine. It blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing these symptoms.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, particularly with the antihistamine and cough suppressant.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:** A common effect of antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Insomnia (difficulty sleeping):**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:**  More likely with higher doses of phenylephrine.
* **Irritability (in children):**


**Serious but less common side effects include:**

* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms can range from rash and itching to swelling of the face, lips, or tongue and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Fast or irregular heartbeat:**
* **High blood pressure:**
* **Seizures:**  More likely with high doses of dextromethorphan.


**How it Works:** The medication works by targeting different aspects of cold and flu symptoms.  Each active ingredient has a specific mechanism:

* **Dextromethorphan:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Guaifenesin:** Thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to expel from the lungs.
* **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Blocks the action of histamine, reducing runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
