# Dexketoprofen
### Generic Name
Dexketoprofen

### Usage
Dexketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for the relief of mild to moderate pain and inflammation.  Its analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory properties make it effective for various conditions, including:

* **Acute pain:**  Such as pain following dental procedures, musculoskeletal pain (e.g., sprains, strains, back pain), and post-surgical pain.
* **Dysmenorrhea:** Painful menstruation.
* **Other inflammatory conditions:** While not a first-line treatment for most chronic inflammatory conditions, it may provide temporary pain relief in some cases.

It's important to note that Dexketoprofen is designed for short-term use in managing acute pain; it's not typically suitable for long-term management of chronic pain conditions.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the type of formulation (oral tablets, granules for oral solution, intramuscular (IM) injection, or intravenous (IV) injection), the severity of pain, and the patient's overall health.  **Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.**

* **Adults (Oral):**  The usual dose is 12.5 mg every 4-6 hours or 25 mg every 8 hours, not exceeding 75 mg per day. Granules for oral solution might have a slightly different recommended dosage – always check the product information.

* **Adults (IM/IV):**  The usual dose is 50 mg every 8-12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg.  Intravenous administration should be slow, and intramuscular injections should be deep into the muscle.  Parenteral (IM/IV) administration is typically limited to a short duration (no more than 2 days) for acute pain relief.

* **Children:** Dexketoprofen is generally not recommended for children.  Always consult a pediatrician before giving any medication to a child.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal or hepatic impairment may require dosage adjustments or contraindicate use altogether.  Older adults might also require lower doses due to increased sensitivity. Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your individual needs and health status.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of Dexketoprofen can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Sleepiness


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, may include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration
* Allergic reactions (such as rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Cardiovascular problems (such as heart attack or stroke – although a causal link is still under investigation)
* Liver or kidney problems


If you experience any concerning side effects, especially severe or persistent ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Dexketoprofen is a non-selective NSAID that works by inhibiting the production of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.  COX enzymes are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which play a crucial role in mediating pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, Dexketoprofen decreases pain and inflammation, leading to pain relief.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dexketoprofen is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Dexketoprofen or other NSAIDs, active peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding, severe heart failure, severe renal or hepatic impairment, and during the third trimester of pregnancy. It's also contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dexketoprofen may interact with other medications, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners), corticosteroids, lithium, and methotrexate.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women:** Dexketoprofen is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding.  Use during the first and second trimesters should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor for guidance.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to the side effects of NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney problems.  Lower doses may be necessary.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking Dexketoprofen to minimize the risk of gastrointestinal irritation.  If you have a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney disease, discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using Dexketoprofen.
