# Dexketoprofen

**Generic Name:** Dexketoprofen

**Usage:** Dexketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve mild to moderate pain, such as:

* Pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
* Post-surgical pain
* Dental pain
* Menstrual pain
* Migraine (in some formulations)


**Side Effects:**  Like all NSAIDs, dexketoprofen can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, indigestion,  ulcers (rare but serious), bleeding (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (especially with long-term use or high doses).
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (angioedema â€“ a serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention).
* **Other:** Fluid retention, increased potassium levels, ringing in the ears (tinnitus).

**How it Works:** Dexketoprofen is a non-selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor.  COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By inhibiting these enzymes, dexketoprofen reduces pain and inflammation.  The exact mechanism by which it reduces fever is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to its effect on prostaglandins in the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature).
