# Doravirine
### Generic Name
Doravirine

### Usage
Doravirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's crucial to understand that Doravirine is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral medications, never as a standalone treatment.  Its primary use is in patients who have never received antiretroviral therapy before.  A secondary use is to replace a current antiretroviral regimen in patients who are already virally suppressed (meaning their HIV-1 RNA levels are below 50 copies/mL) on a stable regimen, and who have no history of treatment failure or known resistance mutations to Doravirine.  The goal is to maintain viral suppression and improve long-term health outcomes for individuals with HIV-1.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The standard dose of Doravirine is 100 mg once daily (OD) taken orally. This is always part of a combination therapy regimen with other antiretrovirals as determined by a physician.  A notable exception is when co-administered with rifabutin; in this case, the dose increases to 100 mg twice daily (BID), approximately 12 hours apart, for the duration of rifabutin use.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Doravirine in children have not been established, and it's not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For adults with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed.  Information regarding dosage adjustments for those with severe hepatic impairment or end-stage renal disease is not provided in the manufacturer's labeling.  Similarly, for adults with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary; however, data on dosage adjustments for patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis are not available.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Fatigue

*   Dizziness
*   Abnormal dreams
*   Insomnia
*   Increased serum creatine kinase levels
*   Skin rash
*   Increased serum triglyceride levels
*   Nausea
*   Increased serum lipase levels
*   Diarrhea

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Doravirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  HIV uses reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA genetic material into DNA, which then integrates into the host cell's DNA. Doravirine works by directly binding to the reverse transcriptase enzyme, altering its shape and preventing it from functioning correctly. This inhibits the crucial step of converting RNA to DNA, effectively blocking HIV replication and preventing the virus from spreading.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Doravirine is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to Doravirine or any components of the formulation.  It's also contraindicated with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, enzalutamide, rifampin, rifapentine, mitotane, and St. John's wort),  as these drugs significantly reduce Doravirine's effectiveness.  The co-administration of Doravirine with certain antimycobacterials (rifampin, rifapentine) or anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) is contraindicated. Co-administration with enzalutamide or mitotane is also contraindicated.

**Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS) with the use of Doravirine. IRS is a condition that can occur when the immune system starts to recover, sometimes leading to inflammation and complications.  Close monitoring is essential.  The safety of Doravirine during pregnancy is not established. Breastfeeding is not recommended for individuals with HIV due to the risk of viral transmission.  Always consult your physician before using Doravirine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

**Drug Interactions:** Doravirine's metabolism is affected by other medications, particularly those that interact with the CYP3A enzyme system. Coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers decreases Doravirine's plasma concentration, reducing its efficacy. Conversely, strong inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations.  Furthermore, Doravirine is not recommended for concomitant use with other NNRTIs (like efavirenz, etravirine, and nevirapine) due to potential interactions.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Doravirine with food?** A:  Doravirine can be taken with or without food.

*   **Q: How should I store Doravirine?** A: Store Doravirine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Refer to the specific instructions on your medication label.

*   **Q:  Is Doravirine a cure for HIV?** A: No, Doravirine is not a cure for HIV. It's a crucial part of a combination therapy that helps manage the virus, suppressing its replication and improving the quality of life for people living with HIV.  Adherence to the prescribed regimen is crucial for its effectiveness.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one. Always follow your physician's guidance.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking Doravirine when I feel better?** A:  No, you should never stop taking Doravirine without consulting your healthcare provider. Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug resistance and worsen the condition.  Consistent medication adherence is vital for successful HIV management.
