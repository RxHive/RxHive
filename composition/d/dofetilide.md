# Dofetilide
### Generic Name
Dofetilide

### Usage

Dofetilide is a medication classified as a class III antiarrhythmic drug. Its primary use is in the management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and atrial flutter (AFL).  Specifically, it's used to convert these irregular heart rhythms back to a normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and to maintain that normal rhythm.  This is particularly relevant for patients who have experienced persistent AFib or AFL for over a week.  While not its primary indication, dofetilide may be used off-label in the ongoing management of some types of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).  However, its use for SVT should be carefully considered and under strict medical supervision due to potential risks.

### Dosage

Dofetilide dosage is highly individualized and depends critically on the patient's creatinine clearance (CrCl â€“ a measure of kidney function) and QTc interval (a measure of the heart's electrical activity).  A baseline QTc must be measured *before* starting dofetilide.  If the QTc is above 440 milliseconds (or 500 milliseconds in patients with certain ventricular conduction abnormalities), dofetilide is contraindicated (should not be used).

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**

* **Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter (prophylaxis/cardioversion):**
    * Initial dose: 500 mcg twice daily (BID)
    * Maximum dose: 500 mcg BID
    * Close monitoring of QTc is crucial, typically 2-3 hours post-initial dose.  If the QTc increases by more than 15% above baseline or exceeds 500 msec (550 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities), the dose should be reduced by 50%.
* **Supraventricular Tachycardia (off-label, ongoing management):**
    * Initial dose: 500 mcg every 12 hours

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on CrCl.  Lower doses are required for reduced kidney function.  For CrCl < 20 mL/min, dofetilide is contraindicated.  Dosage reduction is also needed if QTc exceeds thresholds noted above.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment, no adjustment may be needed, but severe impairment requires caution.  Specific dosage instructions aren't always clear, so close monitoring is required.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of dofetilide in children haven't been established.

**Important Note:**  The initial dosage and subsequent adjustments require careful medical supervision in a setting with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and resuscitation capabilities.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Headache is frequently reported.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  The most serious side effect is *torsades de pointes*, a potentially life-threatening type of irregular heartbeat. Other serious side effects include: ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, syncope, atrioventricular block, heart block, chest pain, and various other cardiovascular, neurological, and gastrointestinal issues.  Angioedema (swelling under the skin) and hepatotoxicity (liver damage) are also possible.


If any adverse effects occur, it is imperative to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug. This means it works by affecting the electrical signals in the heart that control its rhythm. Specifically, it blocks the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current in cardiac tissue.  This action lengthens the refractory period of atrial tissue, meaning the heart cells take longer to repolarize (reset) before they can fire again. This helps regulate the irregular heartbeats of AFib and AFL.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Dofetilide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug, prolonged QTc interval, heart rates below 60 bpm, severe renal impairment (CrCl < 20 mL/min), congenital or acquired long QT syndromes, and certain concurrent medications (see interactions).
* **Drug Interactions:** Dofetilide interacts with numerous other medications, many of which can increase its risks or their own risks. These include other antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, QTc-prolonging drugs, and many more.  Careful assessment of potential interactions is essential before initiating dofetilide.
* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of pro-arrhythmic effects (potentially dangerous heart rhythm disturbances).  Patients initiating or restarting dofetilide require close medical monitoring for several days. The risk of torsades de pointes is significant, emphasizing the need for careful electrolyte balance (particularly potassium and magnesium) monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Dofetilide is a Category C drug in pregnancy. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medicine.  The use of dofetilide during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dofetilide with food?** A: Dofetilide can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store dofetilide?** A:  Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking dofetilide suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping dofetilide can be dangerous.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q:  Are there any specific activities I should avoid while taking dofetilide?** A: Yes.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you, as dizziness or other side effects may impair your abilities.  Also, consult your doctor about the consumption of grapefruit juice, as it may affect the drug's metabolism.
* **Q: Who should I contact if I have questions or concerns?** A: Always contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have questions or concerns regarding the use of dofetilide.
