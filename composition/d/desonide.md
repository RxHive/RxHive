# Desonide

**Generic Name:** Desonide

**Usage:** Desonide is a corticosteroid used topically (applied to the skin) to relieve the inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions.  These include:

* Eczema (atopic dermatitis)
* Psoriasis
* Allergic reactions
* Insect bites
* Other inflammatory skin conditions


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and depend on the concentration of desonide, the area treated, and the duration of use.  They can include:

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or irritation at the application site. Skin thinning (atrophy) with prolonged use, especially in skin folds or on the face.  Stretch marks (striae).
* **Less Common:** Acne-like eruptions, increased hair growth (hirsutism), changes in skin pigmentation (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Systemic absorption (absorption into the bloodstream) can occur with prolonged use or application to large areas of the body, especially in infants and children.  This can lead to adrenal suppression (reduced function of the adrenal glands) and Cushing's syndrome (a hormonal disorder).  Allergic contact dermatitis is also possible.


**How it Works:** Desonide is a potent topical corticosteroid.  It works by reducing inflammation by binding to receptors inside skin cells.  This action suppresses the release of inflammatory chemicals, lessening redness, swelling, itching, and other symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  You may see improvement within a few days, but it might take several weeks for full benefit.
* **Can I use it on my face?**  It's generally best to avoid using desonide on the face unless specifically directed by a doctor due to increased risk of skin thinning.
* **Can I use it on children?** It can be used on children, but it's crucial to follow a doctor's instructions carefully due to the increased risk of systemic absorption.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Can I use other creams or lotions with it?**  Check with your doctor or pharmacist.  Some products might interfere with desonide's effectiveness or cause irritation.
* **How should I store it?** Store it at room temperature, away from heat and moisture.
* **How long can I use it?**  Do not use it for longer than prescribed by your doctor.  Prolonged use increases the risk of side effects.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you notice any significant side effects, especially skin thinning, increased hair growth, or changes in skin pigmentation.
