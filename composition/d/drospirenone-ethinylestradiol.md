# Drospirenone + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Drospirenone + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage

Drospirenone and Ethinylestradiol is a combined oral contraceptive pill containing a progestin (drospirenone) and an estrogen (ethinylestradiol). Its primary use is preventing pregnancy.  It achieves this by suppressing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus to hinder sperm penetration, and altering the uterine lining to prevent implantation.

Beyond contraception, this medication also has secondary uses:

* **Treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD):**  For women who choose to use an oral contraceptive, this combination can help manage the severe mood swings, irritability, and other symptoms characteristic of PMDD.

* **Treatment of Moderate Acne Vulgaris:** In women aged 14 and older who desire birth control, it may be used to treat moderate acne.  This use is secondary to its contraceptive function and is only considered if birth control is also desired.


### Dosage

The dosage is typically one tablet daily (containing 3 mg of drospirenone and 0.03 mg of ethinylestradiol). However, the starting day and schedule can vary:


* **Contraception (Sunday Start):** Begin on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation. If your period starts on a Sunday, take the first pill that day.  Use a backup contraceptive method for the first seven days.

* **Contraception (Day 1 Start):** Start on the first day of your menstrual cycle.

* **Switching from another hormonal contraceptive:** Start on the same day you would normally take your next pill from the previous method.

* **Switching from a patch, ring, or injection:** Start on the day your next dose would have been due.

* **Postpartum (non-breastfeeding) or post-abortion (second trimester):** Can be started at least four weeks after delivery or abortion. Pregnancy must be ruled out beforehand if menstrual periods haven't resumed, and a non-hormonal backup method should be used for the first seven days.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  This medication is not for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).  Its safety and efficacy have only been established in women of reproductive age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works

Drospirenone and ethinylestradiol work together to prevent pregnancy through a combination of mechanisms:

* **Ovulation Suppression:** The hormones suppress the release of an egg from the ovary.
* **Cervical Mucus Thickening:**  The hormones alter cervical mucus, making it thicker and more difficult for sperm to penetrate.
* **Endometrial Changes:** The hormones alter the lining of the uterus, making it less receptive to a fertilized egg.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of breast cancer or estrogen/progestin-sensitive cancers, active thromboembolic disease, liver disease, renal impairment, uncontrolled hypertension, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, pregnancy, or hypersensitivity to the drug components. It is also contraindicated in women using certain hepatitis C drug combinations.

* **Warnings:**  Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events when using combination oral contraceptives, especially in women over 35. This medication should not be used by women over 35 who smoke. There is an increased risk of breast, cervical, and liver cancer, as well as thromboembolic disorders, and other conditions. Careful consideration of risks and benefits is needed for women with risk factors for these conditions or with a history of depression, diabetes, or conditions worsened by fluid retention.

* **Drug Interactions:** This medication may interact with other drugs, potentially altering their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women (this medication is Category X in pregnancy and may reduce milk production), children, and older adults.
