# Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Terpin Hydrate + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Terpin Hydrate + Sodium Citrate  (This combination is not typically sold under a single generic name as it's a multi-ingredient formulation.  Individual components have their own generic names.)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is an expectorant and antitussive used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or the flu.  Specifically:

* **Diphenhydramine:** An antihistamine that reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies and colds. It also has sedative effects and can suppress a cough.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** An expectorant that helps loosen mucus and phlegm in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.
* **Terpin Hydrate:** Another expectorant that helps thin and loosen mucus.
* **Sodium Citrate:** A buffer that helps to adjust the pH and make the medication more palatable.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dose, but common ones include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a significant side effect of diphenhydramine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Nausea:**  Can be caused by any of the components.
* **Dizziness:** Especially likely with diphenhydramine.
* **Headache:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Blurred vision:**
* **Urinary retention:**  Less common but possible, especially in men with prostate problems.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including rash, hives, and difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

* **Diphenhydramine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  It also acts on the central nervous system to suppress coughs.
* **Ammonium Chloride & Terpin Hydrate:** Increase the fluid content of respiratory secretions, making the mucus thinner and easier to expel. This helps clear the airways.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a buffer to maintain the proper pH of the medication, preventing irritation to the stomach and improving the taste.
