# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol + Terpin Hydrate

**Generic Name:** Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol + Terpin Hydrate

**Usage:** This combination is used to temporarily relieve cough and congestion associated with the common cold or the flu.  Dextromethorphan hydrombromide is a cough suppressant (an antitussive), menthol provides a cooling sensation that can soothe irritated throat tissues, and terpin hydrate is an expectorant (though its effectiveness as such is debated).  It's typically used for a short duration, only as long as the symptoms persist.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of dextromethorphan.
* **Dizziness:** Especially when standing up quickly.
* **Nausea:**  Though less common.
* **Headache:**  Relatively infrequent.
* **Constipation:** A possible side effect of terpin hydrate.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions such as skin rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Stop use and seek medical attention if this happens.


**How it Works:**

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex. It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough, but it reduces the frequency of coughing fits.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation in the throat, providing temporary relief from irritation and potentially reducing the feeling of needing to cough.  It works locally, not systemically like the other ingredients.
* **Terpin Hydrate:**  Traditionally thought to help loosen mucus and make it easier to cough up (expectorant), but its effectiveness in this regard is not definitively proven by modern research. It may have a minor effect on increasing respiratory secretions.
