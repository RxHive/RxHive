# Digepepsin
### Generic Name
Digepepsin

### Usage
Digepepsin is a combination enzyme supplement containing bile salts, pancreatin, and pepsin.  Its primary use is to aid digestion in individuals with conditions that impair the pancreas's ability to produce sufficient digestive enzymes. This includes conditions such as chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder affecting multiple organs), pancreatic cancer, and post-pancreatic or gut surgery.  It's also used as a supplement for individuals experiencing indigestion or malabsorption due to insufficient enzyme production.  Essentially, Digepepsin helps the body break down food more effectively.

### Dosage
Dosage of Digepepsin varies considerably depending on the individual's condition, age, and the amount of fat consumed in their diet.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.

**Adult Dosage (for Pancreatic Insufficiency):**  The starting dose is typically 500 lipase units per kilogram of body weight per meal. The total daily dosage is adjusted to account for approximately 3 meals and 2-3 snacks.  Maximum daily dosage should not exceed 10,000 lipase units per kilogram of body weight or 4000 lipase units per gram of fat consumed daily.  The maximum dose per meal is 2500 lipase units/kg.

**Adult Dosage (for Chronic Pancreatitis or after Pancreatectomy):** A common starting dose is 72,000 lipase units per meal, particularly when consuming at least 100g of fat per day.

**Pediatric Dosage (for Pancreatic Insufficiency):**  For children over 4 years old, the dosage is generally the same as for adults. For children between 12 months and 4 years old, the starting dose is usually 1000 lipase units per kilogram of body weight per meal. Maximum daily dosage should not exceed 10,000 lipase units per kilogram of body weight or 4000 lipase units per gram of fat consumed daily. The maximum dose per meal is 2500 lipase units/kg.  Always consult a pediatrician for precise pediatric dosing.


**Administration:** Digepepsin is usually taken orally with meals or snacks.  Specific instructions regarding mixing with food or taking the capsules whole should be followed as per your doctor's advice.


### Side Effects

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, may also occur.  It is vital to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or unexpected side effects.

### How it Works
Digepepsin contains enzymes that aid in the digestion of food.  The pancreatin component contains amylase (breaks down carbohydrates), lipase (breaks down fats), and protease (breaks down proteins).  Pepsin also aids in protein digestion, and bile salts facilitate fat digestion and absorption. By supplementing these digestive enzymes, Digepepsin helps the body efficiently break down and absorb nutrients from food, alleviating symptoms related to insufficient enzyme production.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Digepepsin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any of its components, acute pancreatitis, or an acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of fibrosing colonopathy (a thickening and narrowing of the colon) progressing to colonic strictures and irritation/loss of enzyme activity from oral mucosa.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when administering the capsule contents directly or mixing them with food. Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Digepepsin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  Excretion in breast milk is also unknown.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Digepepsin without a doctor's prescription?** A:  No, Digepepsin should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional who can assess your specific needs and determine the appropriate dosage.

* **Q: How should I store Digepepsin?** A:  Store Digepepsin as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I take Digepepsin with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
