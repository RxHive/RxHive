# Didanosine
### Generic Name
Didanosine

### Usage

Didanosine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) primarily used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's not typically used as a monotherapy due to the rapid development of drug resistance.  The goal of using Didanosine in combination therapy is to suppress HIV replication and improve the immune system's ability to fight off the virus.


### Dosage

Didanosine dosage varies significantly depending on the formulation (powder for oral solution, delayed-release capsules), the patient's weight, and their renal function.  Precise dosage must be determined by a healthcare professional.  The information below should not be considered a prescription and is for informational purposes only.

**Adults (HIV Infection):**

* **Powder for Oral Solution:**  Patients weighing <60 kg may take 125 mg twice daily (BID) or 250 mg once daily (OD). Patients weighing ≥60 kg may take 200 mg BID or 400 mg OD.
* **Delayed-Release Capsules:** Dosage is weight-based: 200 mg OD (20-25kg), 250 mg OD (25-60kg), 400mg OD (≥60kg).

**Children (HIV Infection):**

Dosage is highly individualized and based on body surface area (mg/m²), age and weight.  It's crucial to follow the physician's specific instructions.  Generally, it involves twice-daily or once-daily dosing depending on the child's age and weight.  Maximum doses are determined by a healthcare professional.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment (reduced kidney function).  The dose needs to be reduced based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) values.  For patients with hepatic impairment (liver problems), dosage adjustment may not be necessary, but close monitoring is crucial.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in the extremities)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Increased amylase levels (an enzyme in the pancreas)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) – a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
* Lactic acidosis (buildup of lactic acid in the blood) –  a serious metabolic condition.
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) - inflammation that can occur as the immune system recovers.
* Severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (enlarged liver with fatty deposits)
* Renal failure


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Didanosine is a nucleoside analog that's converted into its active form, didanosine triphosphate, inside cells.  This active form inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial for the virus to replicate its genetic material (RNA into DNA). By inhibiting this enzyme, Didanosine prevents the virus from making copies of itself, slowing its progression and reducing the viral load in the body.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Didanosine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, as well as with concurrent use of stavudine, allopurinol, or ribavirin.
* **Drug Interactions:** Didanosine can interact with numerous other drugs, including some antiretrovirals, allopurinol, ganciclovir, ribavirin, tenofovir, quinolones, tetracyclines, and indinavir.  These interactions can either increase the effectiveness or toxicity of Didanosine or other medications. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your healthcare provider before starting Didanosine.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Didanosine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B, but its use in pregnancy is generally avoided due to the potential for toxicity.  Its use during breastfeeding is not recommended as its excretion into breast milk is unknown.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Close monitoring is needed for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Dosage adjustments may be required.
* **Pancreatitis and Lactic Acidosis:**  Didanosine carries a boxed warning for pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, both serious and potentially fatal conditions.  Regular monitoring is necessary to detect these complications early.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Didanosine?** A: Store Didanosine according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I take Didanosine with food?** A: It depends on the formulation. Some formulations (powder for solution) should be taken on an empty stomach, while others may be taken with food. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q: How long will I need to take Didanosine?** A: Treatment duration is determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to therapy.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking Didanosine?** A:  Long-term use of Didanosine can lead to several side effects, including peripheral neuropathy and potential organ damage. Regular monitoring is critical to assess these risks.
