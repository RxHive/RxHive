# Didanosine

**Generic Name:** Didanosine (ddI)

**Usage:** Didanosine is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection. It's often used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  It's also sometimes used to treat Hepatitis B.  It's important to note that didanosine is *not* a cure for HIV or Hepatitis B; it helps to manage the infection and slow its progression.  The specific dosage and regimen will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and other medications being taken.

**Side Effects:** Didanosine can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others severe. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal problems:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas – a serious side effect)
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet. This can be debilitating.
* **Headache**
* **Fatigue**
* **Rash**
* **Muscle pain**
* **Elevated liver enzymes** (indicating potential liver damage)
* **Kidney problems** (rare but serious)

Severe side effects, though less common, can include:

* **Pancreatitis:** This is a serious and potentially life-threatening side effect requiring immediate medical attention. Symptoms can include severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** In severe cases, this can lead to significant disability.
* **Lactic acidosis:** A buildup of lactic acid in the blood, which can be fatal.


**How it Works:** Didanosine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).  It works by interfering with the action of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV needs to replicate its genetic material.  By inhibiting reverse transcriptase, didanosine prevents HIV from making copies of itself, thus slowing the progression of the infection.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take didanosine with food?** A: Yes, didanosine is typically taken with food to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.  However, specific instructions should be followed as provided by a doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q: What are the drug interactions with didanosine?** A: Didanosine can interact with many other medications, including other antiretroviral drugs, antacids, and certain antibiotics. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Taking didanosine with dofetilide is contraindicated.
* **Q: How is didanosine administered?** A: Didanosine is available in tablet and powder forms. The specific administration method will depend on the formulation and the doctor's prescription.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Don't try to catch up on missed doses.  Follow your doctor’s instructions on what to do if you miss a dose.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of didanosine?** A: Long-term use of didanosine can increase the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy, lactic acidosis, and other side effects. Regular monitoring by a doctor is essential.
* **Q: Is didanosine still used?** A: While newer antiretroviral medications are often preferred, didanosine remains an option, particularly in certain situations or for individuals who cannot tolerate other medications.  Its use is largely determined by treatment guidelines and individual patient needs in consultation with a physician.
