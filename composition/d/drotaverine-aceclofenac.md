**How it Works:**

* **Drotaverine:** This is a smooth muscle relaxant. It works by relaxing the muscles in the walls of blood vessels and other organs, helping to relieve pain and spasms, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract and biliary system. Its role in this combination is primarily to manage the pain component.

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  It addresses the inflammatory component of the pain.


The combination of these two drugs provides a synergistic effect, offering relief from both the pain and the inflammation contributing to the condition.
