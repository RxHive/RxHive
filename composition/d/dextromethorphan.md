# Dextromethorphan
### Generic Name
Dextromethorphan

### Usage
Dextromethorphan is primarily used as an antitussive, meaning it suppresses coughs.  It's effective in temporarily controlling coughs caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation, often associated with the common cold or exposure to inhaled irritants.  Extended-release formulations are also used to help manage the cough impulse, thereby improving sleep for individuals experiencing disruptive nighttime coughs.  It's important to note that dextromethorphan does not treat the underlying cause of the cough; it only manages the symptom.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Cough suppressant (immediate-release):** 10-20 mg every 4 hours, or 20-30 mg every 6-8 hours, as needed.  Do not exceed the maximum daily dose as recommended by your doctor or as indicated on the packaging.
* **Cough suppressant (extended-release):** 60 mg twice daily (BID), with a maximum daily dose of 120 mg.

**Children:**  Dosage varies significantly based on age and formulation. Always follow the specific instructions on the product label or consult your pediatrician for accurate dosage information.  Examples include:

* **Immediate-release syrup:** Dosages range from 5 mg every 4 hours for children aged 2 to under 6 years, to 10 mg every 4 hours for children aged 6 to under 12 years, and 20 mg every 4 hours for children 12 years and older. The maximum daily dose is usually limited.
* **Long-acting liquid or capsules:** Dosages are generally higher but administered less frequently. Again, always check the product label for exact directions.
* **Extended-release suspension:** Dosage varies by age and is typically given every 12 hours. Consult your pediatrician or the product label for precise instructions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's label may not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your kidney or liver function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and can include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nervousness
* Restlessness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Gastrointestinal distress

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Dextromethorphan is structurally similar to codeine. It works by decreasing the sensitivity of the cough receptors in the body and interfering with the transmission of the cough impulse to the brain. This action is primarily mediated through the stimulation of sigma receptors in the medullary cough center, a region of the brainstem involved in initiating coughs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use dextromethorphan if you are currently taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or have taken one within the past two weeks.  This combination can lead to a potentially dangerous interaction.
* **Interactions:** Dextromethorphan can interact with many medications, including certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, and other cough suppressants.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting dextromethorphan.  The levels of dextromethorphan in your system can also be affected by certain medications.
* **Increased Risk:** Dextromethorphan may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, when used with other serotonergic medications.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients who are sedated, debilitated, or confined to bed rest.  It should also be used cautiously in children with atopic conditions (e.g., asthma, eczema) and individuals identified as poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, an enzyme involved in drug metabolism.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered acceptable at standard doses during pregnancy (Category C), always consult your doctor before using dextromethorphan if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The extent of dextromethorphan excretion in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dextromethorphan with alcohol?** A:  Combining dextromethorphan with alcohol is generally not recommended as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.
* **Q: How should I store dextromethorphan?** A: Store dextromethorphan at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and out of reach of children.  Always follow the storage instructions on the product label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: Is dextromethorphan habit-forming?** A: At therapeutic doses, dextromethorphan is not considered habit-forming. However, misuse or abuse at high doses can lead to dependence.
* **Q: How long can I take dextromethorphan?** A:  Do not use dextromethorphan for longer than recommended by your doctor or as indicated on the product label. If your cough persists or worsens after a few days, consult your healthcare provider.
