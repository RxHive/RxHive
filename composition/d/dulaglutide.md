# Dulaglutide

**Generic Name:** Dulaglutide

**Usage:** Dulaglutide is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It may be used alone or with other diabetes medications.  It is also used to reduce major cardiovascular events (like heart attack, stroke, or death) in adults with type 2 diabetes who already have established cardiovascular disease.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, swelling, itching at the injection site.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  This is a serious, but rare side effect.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain.
* **Gallbladder problems:**  Increased risk of gallstones.
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of existing kidney disease.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** More likely if used with other diabetes medications, especially insulin or sulfonylureas.  Symptoms include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion.
* **Weight loss:** While often desirable in type 2 diabetes, significant weight loss can have negative health consequences if not managed.


**How it Works:** Dulaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.  It works in several ways to lower blood sugar:

* **Increases insulin release:**  Stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin when blood sugar is high.
* **Decreases glucagon secretion:** Reduces the amount of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar, from the pancreas.
* **Slows gastric emptying:** Delays the emptying of the stomach, leading to a slower rise in blood sugar after meals.
* **May promote weight loss:** Can lead to some weight loss by increasing satiety (feeling full).


**FAQs:**

* **How is it administered?** Dulaglutide is administered by injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) once weekly.
* **Can I take it with other medications?**  Yes, it can be used with other diabetes medications, but your doctor will need to monitor you closely for potential interactions, especially with insulin or sulfonylureas.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Inject the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe side effects, particularly pancreatitis or severe allergic reactions. For less severe side effects, discuss them with your doctor to determine if adjustments are needed or if the side effects will subside.
* **Is dulaglutide right for me?** Only your doctor can determine if dulaglutide is the appropriate treatment for your specific situation based on your medical history, other health conditions, and current medications.
