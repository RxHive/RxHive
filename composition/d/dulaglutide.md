# Dulaglutide
### Generic Name
Dulaglutide

### Usage

Dulaglutide is a medication primarily used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's administered as an add-on to diet and exercise.  A key benefit is its ability to also reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (like heart attack or stroke) in adults with type 2 diabetes who already have heart disease or multiple risk factors for heart disease.  It's crucial to understand that dulaglutide is *not* used to treat type 1 diabetes.  Furthermore, it's not recommended for individuals with severe gastrointestinal (GI) problems, such as severe gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying).

### Dosage

**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes):** Dulaglutide is given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection once weekly.  The starting dose is typically 0.75 mg.  Your doctor may increase this to 1.5 mg, then 3 mg, and finally, if needed, to a maximum of 4.5 mg,  depending on your blood sugar levels and response to treatment.  Each dose increase should be made after at least four weeks on the previous dose. If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible if there are at least 3 days until the next scheduled dose. If less than 3 days remain, the missed dose should be skipped.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of dulaglutide haven't been established in children under 18 years old.  It's not recommended for use in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dose adjustments are usually needed for people with liver problems. However, caution is advised. For those with kidney problems, adjustments generally aren't necessary, but caution should be exercised, especially when starting or increasing the dose.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (more than 10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) â€“ especially when combined with insulin or certain other diabetes medications.  Severe hypoglycemia is also possible, particularly if using prandial (mealtime) insulin concurrently.

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (1-10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Prolonged PR interval on ECG (a heart rhythm abnormality)
* First-degree atrioventricular block (a heart conduction delay)
* Sustained tachycardia (prolonged fast heart rate)
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Constipation
* Flatulence
* Antibody development


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1% or post-marketing reports):**

* Acute renal failure (kidney failure)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Chronic renal failure (worsening of kidney disease)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Increased serum amylase and lipase levels (indicative of potential pancreatitis)
* Injection site reactions
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Dulaglutide works by mimicking a natural hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1). GLP-1 helps your body release insulin when your blood sugar is high and it also reduces the amount of glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar) your body produces.  This helps to lower blood sugar levels and improve blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. It also slows down how quickly your stomach empties, potentially helping to manage blood sugar levels after meals.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** Dulaglutide is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2).
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of cardiovascular effects (like changes in heart rate and rhythm), serious allergic reactions, pancreatitis, thyroid C-cell tumors, gallbladder and bile duct problems, hypoglycemia, acute kidney injury, and worsening of diabetic retinopathy.
* **Use with Caution:**  Caution is advised in patients with or at risk of developing conduction abnormalities of the heart, a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis to other GLP-1 receptor agonists, liver impairment, or kidney impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Dulaglutide is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  Other diabetes medications are generally preferred during pregnancy. The decision to breastfeed while using dulaglutide should be made carefully, considering the potential for the drug to pass into breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dulaglutide can interact with other medications.  Discuss all your current medications with your doctor before starting dulaglutide.

**Boxed Warning:** There is an increased risk of thyroid C-cell tumors in animals exposed to dulaglutide. While the relevance to humans is unknown,  patients should be aware of this potential risk and report any neck masses or related symptoms to their physician immediately.


### FAQs

* **Q: How do I store dulaglutide?** A: Store dulaglutide in the refrigerator.  Do not freeze.

* **Q: Can I take dulaglutide with other medications?** A:  You should discuss all your medications with your doctor to ensure there are no harmful interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Refer to the dosage section for instructions on missed doses.

* **Q:  What are the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?** A: Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, and hunger.  If you experience these symptoms, check your blood sugar level and take appropriate action, like consuming a fast-acting carbohydrate.

* **Q: How is dulaglutide injected?** A: It's injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.  Rotate injection sites to prevent irritation.

* **Q: Is dulaglutide safe for everyone with type 2 diabetes?** A: No, dulaglutide is not appropriate for everyone with type 2 diabetes.  Your doctor will assess your individual health condition to determine suitability.  It should not be used with type 1 diabetes, and individuals with severe GI conditions are typically not candidates for the medication.
