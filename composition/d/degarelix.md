# Degarelix

**Generic Name:** Degarelix

**Usage:** Degarelix is used to treat advanced prostate cancer.  Specifically, it's used to reduce levels of testosterone in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic prostate cancer) or is considered high-risk for spreading.  It may be used alone or in combination with other treatments.  It is administered by injection.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, degarelix can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, swelling, or bruising at the injection site.
* **Increased risk of hot flashes:**  A common side effect due to decreased testosterone levels.
* **Increased risk of gynecomastia (breast enlargement):** Due to decreased testosterone levels.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired.
* **Pain in bones:**  This is sometimes related to the underlying prostate cancer.
* **Decreased libido (sex drive):** A common side effect due to decreased testosterone levels.
* **Erectile dysfunction:** Difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection.


**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild skin rashes to severe, life-threatening reactions. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* **Thromboembolic events (blood clots):**  This is a rare but serious side effect.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or leg pain.


This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:** Degarelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of GnRH, a hormone that stimulates the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  LH is crucial for the testes to produce testosterone. By blocking GnRH, degarelix effectively reduces testosterone production, which can help slow or stop the growth of prostate cancer cells that depend on testosterone for growth.
