# Degarelix
### Generic Name
Degarelix

### Usage
Degarelix is primarily used to treat advanced prostate cancer.  It works by suppressing testosterone production, which is crucial in the growth of many prostate cancers. This suppression is achieved through its action as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist. While its primary use is in advanced prostate cancer, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other conditions involving hormonal imbalances.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Prostate Cancer):** Degarelix is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  The typical regimen involves a loading dose of 240 mg (given as two 120 mg injections) followed by a maintenance dose of 80 mg every 28 days, starting 28 days after the loading dose.  Each injection is administered deep subcutaneously into the abdomen, and injection sites should be rotated.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Degarelix in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** For patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B), no dosage adjustment is typically needed, but serum testosterone levels should be monitored closely.  For those with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) or renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min),  the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments; therefore, use should be cautious and under close medical supervision.  

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Hot flashes
* Increased levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase (a liver enzyme)
* Increased levels of transaminases (liver enzymes)
* Injection site reactions (erythema, induration, nodule, pain, swelling)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Chills
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Hypertension
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men)
* Weight gain
* Erectile dysfunction
* Testicular atrophy
* Urinary tract infection
* Antibody development
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Back pain
* Fever
* Night sweats


**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**

* QT prolongation on electrocardiogram (ECG) – this is a serious potential side effect that requires monitoring.

**Post-Marketing Reports:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, urticaria, and angioedema).


If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works
Degarelix is a GnRH receptor antagonist.  GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) is a natural hormone that stimulates the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH are essential for testosterone production in men. By blocking the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, Degarelix prevents the release of LH and FSH, thus significantly reducing testosterone production. The resulting decrease in testosterone levels helps slow or stop the growth of testosterone-dependent prostate cancers.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Degarelix is contraindicated in patients with a known history of severe hypersensitivity to Degarelix or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings:** Degarelix use is associated with an increased risk of developing anemia, decreased bone mineral density, hypersensitivity reactions, QT prolongation, cardiovascular diseases, insulin resistance and diabetes, and embryo-fetal toxicity.  It's crucial to monitor for these potential complications during treatment.

**Use with Caution:**  Degarelix should be used cautiously in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, a history of QT prolongation, or other risk factors for QT prolongation (e.g., concomitant use of QT-prolonging medications).  It should also be used cautiously in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Drug Interactions:** Degarelix can interact with other medications, particularly those that prolong the QT interval on the ECG.  Concomitant use with certain drugs like hydroxychloroquine, donepezil, citalopram, ribociclib, pitolisant, zuclopenthixol, sotalol, hydroxyzine, amiodarone, vemurafenib, and pimavanserin may increase the risk of QT prolongation. Consult a healthcare provider about potential drug interactions before starting Degarelix.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Degarelix is categorized as pregnancy category X, meaning it poses a significant risk of fetal harm.  It should not be used during pregnancy.  The excretion of Degarelix in breast milk is unknown; therefore, a decision on whether to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug should be made carefully, considering the benefits and risks involved.

### FAQs
**Q: How is Degarelix stored?**
A: Degarelix should be stored in the refrigerator between 2°C and 8°C (36°F and 46°F).  Protect it from light.

**Q: How long does it take for Degarelix to work?**
A: The effects of Degarelix typically become apparent within a few weeks of starting treatment, but the full therapeutic effect may take longer to achieve. Regular monitoring of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels is crucial to assess treatment response.

**Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Degarelix?**
A: There's no specific contraindication against alcohol consumption while on Degarelix, but excessive alcohol intake should be avoided, as it can impact overall health and potentially interfere with the treatment's effectiveness.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss the appropriate course of action. Do not attempt to double up on doses.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with Degarelix?**
A:  Long-term use of Degarelix can be associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteoporosis), increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disturbances (diabetes), and possible impacts on fertility. Regular monitoring and supplemental calcium and vitamin D might mitigate some of these risks.  Your doctor should regularly discuss any long-term concerns with you.
