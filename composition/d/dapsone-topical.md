# Dapsone (Topical)
### Generic Name
Dapsone (Topical)

### Usage
Dapsone topical is primarily used to treat acne vulgaris, a common skin condition characterized by pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads.  It's a topical antimicrobial agent, meaning it works directly on the skin to fight bacteria implicated in acne.  Currently, it's not approved for other conditions, though further research may reveal additional uses.

### Dosage

**Acne Vulgaris:**

* **Adults and Adolescents (≥12 years):**
    * **5% Gel:** Apply a pea-sized amount to the affected area twice daily (BID).  Re-evaluate treatment after 12 weeks if no improvement is seen.
    * **7.5% Gel:** Apply a pea-sized amount in a thin layer to the entire face and affected areas once daily (OD). Re-evaluate treatment after 12 weeks if no improvement is seen.
* **Children (≥9 years):**  The dosage for 5% gel is the same as for adults.  Use of 7.5% gel in children under 12 years of age is not explicitly addressed in current labeling and should be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, it's crucial to consult a doctor before using this medication if you have liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include: application site reactions (such as redness, dryness, or irritation), abdominal pain, and facial edema.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:  Depression, psychosis, pancreatitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, vomiting, tonic-clonic movements, and suicide attempts have been reported.  These are rare, but it's vital to seek immediate medical attention if any of these occur.  

**Important Note:** This list does not include all possible side effects.  If you experience any unusual symptoms, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
Dapsone works by competitively inhibiting para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a vital component in the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria that contribute to acne. By blocking PABA, dapsone disrupts bacterial folic acid production, hindering bacterial growth and reducing acne lesions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Increased Risk:** Dapsone can increase the risk of methemoglobinemia (a condition where the blood's ability to carry oxygen is reduced), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), and skin reactions.
* **Use with Caution:**  Dapsone should be used cautiously in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as it can trigger hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells) in these individuals.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dapsone may interact with several medications, including antimalarials, benzoyl peroxide, trimethoprim, and agents associated with methemoglobinemia. Avoid concurrent use without consulting your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dapsone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, and only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised if breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use other acne treatments with dapsone?** A:  No, avoid using other topical acne treatments such as benzoyl peroxide concurrently without your doctor's explicit guidance.  Combined use can increase the risk of side effects.
