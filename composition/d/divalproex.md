# Divalproex
### Generic Name
Divalproex Sodium

### Usage
Divalproex sodium is primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.  

**Epilepsy:** It's effective in controlling various types of seizures, including tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and atonic seizures. It can be used alone or in combination with other anti-seizure medications.

**Bipolar Disorder:** Divalproex sodium helps manage manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, reducing symptoms like excessive energy, impulsivity, and irritability.  It's often used as part of a broader treatment plan that may include other mood stabilizers or therapies.

While less common, it may also be used off-label for migraine prophylaxis (prevention) in certain individuals.  However, this use should only be considered under the direct supervision of a physician.


### Dosage

Divalproex sodium dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors including the patient's age, weight, specific condition being treated, and response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Oral Administration:**  Dosages are typically started low and gradually increased until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved while carefully monitoring for side effects.  The medication is available in tablets, capsules, and oral solutions (syrups).  

* **Adults (Epilepsy & Bipolar Disorder):**  Initial doses may range from 250-500mg twice daily, adjusted as needed under medical supervision.  Maximum daily doses vary widely depending on the condition and individual response.

* **Children (Epilepsy):** Dosages are calculated based on weight and are significantly lower than adult doses.  A doctor will determine the appropriate starting dose and adjustment schedule.


**Intravenous (IV) Administration:** IV divalproex is generally reserved for situations where oral administration is not feasible, such as in severe seizure emergencies or when a patient is unable to take medication orally.  IV administration is strictly under the supervision of a healthcare professional in a hospital or clinical setting.  Dosage and administration rates are precisely controlled.


**Important Note:**  Never adjust your dosage or stop taking divalproex without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to serious consequences.

### How it Works

The exact mechanism of action of divalproex sodium isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work through multiple pathways in the brain. It affects the levels of several neurotransmitters, including GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps regulate nerve activity. By increasing GABA levels, divalproex helps to reduce the excitability of neurons, thus controlling seizures and stabilizing mood. It also impacts other neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation and seizure activity.



### Precautions

* **Liver Function:** Divalproex can affect liver function.  Regular blood tests are necessary, especially during initial treatment and in children.
* **Pregnancy:**  Divalproex is associated with a risk of birth defects, including neural tube defects.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks, and under close medical supervision.
* **Interactions:** Divalproex can interact with many other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Blood Disorders:** Divalproex can affect platelet function, increasing bleeding risk.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking divalproex, as it can exacerbate side effects.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of divalproex and require lower doses.
