# Diclofenac + Codeine
### Generic Name
Diclofenac + Codeine

### Usage

Diclofenac + Codeine is a combination medication used to relieve moderate to severe pain, particularly pain associated with inflammation.  The diclofenac component is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing inflammation and pain. Codeine is an opioid analgesic that acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. This combination is often prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Post-surgical pain:**  Managing pain after operations or procedures.
* **Acute musculoskeletal pain:** Relieving pain from injuries like sprains, strains, and fractures.
* **Dental pain:**  Alleviating pain associated with dental procedures or oral infections (when appropriate).
* **Severe menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea):**  Providing pain relief during periods.
* **Other conditions causing moderate to severe pain:** In some cases, a physician might prescribe this combination for other sources of severe pain, but this is less common and requires careful consideration of the risks and benefits.

It's crucial to understand that this is not a first-line treatment for all types of pain.  Its use should be guided by a healthcare professional, considering the potential risks associated with opioid use.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (tablet, capsule), the severity of pain, and the individual patient's response.  **It's absolutely essential to follow your doctor's prescription exactly.**  Never adjust the dosage yourself.

**There is no universally applicable dosage for adults or children.**  Dosage instructions will be provided on your prescription label and should be followed carefully. Pediatric use of this combination is generally discouraged due to the potential risks associated with codeine in children.  Safe and effective alternatives are usually preferred for pediatric pain management.

**Oral Administration:**  The typical regimen often involves taking one or two tablets or capsules at a time, several times a day (e.g., every 4-6 hours), as directed by your doctor. Never exceed the recommended dose.

**IV Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously. Diclofenac and codeine are usually given orally.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Diclofenac inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever. Codeine binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, altering the perception of pain and causing analgesia (pain relief).  The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects, making it effective for moderate to severe pain associated with inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not take this medication if you are allergic to diclofenac, codeine, or any of the inactive ingredients.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This combination should generally be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the baby.  Consult your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** This medication should be used with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  This combination can interact with many other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), other NSAIDs, and certain antidepressants.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol while taking this medication as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients are more susceptible to side effects from this medication and may require lower doses.
* **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for children due to the risks associated with codeine.
