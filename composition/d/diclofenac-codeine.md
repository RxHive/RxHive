# Diclofenac + Codeine

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Codeine (various combinations exist, e.g., Diclofenac sodium + Codeine phosphate)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve moderate to severe pain, particularly pain associated with inflammation.  It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* Post-surgical pain
* Post-traumatic pain (e.g., after a fracture or sprain)
* Dental pain
* Severe menstrual cramps
* Other types of inflammatory pain unresponsive to other analgesics


**Side Effects:**  The side effects can be significant and vary depending on the dose and individual sensitivity.  They include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, stomach upset, heartburn
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased risk of bleeding (especially in those with ulcers or blood clotting disorders), liver damage (jaundice, dark urine), kidney damage, allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), dependence (with prolonged codeine use), confusion, respiratory depression (especially with higher doses or in individuals with respiratory conditions),  constipation leading to bowel obstruction.
* **Rare but Severe:** Anaphylaxis, seizures.


**How it Works:** This medication combines two different pain-relieving mechanisms:

* **Diclofenac:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Codeine:** An opioid analgesic. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain.  Codeine is a weaker opioid than morphine, but it still carries the risk of dependence and other side effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this medication addictive?** Codeine is an opioid and carries a risk of dependence with prolonged use.  It's crucial to take it only as prescribed and for the duration specified by the doctor.  Stopping abruptly after prolonged use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  No.  Combining alcohol with this medication can significantly increase the risk of liver damage, stomach upset, bleeding, and drowsiness. It can also worsen the risk of respiratory depression.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Instead, take the next dose as scheduled.

* **What are the precautions?** This medication should be used with caution in individuals with a history of liver or kidney disease, bleeding disorders, ulcers, asthma, or respiratory problems.  It's not suitable for everyone. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking it.

* **What are the interactions?** This medication can interact with many other drugs, including other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (blood thinners), and certain antidepressants. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **How long can I take this medication?** The duration of treatment will depend on your condition and response to treatment.  It should not be used long-term without careful monitoring by a doctor.
