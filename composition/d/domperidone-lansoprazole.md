# Domperidone + Lansoprazole
### Generic Name
Domperidone + Lansoprazole


### Usage

Domperidone and Lansoprazole combination is primarily used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, particularly those involving both acid reflux and impaired gastric motility.  Lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), reduces stomach acid production, addressing the burning sensation and heartburn associated with GERD. Domperidone, a dopamine antagonist, helps improve the movement of food through the digestive tract, alleviating symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and bloating often linked to slow stomach emptying. This combination targets both the acid component and the motility issues frequently seen in GERD and other functional dyspepsia conditions.  While not typically a first-line treatment for peptic ulcers, this combination may be used in certain cases where both acid suppression and improved gastric emptying are deemed beneficial.  Always consult a physician to determine if this combination is the right treatment for your specific condition.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary based on individual patient needs and the prescribing physician's judgment.  There isn't a universally standardized formulation; the specific dosages of Domperidone and Lansoprazole will be determined by the brand and formulation of the combined medication prescribed.  Therefore, it's crucial to follow the instructions precisely as printed on your prescription label or as directed by your doctor.  

**Generally:**  Dosages are usually determined based on the severity of symptoms and patient response.  This information is for general knowledge and should not be taken as medical advice; always follow the directions provided by your doctor.  The medication should *never* be taken without a doctor's prescription.  Children's dosage is not generally established for this particular combination and should only be administered under strict physician supervision. The use in pregnancy and breastfeeding should also be determined by a doctor, weighing the benefits against potential risks.


**Oral Administration:**  The combination is typically administered orally, usually once or twice daily, with or without food, depending on the specific product and physician's instructions.

**IV Administration:**  This combination is *not* typically administered intravenously (IV).  Domperidone and Lansoprazole are usually administered orally.

**Important Note:**  Never alter the prescribed dosage without consulting your physician.  Incorrect dosage can lead to ineffective treatment or adverse effects.

### How it Works

Lansoprazole inhibits the proton pump in the stomach's parietal cells, significantly reducing the secretion of gastric acid. This lowers stomach acidity, alleviating symptoms like heartburn and acid reflux. Domperidone acts as a dopamine antagonist, blocking the action of dopamine in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. This effect enhances gastric motility (the movement of food through the stomach and intestines), relieving symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and bloating often associated with slow gastric emptying.  The combined effect of reduced acid and improved motility addresses the dual nature of symptoms experienced by many patients with GERD and related conditions.
