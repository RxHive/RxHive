# Dexamfetamine
### Generic Name
Dexamfetamine

### Usage
Dexamfetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used to treat two distinct conditions:

* **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):**  Dexamfetamine helps improve focus, attention span, and reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity in children and adults with ADHD. It's considered part of a broader treatment plan that often includes behavioral therapy and educational interventions.

* **Narcolepsy:** This medication combats excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness) associated with narcolepsy.  It promotes wakefulness and improves alertness.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on factors like age, weight, response to treatment, and the presence of other medical conditions.  The information below is for general understanding and should not be used for self-medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Narcolepsy:**  Oral administration.  Typically starts at 10 mg once daily (OD), gradually increasing in 10 mg increments at intervals of at least one week, as tolerated. The usual daily dose ranges from 5-60 mg, either once daily or in divided doses (with at least 4-6 hours between doses).  Elderly patients may start with a lower dose (5 mg/day).

* **ADHD:** Oral administration. Dosage varies depending on formulation (immediate-release or extended-release).  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage and frequency.

**Children:**

Dosage for children varies significantly based on age, weight, and the specific condition being treated (ADHD or narcolepsy).  Immediate-release and extended-release formulations exist, each with specific dosing instructions.  A doctor will carefully monitor the child's response and adjust the dosage accordingly.  For both ADHD and narcolepsy, the initial dose is typically lower in younger children and gradually increased as needed.  Always consult a pediatrician for accurate dosage information.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Decreased appetite
* Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
* Headaches
* Irritability
* Stomach upset (nausea, vomiting)

Less common but serious side effects may include:

If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and immediately contact your doctor or seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Dexamfetamine is a stimulant that primarily increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. These neurotransmitters play crucial roles in attention, focus, and wakefulness. By increasing their availability, dexamfetamine helps improve concentration, reduce hyperactivity, and combat excessive sleepiness. The exact mechanism by which it improves ADHD symptoms is still being researched.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dexamfetamine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication, severe cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or those currently taking or recently discontinued monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  It should also be avoided in individuals with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

* **Drug Interactions:** Dexamfetamine can interact with numerous other medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  Particular attention should be paid to interactions with MAOIs, other stimulants, and certain antidepressants.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Dexamfetamine is categorized as a pregnancy Category C drug.  Its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks to the fetus.  It's generally not recommended during breastfeeding due to its excretion in breast milk.

* **Other Precautions:**  Individuals with a history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or epilepsy should exercise caution when taking dexamfetamine. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is often recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking dexamfetamine suddenly?** A: No, sudden cessation, especially after prolonged use or high doses, can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment to develop a safe tapering-off plan.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking dexamfetamine?** A:  It's advised to avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you. Dexamfetamine can cause dizziness and impaired judgment.

* **Q: How should I store dexamfetamine?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets.
