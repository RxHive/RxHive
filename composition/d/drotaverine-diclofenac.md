# Drotaverine + Diclofenac

**Generic Name:** Drotaverine + Diclofenac

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve pain and spasms, particularly in conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract, biliary tract, or urinary tract.  Specific conditions it might be used for include:

* Renal colic (kidney stones)
* Biliary colic (gallstones)
* Abdominal pain associated with dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps)
* Pain and spasms associated with gastrointestinal disorders.

**Note:**  The specific usage may vary depending on the formulation and the prescribing physician's judgment.  This is not an exhaustive list and should not be used for self-medication. Always consult a doctor before taking this medication.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivities and dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia (indigestion).  Diclofenac, being an NSAID, carries a risk of more serious gastrointestinal complications like ulcers and bleeding, though this is less common with lower doses and shorter treatment durations.
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term or high-dose use of Diclofenac).  This risk is more significant in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or risk factors.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a rare but serious reaction requiring immediate medical attention).
* **Renal:**  In rare cases, kidney problems.
* **Hepatic:**  In rare cases, liver problems.


**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Drotaverine:** This is a spasmolytic, meaning it relaxes smooth muscles in the body, particularly in the gastrointestinal, biliary, and urinary tracts. This helps to relieve spasms and pain associated with muscle contractions.

The combination of Diclofenac and Drotaverine provides both pain relief (Diclofenac) and spasm relief (Drotaverine), making it effective for conditions involving both pain and muscle spasms.
