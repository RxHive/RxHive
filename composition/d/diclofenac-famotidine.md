# Diclofenac + Famotidine
### Generic Name
Diclofenac + Famotidine

### Usage

Diclofenac + Famotidine is a combination medication used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis (types of inflammatory arthritis).  It combines two active ingredients: diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation, and famotidine, an H2-receptor antagonist that reduces stomach acid production.  The famotidine is included to help protect the stomach lining from the potential irritation caused by diclofenac, a common side effect of NSAIDs.  This combination is primarily used for the treatment of arthritis pain where the pain relief offered by diclofenac is desired, but the risk of stomach upset is a concern. It's crucial to understand that this combination *treats symptoms*, not the underlying cause of the arthritis.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific formulation (tablet strength, etc.) prescribed by a doctor. **Never adjust your dosage without consulting your physician.**  This information is for general understanding only and does not replace a doctor's prescription and instructions.

* **Oral:**  The dosage will be indicated on your prescription.  It typically involves taking one or two tablets or capsules daily, at specific times, often with food to minimize stomach upset. The exact dosage and frequency will depend on your individual needs and the severity of your condition.
* **IV (Intravenous):** Diclofenac + Famotidine combination is *not* typically available as an IV formulation.  Diclofenac and famotidine may be administered intravenously *separately* in certain hospital settings, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision.


**Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for use in children.  Diclofenac and famotidine may be used separately in children under strict medical supervision, but the combination is not usually prescribed.

**Adults:** Dosage for adults is determined by the physician based on factors such as the severity of the condition, patient response, and potential side effects.

* Upset stomach

**If you experience any serious side effects or those not listed here, seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Diclofenac works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation. By reducing these, it alleviates pain and swelling associated with arthritis. Famotidine works by blocking histamine receptors in the stomach, which reduces the production of stomach acid.  This protective effect lessens the likelihood of ulcers and stomach upset often associated with diclofenac use.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, that you are taking. Diclofenac and famotidine can interact with some medications.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of stomach irritation and bleeding.
* **Elderly:** Elderly individuals are more susceptible to side effects, so careful monitoring and potentially lower dosage may be necessary.
