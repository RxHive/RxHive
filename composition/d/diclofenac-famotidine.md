# Diclofenac + Famotidine

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Famotidine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation (swelling) associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Famotidine is an H2 blocker that reduces stomach acid production. The famotidine is included to help protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of diclofenac. This combination is prescribed when the benefits of pain and inflammation relief outweigh the risks of stomach upset.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and duration as directed by a physician.  This medication is not a cure for arthritis but helps manage symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **From Diclofenac:**  Headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, dizziness, drowsiness, fluid retention.  More serious but less common side effects include:  Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, kidney problems, liver problems, stomach ulcers, bleeding, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* **From Famotidine:** Headache, diarrhea, constipation.  Rarely, more serious side effects like liver problems or allergic reactions can occur.

**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:**  Inhibits the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin levels, diclofenac alleviates pain and reduces swelling.
* **Famotidine:** Reduces the amount of acid produced by the stomach. This protective effect lessens the risk of ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems often associated with long-term NSAID use.  The reduced acid also helps alleviate some of the potential gastrointestinal side effects of diclofenac.
