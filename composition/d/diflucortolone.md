# Diflucortolone
### Generic Name
Diflucortolone

### Usage
Diflucortolone is a potent topical corticosteroid used to treat various acute and chronic inflammatory skin conditions. Its primary use is to reduce inflammation, itching, and redness associated with dermatological issues.  Secondary uses may include managing conditions like eczema (atopic dermatitis), psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin diseases.  It's important to remember that Diflucortolone is only for external use on the skin and should not be ingested.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Dosage varies depending on the formulation (cream or ointment) and the severity of the condition.

* **Cream (0.1%):** A thin layer should be applied to the affected area one to two times daily.  Treatment should not exceed four weeks. If no improvement or worsening is seen after 2-4 weeks, consult a doctor.
* **Ointment/Oily Cream (0.3%):** Initially, apply a thin layer twice daily (BID). Once improvement is seen, reduce to once daily (OD). The maximum weekly dose is 60g, and treatment should not exceed two weeks.


**Children:**

* **Children >1 year and adolescents:**  The dosage for cream (0.1%) is the same as for adults.
* **Children â‰¥5 years and adolescents:** The dosage for oily cream/ointment (0.3%) is the same as for adults.  Diflucortolone is generally not recommended for infants under 1 year of age, and its use in younger children should be under strict medical supervision.  

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment; however, the shortest duration and lowest effective dose should always be used.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Application site irritation (burning, redness)
* Skin thinning (atrophy)
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Acne-like eruptions
* Increased hair growth (hypertrichosis)
* Allergic contact dermatitis

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
* Increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
* Osteoporosis (bone thinning)
* Cataracts or glaucoma (with prolonged use near the eyes)
* Secondary skin infections (due to immunosuppression)

If any side effects occur, especially serious ones, consult a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Diflucortolone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the skin. It inhibits the release of inflammatory substances, like histamine and prostaglandins, thus decreasing redness, swelling, itching, and other inflammatory responses.  Its precise mechanism involves binding to intracellular receptors, influencing gene expression, and suppressing the inflammatory cascade.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Diflucortolone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or other corticosteroids, infants under 1 year of age, viral or fungal skin infections, tuberculosis or syphilis of the skin, rosacea, pruritus without inflammation, perianal and genital pruritus, perioral dermatitis, acne vulgaris and ophthalmic application. Use is also restricted in children under 4 years for oily cream and ointment (0.3%) for diaper rash and facial application.
* **Interactions:** Diflucortolone may interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Diflucortolone's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Use during pregnancy should be weighed against potential benefits, particularly during the first trimester.  Use with caution in breastfeeding mothers.  Topical application is generally preferred over systemic corticosteroids for skin conditions in pregnancy. Extensive or prolonged use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Children:**  Diflucortolone should be used cautiously in children due to the potential for growth suppression. Monitor growth parameters.
* **Elderly:** Use with caution in the elderly due to increased risk of skin thinning and other side effects.
* **Avoid Occlusive Dressings:** Do not use occlusive dressings as they increase drug absorption and the risk of side effects.
* **Avoid Eyes and Mucous Membranes:** Keep Diflucortolone away from eyes and other mucous membranes.
