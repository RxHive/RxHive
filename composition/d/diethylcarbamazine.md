# Diethylcarbamazine
### Generic Name
Diethylcarbamazine

### Usage
Diethylcarbamazine is an anthelmintic medication primarily used to treat and prevent lymphatic filariasis, a parasitic disease caused by worms like *Wuchereria bancrofti*, *Brugia malayi*, and *Brugia timori*.  These worms infect the lymphatic system, potentially leading to conditions like elephantiasis (extreme swelling of limbs) and hydrocele (fluid buildup in the scrotum).  It's also used to treat loiasis, a parasitic infection caused by the *Loa loa* worm, often known as the "eye worm" because it can migrate across the eye.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated (lymphatic filariasis or loiasis), the specific worm causing the infection, the patient's age and weight, and the treatment approach (single dose vs. multiple doses).  There's no single universally accepted protocol, and recommendations often come from organizations like the WHO and CDC. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Lymphatic Filariasis (Examples - Consult your doctor for precise instructions):**

* **WHO Recommendations (2008):**  Dosage typically starts low and gradually increases over several days. For *Wuchereria bancrofti*, a typical regimen might involve a single low initial dose followed by a higher, divided dose for 12 days.  Regimens for *Brugia* species are similar, but might involve a shorter treatment duration.
* **CDC Recommendations:**  May recommend a different initial dose and duration, potentially extending treatment to 14-21 days in cases of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia.

**Loiasis (Examples - Consult your doctor for precise instructions):**

* **WHO Recommendations (2008):**  Dosage starts low, increases over the first few days and continues for several weeks, often in combination with corticosteroids to minimize adverse reactions.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is typically weight-based and adjusted according to age and the specific infection, usually starting at a lower dose than adults.  Again, always consult a pediatrician for precise instructions.  Some guidelines suggest using adult doses for children over 10 or those over 18 months, but this depends on the specific situation.


**Dosage Forms:** Diethylcarbamazine is usually available as oral tablets or syrup.  

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Muscle aches
* Fever
* Skin rash (including itching)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue
* Difficulty breathing
* Changes in vision
* Severe abdominal pain
* Seizures (especially in people with epilepsy)


**Important:**  If any concerning side effects occur, especially severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Diethylcarbamazine's exact mechanism isn't fully understood. However, it's thought to work by affecting the worms' metabolism, causing their death or immobilization. It might also stimulate the body's immune response to help clear the parasites.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Do not take diethylcarbamazine if you're allergic to it or any of its ingredients.
* **Onchocerciasis:**  Caution is advised in patients with onchocerciasis (river blindness) due to the potential for severe inflammatory reactions.
* **Pregnancy:**  Generally avoided during pregnancy due to risks of severe reactions and the potential for transmission to the fetus.  It’s crucial to discuss treatment with a physician before conceiving or during pregnancy if infection is present.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Use is generally discouraged while breastfeeding because it's unknown if the drug passes into breast milk.
* **Renal and Cardiac Impairment:**  Dose adjustments or careful monitoring are needed in individuals with kidney or heart problems.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although not extensively documented, potential interactions with other medications are possible; discuss all your medications with your doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take diethylcarbamazine with other medications?**  A:  It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, as interactions are possible.

* **Q: How should I store diethylcarbamazine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture. Keep it out of children's reach.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice, as missing doses could compromise treatment effectiveness.  Do not double up on doses unless explicitly instructed by your doctor.

* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: This varies considerably depending on the infection and the treatment protocol your doctor has prescribed.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of diethylcarbamazine?** A: While generally well-tolerated, prolonged use can have side effects such as eye problems, therefore it’s essential to complete the treatment as directed by your doctor.
