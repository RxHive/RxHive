# Dapagliflozin + Metformin + Sitagliptin
### Generic Name
Dapagliflozin + Metformin + Sitagliptin

**Note:**  Dapagliflozin + Metformin + Sitagliptin is a combination medication.  There is no single generic name for this triple combination.  The individual components have their own generic names, and the brand name will vary depending on the manufacturer.  This information describes the combined action of these three drugs.  Always refer to your prescription and consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific details about your medication.


### Usage

This triple combination medication is primarily used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes who haven't achieved adequate blood sugar control with either metformin or a combination of metformin and another diabetes medication.  It combines three different mechanisms of action to target blood sugar control from multiple angles.  The combination therapy is typically considered when other treatments haven't been fully effective.  It's not usually the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes.


### Dosage

Dosage of Dapagliflozin + Metformin + Sitagliptin will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to treatment. There's no single "standard" dose.  The medication is typically taken orally once daily with a meal to minimize stomach upset.  Specific dosages of each component will vary greatly depending on the formulation (different manufacturers may offer slightly different ratios).  Your doctor will adjust your dose based on blood glucose levels and potential side effects.

Less common but serious side effects may include:

*   Severe allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)

*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

This medication works through a combination of three different mechanisms:

*   **Dapagliflozin:** This is a SGLT2 inhibitor. It works by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine, thereby lowering blood sugar levels.

*   **Metformin:** This is a biguanide.  It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin.  It also slightly reduces glucose absorption from the gut.

*   **Sitagliptin:** This is a DPP-4 inhibitor. It enhances the action of incretin hormones, which stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar), leading to better blood sugar control.

By combining these three medications, the treatment aims for a synergistic effect—more effective blood sugar control than any single drug could achieve alone.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used in individuals with severe kidney disease, severe liver disease, or a history of diabetic ketoacidosis.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding require specific consultation with a doctor.

*   **Drug Interactions:** This combination can interact with many other drugs.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.

*   **Alcohol:**  Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking this medication.

*   **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function is often recommended while taking this medication.

*   **Elderly:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary.

*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and discussion with a healthcare professional.
