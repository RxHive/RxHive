# Dapagliflozin + Metformin + Sitagliptin

It's crucial to understand that there is **no single, FDA-approved generic combination drug containing dapagliflozin, metformin, and sitagliptin.**  Pharmaceutical companies typically combine only two of these drugs at a time.  While a triple combination *could* theoretically be developed, it's not currently available.

Therefore, I cannot provide details in the requested format for a non-existent drug.  To get accurate information, you'd need to look at the prescribing information for individual medications:

* **Dapagliflozin:**  (e.g., Forxiga) - SGLT2 inhibitor
* **Metformin:** (e.g., Glucophage) - Biguanide
* **Sitagliptin:** (e.g., Januvia) - DPP-4 inhibitor


Each of these drugs is used to treat type 2 diabetes, but they work through different mechanisms. You should consult with your doctor or pharmacist to determine the best treatment plan for you, which may involve one or more of these medications, but not a triple combination.
