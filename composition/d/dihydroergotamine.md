# Dihydroergotamine
### Generic Name
Dihydroergotamine

### Usage
Dihydroergotamine is primarily used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches, both with and without aura. It's also effective in treating acute cluster headache episodes.  It's crucial to understand that dihydroergotamine is *not* for preventing migraines (prophylaxis) or managing hemiplegic or basilar migraines.  These require different treatment approaches.

### Dosage

Dihydroergotamine dosage varies depending on the route of administration and the severity of the headache.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Exceeding recommended dosages can lead to serious side effects.

**Adults:**

* **Intramuscular (IM) or Subcutaneous (SubQ):**  1 mg at the first sign of a headache. This can be repeated hourly, up to a maximum of 3 mg per day, and a maximum of 6 mg per week.
* **Intravenous (IV):** 1 mg at the first sign of a headache.  This can be repeated hourly, up to a maximum of 2 mg per day, and a maximum of 6 mg per week. IV administration should be slow, usually over 2-3 minutes.
* **Intranasal Spray:** 1 spray (0.5 mg) in each nostril.  This can be repeated after 15 minutes, for a total of 4 sprays (2 mg). Do not exceed 6 sprays (3 mg) in 24 hours or 8 sprays (4 mg) in a week.  The nasal spray should be primed before first use.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of dihydroergotamine have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly defined in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, caution is advised in cases of mild to moderate impairment, and dihydroergotamine is contraindicated in cases of severe impairment in both liver and kidney function.

**Off-Label Uses (Repetitive and Continuous Dosing Regimens):**  In some cases, doctors might use dihydroergotamine via IV infusion with repetitive or continuous dosing protocols for intractable migraine or medication overuse headaches (MOH). These regimens require close medical supervision due to the potential for serious side effects.  The specific protocols (Raskin and Ford protocols) should only be implemented and monitored by experienced healthcare professionals.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These occur in more than 10% of patients using the nasal spray formulation:

* Nasal congestion (rhinitis)

These occur in 1-10% of patients:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Taste disturbances
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Hot flashes
* Application site reactions (nasal spray)
* Stiffness and weakness

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** These are less frequent but can be serious and require immediate medical attention:

* Chest pain
* High blood pressure
* Irregular heartbeat
* Stroke
* Peripheral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the extremities)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Dihydroergotamine is an ergot alkaloid that works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain (vasoconstriction). It achieves this by binding to specific receptors (5-HT1D receptors) in the brain and blood vessels. By constricting these vessels, it helps to reduce the pain associated with migraine headaches.  Additionally, it may also affect the release of inflammatory substances, further contributing to pain relief.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, ischemic heart disease, angina, peripheral vascular disease, severe hepatic or renal impairment, sepsis, pregnancy, breastfeeding, recent vascular surgery, hemiplegic or basilar migraine, or those taking certain medications (see drug interactions).  It's also contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to dihydroergotamine or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Dihydroergotamine interacts with several medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system (including certain protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics).  Combining dihydroergotamine with these drugs significantly increases the risk of serious side effects, primarily peripheral ischemia.  Consult a healthcare professional about potential drug interactions before taking dihydroergotamine, especially if you are on other medications. Concurrent use with triptans or other ergot-like drugs is also contraindicated.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dihydroergotamine is categorized as pregnancy category X (FDA) and C (AUS) – meaning it poses a significant risk to the developing fetus and should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to the side effects of dihydroergotamine, and careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Grapefruit Juice:** Avoid grapefruit juice while taking dihydroergotamine as it can alter the metabolism of the drug and increase the risk of side effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for dihydroergotamine to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration, but generally, relief from migraine pain can be expected within minutes to hours.

* **Q: Can I take dihydroergotamine every day?** A: No. Dihydroergotamine is for acute treatment only and should not be used daily.  Overuse can lead to medication overuse headaches (MOH).

* **Q: How should I store dihydroergotamine?** A: Store as directed on the product label.  Generally, this means protecting it from light, heat, and moisture.  Intranasal sprays have specific storage guidelines – usually use within a certain timeframe after opening.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not try to catch up on missed doses.  Take the next dose as scheduled, but consult with your healthcare professional if you have concerns.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking dihydroergotamine?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while using dihydroergotamine, as alcohol can potentially worsen some side effects or interact with the medication. Always consult your physician or pharmacist before combining medications or substances.
