# Dibekacin
### Generic Name
Dibekacin

### Usage
Dibekacin is a semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic effective against bacterial strains resistant to kanamycin.  Its primary use is in treating serious bacterial infections.  These include, but aren't limited to: endocarditis (heart valve infection), prostatitis (prostate infection), respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, bronchitis), skin and soft tissue infections, surgical site infections, and urinary tract infections.  The choice of Dibekacin is typically reserved for severe infections where other antibiotics have proven ineffective or are contraindicated.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors including the severity of the infection, the patient's weight, age, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's precise instructions.  General guidelines are as follows:

**Adults:** For susceptible infections, the typical dosage is 1-3 mg/kg/day given either intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV) in two divided doses.  IV administration should be a slow infusion over 30-60 minutes. A common daily dose is 100mg, divided.  Dosage adjustments are crucial based on regular monitoring of serum levels and renal function.

**Children:** Dosage for children varies significantly based on age and weight.  Neonates (newborn infants) might receive 3-4 mg/kg/day divided into three or four doses IM. Infants and older children may receive 1-2 mg/kg/day in one or two divided doses IM.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal impairment significantly affects Dibekacin dosage.  The dose must be reduced or the interval between doses increased based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). The prescribing physician will adjust the dosage according to the patient's CrCl.  No specific dosage adjustments are outlined for hepatic impairment in the manufacturerâ€™s labeling.

### Side Effects

Dibekacin, like other aminoglycosides, can cause several side effects.  These include:

* **Ototoxicity:** Damage to the inner ear, potentially leading to hearing loss or balance problems.
* **Nephrotoxicity:** Kidney damage, potentially leading to acute renal failure.
* **Electrolyte disturbances:** Imbalances in blood electrolytes.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis.
* **Respiratory depression:** Slowed breathing.
* **Muscular paralysis:** Weakness or paralysis of muscles.
* **Gastrointestinal upset:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
* **Anorexia:** Loss of appetite.
* **Local reactions (at injection site):** Pain, redness, inflammation.

While less common, serious side effects warrant immediate medical attention.  Consult a healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Dibekacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. This means it kills bacteria rather than just inhibiting their growth.  It works by binding to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits of bacteria.  This interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from producing essential proteins needed for survival, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  Dibekacin is effective against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and some strains of staphylococci.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dibekacin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Dibekacin or any of its components, those with known or suspected perforated eardrums (for topical ear application), and pregnant women.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, impaired renal function, cystic fibrosis, infants, the elderly, obese individuals, or those with poor oral nutrition.  Concurrent use with anesthetics or muscle relaxants requires careful monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Dibekacin is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of ototoxicity to the fetus.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; use during lactation should be approached with caution and under close medical supervision.
* **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of renal and auditory function is essential during Dibekacin therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Dibekacin?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection and your response to the medication.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.
* **Q: Can I take Dibekacin with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.  Some medications may interact with Dibekacin.
* **Q: How should I store Dibekacin?** A: Store Dibekacin as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Dibekacin when I feel better?** A: No, complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and potential development of antibiotic resistance.
