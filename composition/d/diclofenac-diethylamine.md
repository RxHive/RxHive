# Diclofenac diethylamine
### Generic Name
Diclofenac Diethylamine

### Usage

Diclofenac diethylamine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its main applications include treating:

* **Pain:**  This includes mild to moderate pain from various sources such as muscle aches, sprains, strains, headaches (including menstrual cramps), and post-surgical or post-traumatic pain.  It's often used for the symptomatic relief of pain, not as a cure for the underlying condition.

* **Inflammation:**  Diclofenac diethylamine effectively reduces inflammation in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other forms of inflammatory joint disease.  It helps to alleviate the swelling, stiffness, and pain associated with these conditions.

* **Topical use:** Certain formulations of diclofenac diethylamine are available as topical gels or creams for localized pain and inflammation in conditions like back pain, shoulder pain, and tendinitis.  This method reduces the risk of systemic side effects compared to oral administration.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (oral, topical, or injection), the condition being treated, the patient's age, and other factors.  **It's crucial to follow the doctor's prescription exactly.**  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

* **Oral (Tablet/Capsule):**  Adult dosages typically range from 75mg to 150mg per day, divided into multiple doses. Children's dosages are strictly determined by a physician based on weight and age.  Specific formulations and dosages should always be prescribed by a doctor.


* **Topical (Gel/Cream):**  Apply a thin layer to the affected area as directed on the product label.  Usually, 1-4 applications per day are prescribed, but this can vary.  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.


* **Intravenous (IV):** Intravenous administration is generally used in a hospital setting for severe pain and inflammation and is administered by a healthcare professional. Dosages are tailored to the individual's needs and medical condition.


**Note:**  There are no universally standardized dosages for children.  Pediatric use of diclofenac diethylamine is often restricted to specific situations and requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Indigestion
* Heartburn
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Increased risk of bleeding


Less common but serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Stomach ulcers
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* Cardiovascular events (increased risk of heart attack or stroke, especially with long-term use)


**If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Diclofenac diethylamine works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, diclofenac diethylamine helps to alleviate pain and inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Diclofenac diethylamine should not be used by individuals with known allergies to diclofenac or other NSAIDs, severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcer disease, or those with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Diclofenac diethylamine can interact with several other medications, including blood thinners (anticoagulants), other NSAIDs, and certain diuretics.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of diclofenac diethylamine during pregnancy, especially in the later stages, is generally discouraged due to potential risks to the fetus. Consult with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be at increased risk of side effects, especially gastrointestinal problems and cardiovascular events. Careful monitoring is usually necessary.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking diclofenac diethylamine as it can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.
