# Drospirenone + Estetrol
### Generic Name
Drospirenone + Estetrol

### Usage
Drospirenone and Estetrol is a combined hormonal contraceptive pill used by females of reproductive age to prevent pregnancy.  It's a combination of a progestin (drospirenone) and an estrogen (estetrol).  This combination works to prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  It also thickens cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and it may alter the uterine lining, making it less hospitable for implantation.  There are no notable secondary uses beyond contraception.

### Dosage
**Adults (Females of Reproductive Age):** The usual dose is one tablet (containing 3 mg drospirenone and 14.2 mg estetrol) taken orally once daily, at approximately the same time each day, with or without food.  The tablets are taken in the order presented on the blister pack for a 28-day cycle (24 active tablets followed by 4 inactive tablets).

* **Day 1 Start:** For women not currently using hormonal contraception, the first active tablet should be taken on the first day of their menstrual cycle.
* **Non-Day 1 Start:** If starting outside of the first day of the menstrual cycle, a non-hormonal backup method of contraception (such as condoms) must be used for the first 7 days.
* **Switching from Other Contraceptives:** Specific instructions for switching from other hormonal contraceptive methods (pills, patches, rings, injections, implants, IUDs) are provided in the full prescribing information and should be followed carefully.  The instructions depend on the type of contraceptive being replaced and whether a woman is postpartum.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Drospirenone and Estetrol have only been established in females of reproductive age.  It's not indicated for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Drospirenone and Estetrol is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works
Drospirenone and Estetrol is a combined hormonal contraceptive that prevents pregnancy through a multi-pronged approach.  Drospirenone, a progestin, has antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic properties.  Estetrol, an estrogen, is a naturally occurring estrogen in pregnancy and is not metabolized to estradiol or estriol.  The combination works primarily by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  It also thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg and potentially alters the uterine lining to hinder implantation.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Drospirenone and Estetrol is contraindicated in women with a history of certain cancers (especially breast cancer), unexplained vaginal bleeding, liver tumors, severe liver disease, adrenal insufficiency, kidney impairment,  uncontrolled hypertension, a history of blood clots, migraines with aura, or those who smoke and are over 35 years of age. It should not be used with specific Hepatitis C drug combinations (containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without dasabuvir).


**Interactions:**  Drospirenone and Estetrol can interact with various medications, including some enzyme inducers and inhibitors (affecting how the drug is processed in the body), anti-diabetic drugs, lamotrigine (an anti-seizure medication), and corticosteroids.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking.


**Warnings:** Women using Drospirenone and Estetrol have an increased risk of blood clots, high blood pressure, and other cardiovascular issues.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure is recommended.  The risk is higher in smokers and those over 35. The risk of thromboembolic events is increased in the postpartum period and therefore should not be initiated less than 4 weeks postpartum.  Pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or a family history of blood clots must be discussed with a healthcare provider.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Drospirenone and Estetrol is a contraceptive; its use should be discontinued if pregnancy occurs.  Limited amounts of the hormones are excreted in breast milk; consult your doctor about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while using this medication.
