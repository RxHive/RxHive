# Doxepin (Topical)
### Generic Name
Doxepin (Topical)

### Usage
Doxepin topical cream is primarily used for the short-term (up to 8 days) management of moderate itching (pruritus) in adult patients with atopic dermatitis (eczema) or lichen simplex chronicus (a skin condition causing intense itching and thickening of the skin).  It's crucial to remember that this is a short-term treatment for symptom relief, not a cure for these underlying conditions.  

While not officially approved for these uses, doxepin topical cream is sometimes used off-label to treat burning mouth syndrome and neuropathic pain.  However, the effectiveness and safety in these conditions are less well-established than for its primary use in pruritus related to atopic dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus.  Always discuss off-label uses with your healthcare provider.


### Dosage

**Pruritus (moderate), due to atopic dermatitis or lichen simplex chronicus:**

* **Cream (5%):** Apply a thin film to the affected area four times a day, at intervals of at least 3-4 hours.  Using the cream for longer than 8 days is not recommended.  Applying the cream to more than 10% of your body surface area increases the risk of systemic side effects. If excessive drowsiness occurs, reduce the area covered, amount used, frequency of application, or discontinue use.

**Off-label Uses:**  Dosage for off-label uses like burning mouth syndrome or neuropathic pain varies and should be determined by your doctor. For example, for neuropathic pain, a 3.3% cream (requiring extemporaneous preparation by a compounding pharmacy) might be applied three times a day.

**Pediatric Use:**  Doxepin topical cream is not recommended for children.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of users):**

* Drowsiness
* Burning sensation of the skin
* Stinging of the skin


**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of users):**

* Dizziness
* Emotional lability (mood swings)
* Edema (swelling)
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Anxiety
* Contact dermatitis
* Numbness of the tongue


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Doxepin's topical form works by blocking histamine receptors (H1 and H2).  Histamine is a substance in the body that contributes to itching.  While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood,  blocking these receptors reduces the itching sensation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Doxepin topical cream is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to doxepin or other dibenzoxazepine compounds, untreated narrow-angle glaucoma, a tendency towards urinary retention, and children under 12 years old.

* **Drug Interactions:** Doxepin can interact with several other medications.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor or pharmacist before using doxepin topical cream.

* **Warnings:** Doxepin can prolong the QT interval (a measure of heart rhythm), potentially increasing the risk of arrhythmias.  It can also cause anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation).  Use caution in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using doxepin.

* **General Precautions:** Apply only a thin layer to the affected area. Avoid contact with eyes, and don't use occlusive dressings (bandages that prevent air from reaching the skin). Avoid alcohol while using this medication.  Drowsiness may occur; avoid operating machinery or driving while using this medication.
