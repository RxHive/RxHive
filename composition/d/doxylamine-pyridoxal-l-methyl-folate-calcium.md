# Doxylamine + Pyridoxal- + L-Methyl Folate Calcium

**Generic Name:** Doxylamine + Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate + L-Methylfolate Calcium

**Usage:**

This combination medication is primarily used to address nausea and vomiting, particularly during pregnancy (morning sickness).  The components work synergistically: doxylamine is an antihistamine with mild sedative properties that helps reduce nausea, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (vitamin B6) plays a crucial role in many bodily functions and may also assist in nausea control, and L-methylfolate calcium (a form of folate or vitamin B9) is essential for cell growth and development.  While primarily used for nausea in pregnancy, it may sometimes be considered for other types of nausea, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision.  It's vital to understand that this is *not* a first-line treatment for all forms of nausea and vomiting and should only be used as directed by a doctor.

**Dosage:**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation and the healthcare provider's prescription.  There is no standard universally applicable dosage for adults or children.  The medication is typically available in tablet form.  *Never* administer this medication to yourself or anyone else without a doctor's prescription and guidance.  The instructions provided with your specific prescription must be followed precisely. Self-medicating can be dangerous.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), severe drowsiness or sedation, irregular heartbeat.
* **Important Note:**  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention.


**How it Works:**

Doxylamine blocks the action of histamine in the brain, reducing nausea and inducing mild sedation. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate's precise role in nausea reduction is not fully understood, but it is believed to influence neurotransmitter function that impacts nausea pathways. L-methylfolate supports various bodily functions, including cell growth and potentially contributing to a healthier pregnancy. The combination of these three active ingredients aims to alleviate nausea through different mechanisms, providing a multi-pronged approach.

**Popular Brand Names (India):**
