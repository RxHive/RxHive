# Dornase Alfa
### Generic Name
Dornase Alfa

### Usage
Dornase alfa is a medication primarily used to manage cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults and children.  It's used in conjunction with standard CF therapies.  Its main purpose is to improve lung function and decrease the risk of serious respiratory infections that require treatment with intravenous antibiotics.  This benefit is most pronounced in patients with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 40% or more of the predicted value. Dornase alfa works by breaking down the thick, sticky mucus characteristic of CF, making it easier to cough up and improving breathing.

### Dosage

**Cystic Fibrosis:**

* **Inhalation:** The usual dose is 2.5 mg once daily (OD), administered via a jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor system.  The recommended nebulizers include the eRapid Nebulizer System, Durable Sidestream, Hudson T Up-draft II, Marquest Acorn II, PARIBABY, or PARI LC Plus. Airflow should be approximately 3.5-9 L/min at 20-45 psi.  The eRapid Nebulizer System handsets should be replaced after 90 uses.  Some patients may benefit from twice-daily administration, but this should be determined by a physician.
* **Adults and Children:** The dosage is the same for both adults and children.
* **Important Note:**  Dornase alfa should *not* be diluted or mixed with other medications in the nebulizer.  This can affect the drug's effectiveness.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Voice changes (hoarseness)
* Chest pain
* Cough
* Sore throat (pharyngitis)
* Runny nose (rhinitis)
* Decrease in forced vital capacity (a measure of lung function)
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Skin rash
* Fever

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
* Laryngitis (inflammation of the voice box)
* Indigestion (dyspepsia)
* Development of antibodies to the drug


**Rare Side Effects (<1% or reported post-marketing):**

* Headache
* Hives (urticaria)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Dornase alfa is a type of enzyme called a deoxyribonuclease (DNase). It's a genetically engineered (recombinant) version of a naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In cystic fibrosis, thick mucus in the lungs contains large amounts of DNA from dead white blood cells. Dornase alfa targets and breaks down this DNA, making the mucus less viscous and easier to clear from the airways. This improves lung function and reduces the risk of infections.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dornase alfa is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to dornase alfa, Chinese hamster ovary cell products (used in its production), or any other component of the formulation.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Allergic reactions, including rash and hives, are possible.  Monitor for signs of allergic reactions.
* **Pulmonary Function:**  While generally improving pulmonary function, there's a potential for decreased lung function in some patients. Regular monitoring is important.
* **Children Under 5:** Use in children under 5 years old should be approached cautiously.
* **Use with other CF therapies:** Dornase alfa is part of a comprehensive CF treatment plan and should be used in conjunction with other standard therapies, not as a standalone treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dornase alfa is classified as a Category B drug during pregnancy, meaning studies in animals have not shown harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The decision to breastfeed while using dornase alfa should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, considering both the benefits of treatment and the potential risk to the infant.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Dornase alfa?** A:  Improvement in lung function may not be immediately noticeable.  Regular monitoring of lung function is necessary to assess the drug's effectiveness.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Dornase alfa if I feel better?** A:  No.  Do not stop taking dornase alfa without consulting your doctor.  Consistent use is essential for maintaining the benefits of treatment.

* **Q: How should I store Dornase alfa?** A: Store unopened vials at room temperature, protected from light. Once opened, use immediately.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it's almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: No significant drug interactions are currently known, but itâ€™s always best to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.
