# Diclofenac + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Paracetamol (also known as Diclofenac/Paracetamol, Diclofenac sodium + Paracetamol)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and inflammation.  It's often prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Musculoskeletal pain:**  Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, back pain, muscle aches.
* **Post-surgical pain:**  Pain following minor surgery or procedures.
* **Dental pain:**  Pain associated with toothaches or dental procedures.

* **Headaches:**  Although less common, it can be used for some types of headaches.


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list, and the specific use should be determined by a healthcare professional.  The combination is generally not recommended for long-term use.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, headache.

**Important Note:**  This is not a complete list of possible side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

By combining these two drugs, the medication provides both anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects, offering more comprehensive pain management than either drug alone.
