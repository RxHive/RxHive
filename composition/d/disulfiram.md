# Disulfiram
### Generic Name
Disulfiram

### Usage
Disulfiram is primarily used in the management of chronic alcoholism.  Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is crucial in the metabolism of alcohol. This inhibition leads to a buildup of acetaldehyde in the body when alcohol is consumed, resulting in unpleasant side effects.  This unpleasant reaction acts as a deterrent to drinking alcohol.  It's important to note that Disulfiram is not a cure for alcoholism; it's a tool used in conjunction with counseling and other support systems to help individuals maintain sobriety.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  The initial dose of Disulfiram is typically up to 500mg once daily for one to two weeks. The average maintenance dose is 250mg once daily, but this can range from 125mg to 500mg daily, depending on individual response and physician recommendation. The maximum daily dose is 500mg. Disulfiram should not be administered until the patient has abstained from alcohol for at least 12 hours. The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the individual's progress and needs and can range from months to years.  It's crucial to remember that this medication should be taken daily without interruption.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Disulfiram in children have not been established. It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, however, it must be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney disease.  Close monitoring is required.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Bitter or metallic taste, drowsiness, fatigue, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic dermatitis, skin rash, acneiform eruption, impotence, optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic failure (rare but potentially fatal).  These serious side effects emphasize the importance of regular medical check-ups while on this medication.

If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).  When someone taking Disulfiram consumes alcohol, the body's normal process of breaking down alcohol is disrupted. Acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism, builds up in the bloodstream. This accumulation causes unpleasant and potentially dangerous side effects such as nausea, vomiting, flushing, headache, and rapid heartbeat. This unpleasant reaction serves as a deterrent to alcohol consumption, aiding in maintaining sobriety.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Disulfiram is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Disulfiram or other thiuram derivatives, those currently consuming alcohol or certain medications (see interactions below), severe myocardial disease, coronary occlusion, or psychosis.

* **Drug Interactions:** Disulfiram can interact dangerously with several medications, including metronidazole, tinidazole, amprenavir, dronabinol, paraldehyde, and tranylcypromine. Concurrent use is generally not recommended due to the potential for serious adverse reactions, including CNS toxicity and increased risk of delirium.  The interaction with alcohol is significant and potentially life-threatening, necessitating strict abstinence from alcohol.

* **Warnings:**  Disulfiram should not be given to someone who is already intoxicated.  It should also be used with extreme caution in individuals with hepatic or renal impairment, diabetes, hypothyroidism, cerebral damage, or a history of seizure disorder.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Disulfiram is classified as a Category C drug during pregnancy.  Its use during pregnancy is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary and the benefits outweigh the risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Disulfiram.
