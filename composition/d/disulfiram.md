# Disulfiram

**Generic Name:** Disulfiram

**Usage:**  Disulfiram is used as a deterrent for people with alcohol use disorder. It doesn't cure alcoholism, but it creates an unpleasant reaction if alcohol is consumed while taking it. This reaction acts as a negative reinforcement to help individuals abstain from drinking.  It's important to note that disulfiram is only effective if the patient is committed to abstinence and is used under strict medical supervision.

**Side Effects:** Disulfiram can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others more serious.  These can include:

* **Mild:**  Metallic taste in the mouth, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash.
* **Serious:**  Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), psychosis (rare), allergic reactions (rare).  **The most serious reaction is the disulfiram-alcohol reaction**, which can include flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, hypotension (low blood pressure), and even death in severe cases.


**How it Works:** Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism.  When alcohol is consumed while taking disulfiram, acetaldehyde builds up in the body, leading to the unpleasant and potentially dangerous disulfiram-alcohol reaction. This reaction acts as a strong deterrent to drinking.
