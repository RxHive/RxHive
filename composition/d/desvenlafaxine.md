# Desvenlafaxine
### Generic Name
Desvenlafaxine

### Usage

Desvenlafaxine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), meaning it works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. These neurotransmitters play a crucial role in mood regulation. While its primary indication is MDD, desvenlafaxine is sometimes used off-label to manage vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, particularly in women who can't or don't want to take estrogen.  However, it's important to note that this off-label use isn't as extensively studied as its use for depression.


### Dosage

**Major Depressive Disorder (Adults):** The typical starting and maintenance dose is 50 mg once daily (OD).  While higher doses up to 400 mg/day have been used, there's no proven benefit to increasing the dose beyond 50mg.  The need for continued treatment should be regularly assessed by a healthcare professional. When stopping treatment, gradually reducing the dose (e.g., using a 25 mg/day dose for a period of time) is recommended to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

**Vasomotor Symptoms of Menopause (Off-label, Adults):** The starting dose is typically 50 mg OD.  The dose may be gradually increased in 25-50 mg increments daily to reach a target dose, which can vary between 100 mg and 150 mg daily, depending on individual response.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of desvenlafaxine haven't been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No adjustment needed for mild impairment. For moderate to severe impairment, start with 50 mg OD and do not exceed 100 mg OD.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  Refer to a healthcare professional for specific recommendations based on individual CrCl levels.  Generally, lower doses are needed for individuals with reduced kidney function.
* **Switching from other antidepressants or MAOIs:**  Gradual tapering of the previous medication may be necessary to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  A specific waiting period is required before switching between desvenlafaxine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) to prevent dangerous interactions.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)
* Nausea
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or less frequently):**

* Increased blood pressure
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, rash)
* Changes in libido
* Weight changes
* Sleep disturbances (abnormal dreams)
* Sexual dysfunction (delayed ejaculation, anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (this is a serious concern with all antidepressants, and close monitoring is necessary).


**Rare but serious side effects**:  Acute pancreatitis, angle-closure glaucoma, cardiomyopathy (takotsubo), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported.

If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately for guidance.


### How it Works

Desvenlafaxine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). It works by blocking the reabsorption (reuptake) of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.  By preventing reuptake, desvenlafaxine increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, enhancing their effects and potentially improving mood and reducing depressive symptoms. The exact mechanism by which this leads to improvements in depression is not fully understood, but the increased levels of these neurotransmitters are believed to play a key role.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Desvenlafaxine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine,  those currently taking or who have recently discontinued MAOIs (specific waiting periods apply), and those receiving linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.
* **Interactions:** Desvenlafaxine can interact with several medications, including other antidepressants, MAOIs,  antiplatelet agents (aspirin, NSAIDs), and analgesics. Consult with a doctor or pharmacist before combining desvenlafaxine with other medications.
* **Warnings:** Desvenlafaxine carries a boxed warning regarding the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in young adults.  Close monitoring for suicidal ideation is crucial, particularly at the start of treatment or with dose changes.  Other warnings include potential risks of serotonin syndrome, elevated blood pressure, bleeding, angle-closure glaucoma, mania/hypomania activation, discontinuation syndrome, seizures, hyponatremia, and others.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Desvenlafaxine is a pregnancy category C drug.  Use during the third trimester may cause neonatal discontinuation syndrome.  It's excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of using this medication.
* **Specific Populations:**  Desvenlafaxine should be used cautiously in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, compensated hepatic cirrhosis, a history of seizures, renal impairment, bipolar disorder, or a family history of mania or hypomania.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking desvenlafaxine?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking desvenlafaxine, as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store desvenlafaxine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I stop taking desvenlafaxine suddenly?** A: No, stopping desvenlafaxine suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment; they will guide you on how to safely taper off the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience suicidal thoughts?** A:  Contact your doctor or seek immediate help if you experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors. This is a serious concern that needs immediate medical attention.  

* **Q: What if the tablet shell appears in my stool?** A: This is normal. The active medication has already been absorbed.
