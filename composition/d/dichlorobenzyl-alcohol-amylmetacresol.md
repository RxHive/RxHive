# Dichlorobenzyl Alcohol + Amylmetacresol
### Generic Name
Dichlorobenzyl Alcohol + Amylmetacresol

**Note:**  Dichlorobenzyl alcohol and amylmetacresol are most commonly used together in combination, often as an antiseptic and disinfectant.  There isn't a single, universally accepted generic name for this combination. The information below pertains to the combined action of these two ingredients.

### Usage

This combination of dichlorobenzyl alcohol and amylmetacresol is primarily used as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant.  Its main application lies in treating minor cuts, scrapes, and abrasions to prevent infection.  It's often found in antiseptic solutions and creams. While primarily used for topical application, some formulations might be used as a throat spray or gargle to relieve minor throat irritation associated with infections.  It's important to note that this combination is not suitable for treating deep wounds, serious infections, or burns.  Always consult a healthcare professional for significant injuries or persistent infections.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (cream, solution, spray, etc.) and the intended use.  There are no standard oral or IV dosages for this combination, as it's intended for topical application only.  

* **Topical Application:**  The instructions for use are usually printed on the product label.  Generally, a small amount is applied directly to the affected area, ensuring the skin is clean and dry beforehand.  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  For throat sprays or gargles, follow the specific instructions on the product packaging.   
* **Children:**  Use should be guided by a healthcare professional, particularly in young children.  Always use a formulation specifically designed for pediatric use and follow the labelled dosage instructions closely.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Mild skin irritation, redness, or burning sensation at the application site are possible. These are typically temporary and resolve quickly.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions, including skin rash, itching, or swelling, are possible, although uncommon.  In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions may occur.
* **Note:** If any adverse reaction occurs, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Dichlorobenzyl alcohol and amylmetacresol work synergistically to provide an antiseptic and disinfectant effect.  Dichlorobenzyl alcohol disrupts the cell membranes of bacteria and fungi, leading to their death.  Amylmetacresol possesses similar antimicrobial properties, acting as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent against a range of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi.  The combination enhances their individual antimicrobial efficacy, resulting in a wider range of activity and greater effectiveness in preventing infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Avoid use if you have known allergies to dichlorobenzyl alcohol, amylmetacresol, or any other ingredients in the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions with other drugs are commonly reported, but always inform your healthcare provider or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe for topical use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, consult a doctor before use, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Deep Wounds/Burns:** Do not use this combination on deep wounds or serious burns. Seek professional medical attention for such injuries.
