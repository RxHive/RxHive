# Dalteparin

**Generic Name:** Dalteparin sodium

**Usage:**

Dalteparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used to prevent and treat blood clots (thrombosis) in various situations, including:

* **Prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after surgery:** Particularly in patients undergoing major abdominal or orthopedic surgery.
* **Treatment of DVT and PE:**  To prevent the clot from growing and to reduce the risk of further complications.
* **Treatment of unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI):**  In combination with other therapies.
* **Treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS):**  In specific situations, usually in conjunction with other treatments.
* **Prevention of blood clots in patients with certain conditions:** Such as those with a history of blood clots or those who are immobile for extended periods.

**Note:** The specific dosage and duration of treatment vary depending on the individual's condition, medical history, and the healthcare provider's assessment.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk.  It can range from minor bruising to serious internal bleeding.
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, bruising, swelling, redness, or discoloration at the injection site.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** A decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, increasing the risk of bleeding. This is a rare but serious side effect that requires close monitoring.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Although relatively uncommon.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rarely, severe allergic reactions can occur.

**How it Works:**

Dalteparin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It works by binding to antithrombin III, a protein in the blood that inhibits several clotting factors, primarily factor Xa and to a lesser extent thrombin.  By enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, dalteparin reduces the formation of blood clots.  LMWHs like dalteparin have a longer half-life and more predictable anticoagulant effect compared to unfractionated heparin, requiring less frequent monitoring.


**FAQs:**

* **How is dalteparin administered?** Dalteparin is usually given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.  Never administer it intravenously unless explicitly instructed by a healthcare provider.
* **How often do I need blood tests?** Your doctor will determine the need for blood tests based on your individual situation and risk factors.  Monitoring may involve testing platelet counts and other coagulation parameters.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **What interactions can occur with other medications?** Dalteparin can interact with other medications, including other anticoagulants, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), aspirin, and some antibiotics.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **What are the signs of bleeding?** Signs of bleeding can vary from minor bruising to more serious symptoms such as blood in urine or stool, prolonged bleeding from cuts, dizziness, weakness, and unexplained bruising.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning bleeding.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking dalteparin?** Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of bleeding.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Is dalteparin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The use of dalteparin during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits against the potential risks.
