# Dalteparin
### Generic Name
Dalteparin

### Usage

Dalteparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used to prevent and treat blood clots (thromboembolism).  Its primary uses include:

* **Prevention of ischemic complications:** In patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, alongside aspirin therapy.
* **Prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE):** In patients undergoing abdominal surgery, total hip arthroplasty, or those at risk for thromboembolism due to immobility from acute illness.  Specific risk factors include age over 40, obesity, malignancy, and a history of DVT or PE.
* **Treatment of symptomatic VTE:** To reduce recurrence in adults and children (including infants over one month old).  This includes both DVT and PE.  Extended treatment (up to 6 months) is used in cancer patients to reduce recurrence.
* **Prevention of clotting in extracorporeal systems:** During hemodialysis and hemofiltration in patients with acute renal failure or chronic renal insufficiency.

While not its primary indication, Dalteparin is also sometimes used off-label in other situations, such as treating superficial vein thrombosis or bridging anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valves.  The use of Dalteparin in these situations should be guided by a healthcare professional considering the patient's specific circumstances and risks.


### Dosage

Dalteparin dosage is highly variable and depends on the specific condition being treated, the patient's weight and renal function, and whether it's for prophylaxis (prevention) or treatment.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.  The following information is for general understanding only and should not be used for self-medication:

**Adults:** Dosage varies widely depending on the indication (see the detailed prescribing information for specifics).  It is typically administered subcutaneously (under the skin) but can be given intravenously (IV) in certain situations (e.g., hemodialysis). Doses are often calculated based on body weight.  For example, in the treatment of VTE in cancer patients, the initial dose might be 200 units/kg (with a maximum of 18,000 units) daily for 30 days, followed by a lower maintenance dose.  Prophylactic doses are typically much lower.

**Children:**  Dosage is also highly variable and weight-based, and often requires blood tests (Anti-Factor Xa levels) to optimize the dose and reduce risks. The use of Dalteparin in children should only be under the direct supervision of a physician experienced in pediatric hematology or oncology.  Specific dosages for prophylaxis and treatment of VTE are dependent on the child's age and weight and usually involve lower doses compared to adults.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Bruising at the injection site
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)


Less common, but serious side effects:

* Major hemorrhage (heavy bleeding)
* Spinal or epidural hematoma (bleeding around the spinal cord, potentially causing paralysis â€“ this is a very serious and rare risk)
* Allergic reactions


If you experience any adverse effects, especially unusual bleeding, bruising, or neurological symptoms (e.g., back pain, weakness, numbness), contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Dalteparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin.  It works by binding to antithrombin III, a protein in the blood.  This complex then inhibits several clotting factors, particularly Factor Xa and, to a lesser extent, Factor IIa (thrombin). By inhibiting these clotting factors, Dalteparin prevents the formation of blood clots and reduces the risk of thromboembolic events like DVT and PE.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dalteparin is contraindicated in patients with active major bleeding, hypersensitivity to heparin or its components, and history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).  It should generally be avoided in patients with conditions that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., recent surgery, ulcers, uncontrolled hypertension).

* **Interactions:**  Dalteparin's effects can be altered by other drugs, including other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (like aspirin), NSAIDs, and some antibiotics.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Dalteparin is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning studies in animals have not shown harm, but human data are limited.  It should be used during pregnancy only if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks, and under close medical supervision.  Small amounts are excreted in breast milk, but the clinical significance is considered low. However, this should be discussed with a physician.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Patients with kidney or liver problems may require dose adjustments due to altered drug clearance.

* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients are generally more prone to bleeding complications and should be monitored closely.

* **Neuraxial Anesthesia:**  There is a risk of spinal or epidural hematoma with neuraxial anesthesia (spinal tap or epidural). This risk is particularly high in patients receiving Dalteparin.  The risk and benefits must be carefully weighed before procedures involving neuraxial anesthesia are undertaken.

* **Obesity:**  The dosage may need to be adjusted for obese patients.



### FAQs

* **Q: How is Dalteparin administered?** A: Usually subcutaneously, but intravenous administration is sometimes necessary.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

* **Q: How long do I need to take Dalteparin?** A: This depends entirely on your condition and medical advice.  Treatment duration can range from days to months.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance; do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I take Dalteparin with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all your medications; certain combinations can be dangerous.
