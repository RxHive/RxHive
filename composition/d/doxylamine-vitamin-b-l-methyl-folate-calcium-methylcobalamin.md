# Doxylamine + Vitamin B + L-Methyl Folate Calcium + Methylcobalamin
### Generic Name
Doxylamine Succinate + Vitamin B Complex (with L-Methylfolate Calcium and Methylcobalamin)


**Note:** This combination is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination.  The ingredients are often found together in over-the-counter (OTC) supplements marketed for sleep aid and/or nutritional support, but the specific formulation and ratios vary widely between brands. Therefore, the following information is generalized and should *not* be considered a substitute for consulting the product's specific label for dosage and usage instructions.  Always follow the directions provided by your doctor or the product labeling.

### Usage

This combination product typically aims to address several conditions simultaneously:

* **Sleep Aid:** Doxylamine succinate is an antihistamine with sedative properties, primarily used to treat insomnia and promote sleep.

* **Vitamin B Deficiencies:** The B vitamins (including L-methylfolate calcium and methylcobalamin, specific forms of folate and vitamin B12) are essential for numerous bodily functions, including energy production, nerve function, and red blood cell formation.  This combination might be used to address deficiencies, although a doctor should diagnose and manage any deficiencies. Supplementation should be guided by professional advice as excessive intake can be harmful.

**Secondary Uses:** The individual components may have additional, albeit less common, uses, but using this combined product for those purposes would require a physician's recommendation.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific product.  **There is no single standard dosage for this combination.**  Always refer to the product label for precise instructions.  Generally:

* **Doxylamine Succinate:**  Dosage for sleep aid is typically determined by age and weight. It is generally not recommended for children under 12, and higher doses are not necessarily safer or more effective.  Always check the product label for the recommended adult dose.

* **Vitamins B Complex:**  The dosage of B vitamins depends on individual needs, and those should be determined through blood tests by a medical practitioner. Excessive intake can be detrimental.

**Oral Administration:** This combination is typically administered orally in tablet or capsule form.  Follow the manufacturer's instructions precisely.

**IV Administration:** This combination is *not* intended for intravenous administration.  The components are not formulated for injection.

* Drowsiness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (may relate to any component):**

### How it Works

* **Doxylamine Succinate:** This antihistamine blocks histamine receptors in the brain, leading to a sedative effect.

* **Vitamin B Complex (including L-methylfolate calcium and methylcobalamin):**  These B vitamins play crucial roles in various metabolic processes, especially those involving energy production, nerve function, and DNA synthesis.  L-methylfolate calcium is a better-absorbed form of folate, and methylcobalamin is a form of vitamin B12 that is readily utilized by the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use this combination if you are allergic to any of its ingredients.  Do not use it if you have glaucoma, prostate problems, or difficulty urinating. It should be avoided with MAO inhibitors or other medications causing drowsiness.

* **Drug Interactions:** This combination can interact with other medications. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.  In particular, interaction with certain antidepressants or other CNS-depressants are possible.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of doxylamine during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be considered under the strict guidance of a doctor.


* **Elderly and Children:** Doxylamine should be used cautiously in older adults due to increased risk of side effects.  Its use in children is generally not recommended except as explicitly directed by a pediatrician.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol while using this product due to the additive sedative effects.
