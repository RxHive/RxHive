# Dilazep
### Generic Name
Dilazep

### Usage
Dilazep is primarily used to treat proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) resulting from kidney diseases, specifically mild-to-moderate IgA nephropathy.  It's also sometimes used in the treatment of stable angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart).  The use of dilazep for angina is less common compared to its use in managing proteinuria associated with kidney disease.  It's important to note that dilazep is not a first-line treatment for either condition and its use should be determined by a physician based on individual patient needs and other factors.


### Dosage

**Proteinuria due to kidney disease/mild-to-moderate IgA nephropathy (Adults):** The typical dosage is 100 mg three times daily (TID) orally.

**Stable angina pectoris (Adults):** The typical dosage is 50 mg three times daily (TID) orally.

**Pediatric Use:** Dilazep is contraindicated in children.  There is no established safe and effective dosage for pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dilazep is contraindicated in patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** While specific dosage adjustments aren't outlined in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with kidney impairment, caution is advised.  A doctor should carefully monitor patients with renal issues.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of dilazep may include:

* Nervous system: Anxiety, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, irritability
* Cardiovascular: Chest discomfort, facial flushing, orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing), palpitations, tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Dermatologic: Diaphoresis (excessive sweating), erythema (redness), pruritus (itching), skin rash
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* Other: Hot flashes, joint stiffness, shoulder pain, increased serum ALT levels (a liver enzyme), leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)


Less common but potentially serious side effects warrant immediate medical attention.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works

Dilazep works by increasing extracellular adenosine levels. Adenosine has several effects relevant to dilazep's therapeutic actions. It causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) in coronary, cerebral, and renal arteries, improving blood flow to these organs.  Furthermore, it exerts antiplatelet effects (preventing blood clots), which is particularly beneficial in managing angina. By improving blood flow and inhibiting platelet aggregation, dilazep helps reduce the symptoms associated with both proteinuria related to kidney disease and angina.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dilazep is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to dilazep or its components, those with hepatic impairment, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of allergic reactions.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with renal failure.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Potential drug interactions exist, and your physician can help assess any risks.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Dilazep is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the unknown effects on the fetus and infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store dilazep?** A: Store dilazep as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
