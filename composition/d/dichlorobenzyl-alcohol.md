# Dichlorobenzyl Alcohol
### Generic Name
Dichlorobenzyl Alcohol

### Usage
Dichlorobenzyl alcohol is primarily used as a mild antiseptic, most commonly found as an ingredient in lozenges (throat lozenges or cough drops).  Its main application is in the treatment of minor infections of the mouth and throat.  While it's effective against some bacteria and fungi, it's not a broad-spectrum antiseptic and shouldn't be relied upon for serious infections.  It's generally considered a topical antiseptic, meaning it's applied directly to the affected area.


### Dosage
The dosage of dichlorobenzyl alcohol is not typically specified as a standalone medication.  Instead, it's found in pre-formulated products like lozenges, where the concentration is already determined by the manufacturer.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product packaging regarding the frequency and number of lozenges to be used.  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.  There are no specific pediatric dosages as the use is typically limited to adults and older children able to use lozenges.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

*   Slight burning or tingling sensation in the mouth or throat.
*   Mild irritation of the mouth or throat.

Serious side effects are rare, but if you experience any unusual symptoms, discontinue use and contact a healthcare professional immediately.  Allergic reactions are also possible; discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately if you experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism of dichlorobenzyl alcohol's antiseptic action isn't fully understood.  However, it's believed to work by disrupting the proteins on the surface of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), thus damaging their cell structure and preventing their growth.  Its local anesthetic properties may also contribute to its effectiveness by reducing discomfort in the mouth and throat. The mild numbing effect can help alleviate pain associated with minor throat irritation.

*   **Children:**  Use caution when using lozenges containing dichlorobenzyl alcohol in young children, as they may have difficulty swallowing them, potentially leading to choking hazards.
