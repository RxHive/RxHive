# Daunorubicin (Liposomal)
### Generic Name
Daunorubicin (Liposomal)

### Usage
Daunorubicin liposomal is an anthracycline antineoplastic agent used primarily in the treatment of **advanced HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma**.  It's a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin, meaning the drug is encapsulated in liposomes (tiny fat bubbles) to improve its delivery to tumor cells. This formulation was designed to enhance the drug's penetration into solid tumors, potentially due to its smaller size and extended circulation time compared to conventional daunorubicin.  It's important to note that this formulation is distinct from conventional daunorubicin and should not be used interchangeably.  Daunorubicin liposomal is not recommended for non-advanced HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.  In the US, this medication was discontinued in July 2016.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  For advanced HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, the typical dosage is 40 mg/m² intravenously (IV) once every two weeks. Treatment continues until disease progression.  This dosage should be adjusted based on factors like hepatic and renal function (see Dosage Adjustments).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of daunorubicin liposomal in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1.2-3 mg/dL, administer 75% of the normal dose.  If the serum bilirubin level is >3 mg/dL, administer 50% of the normal dose.

* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with serum creatinine levels >3 mg/dL, administer 50% of the normal dose.

* **Obesity:**  The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines recommend using the patient's actual body weight for dosage calculations, particularly when aiming for a curative effect.  Toxicity management should follow the same protocols as for non-obese patients; if dose reduction is necessary, consider resuming full weight-based dosing in subsequent cycles if the cause of toxicity (e.g., hepatic or renal impairment) resolves.

* **Toxicity Management:** If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is <750/mm³, withhold treatment. For infusion reactions (back pain, flushing, chest tightness), temporarily interrupt the infusion.  The infusion may be resumed at a slower rate after the reaction subsides.

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, daunorubicin liposomal appears to work by directly binding to DNA (intercalation) and inhibiting DNA repair (through topoisomerase II inhibition). This action blocks DNA and RNA synthesis and leads to DNA fragmentation, ultimately inhibiting cancer cell growth.  The liposomal formulation is believed to improve the drug's delivery to tumor cells.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Daunorubicin liposomal is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components.

**Warnings:** This medication increases the risk of neutropenia (low white blood cell count), extravasation (leakage from the vein during infusion), infusion-related reactions, and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease).  It should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.  

**Boxed Warnings:** The manufacturer issued boxed warnings regarding bone marrow suppression (monitor blood counts and watch for infections), infusion reactions (monitor closely and interrupt infusion if necessary), and myocardial toxicity (regularly monitor cardiac function).

**Other Precautions:** Daunorubicin liposomal should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in cancer chemotherapy.  Patients with hepatic impairment require dose reduction.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks with their doctor; it's categorized as Pregnancy Category D.


### FAQs

**Q: How is daunorubicin liposomal administered?**
A: It is administered intravenously (IV) over one hour.  Do not mix it with other drugs or use an in-line filter.

**Q: What should I do if I experience an infusion reaction?**
A: Immediately inform your healthcare provider.  The infusion will likely be interrupted, and may be resumed at a slower rate after the reaction subsides.

**Q: How is daunorubicin liposomal stored?**
A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication packaging. Appropriate handling and disposal procedures should be followed.

**Q:  Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?**
A: Yes, numerous drug interactions are possible.  Discuss all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking with your healthcare provider or pharmacist to identify potential conflicts.
