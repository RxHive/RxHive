# Dasiglucagon
### Generic Name
Dasiglucagon

### Usage
Dasiglucagon is a medication used to treat severe hypoglycemia (dangerously low blood sugar) in adults and children aged 6 years and older who have diabetes.  Its primary use is to rapidly raise blood glucose levels in emergency situations where a person's blood sugar has dropped to a critical level, potentially causing loss of consciousness or seizures.  It's specifically designed for situations where other, faster-acting treatments aren't readily available or effective.

### Dosage

**Adults and Children ≥6 years:** For severe hypoglycemia, the subcutaneous (under the skin) dose is 0.6 mg. If blood sugar doesn't improve after 15 minutes, an additional 0.6 mg dose can be given using a new injection device.  Dasiglucagon is administered via a pre-filled injection pen.  Each dose requires a separate pen.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended based on hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment according to the manufacturer’s labeling.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea
* Pain at the injection site

**Rare Side Effects (<1% of patients):**

* Development of antibodies

**Other Side Effects (frequency not defined):**

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing)
* Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat)
* Presyncope (a feeling of faintness or lightheadedness)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dasiglucagon works by activating glucagon receptors in the liver. Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the liver to release stored glucose (sugar) into the bloodstream, thus raising blood sugar levels. Dasiglucagon mimics the action of glucagon, providing a quick source of glucose to combat severe hypoglycemia.  The effectiveness of Dasiglucagon depends on the presence of sufficient glycogen stores in the liver.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Dasiglucagon should not be used in patients with pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland) or insulinoma (a tumor in the pancreas that causes excessive insulin release).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency (underactive adrenal glands), chronic hypoglycemia, or starvation, as these conditions can affect the body's ability to respond to Dasiglucagon.
* Patients taking beta-blockers may experience a transient increase in pulse and blood pressure after Dasiglucagon administration.
* Dasiglucagon may lose its effectiveness, or even cause hypoglycemia, in patients taking indomethacin (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug).
* Dasiglucagon may increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin (a blood thinner).
* There is limited data on the safety of Dasiglucagon during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor.

**Important Safety Information:** Dasiglucagon is intended for subcutaneous injection only.  Do not reuse the injection device.  Administer fast-acting carbohydrates after treatment to restore glycogen levels and prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia.


### FAQs
