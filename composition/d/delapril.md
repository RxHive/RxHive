# Delapril
### Generic Name
Delapril

### Usage
Delapril is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily and reducing the pressure on artery walls.  While its primary indication is hypertension, it may also be considered in managing other conditions under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The usual starting dose for hypertension is 15-30 mg taken twice daily (BID).  The exact dosage will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response to treatment.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Delapril in children have not been established. It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with liver impairment, but caution is advised.  Your doctor will carefully monitor your condition and adjust the dosage as needed.  Delapril is available in oral tablet form.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Delapril include:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
* Persistent dry cough
* Other upper respiratory tract symptoms

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) â€“ Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* Blood disorders (e.g., neutropenia, agranulocytosis)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood)
* Skin rashes

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Delapril is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into active metabolites in the body.  These metabolites inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is an enzyme that plays a role in regulating blood pressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (substance that narrows blood vessels). By inhibiting ACE, Delapril reduces the formation of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and lower blood pressure.  Additionally, it reduces aldosterone secretion, promoting sodium and water excretion, further contributing to lower blood pressure.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Delapril is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Delapril or any other ACE inhibitor.
* History of angioedema caused by ACE inhibitors.
* Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.
* Pregnancy (especially the second and third trimesters).
* Aortic stenosis or other outflow tract obstructions.
* Active or suspected renovascular disease.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with:  renal impairment, liver impairment, collagen vascular disorders, hyperkalemia, volume depletion, peripheral vascular disease, generalized atherosclerosis, autoimmune diseases, congestive heart failure, elderly patients, before, during, or after major surgery, or in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis (un-stented).
* Monitor for angioedema, hyperkalemia, and neutropenia.
* Alcohol consumption should be avoided during therapy.
* Patients should avoid activities requiring alertness or coordination until they know how Delapril affects them.
* Potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium should only be used under a physician's supervision.
* Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions may occur.  Concomitant use with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and other drugs causing hyperkalemia (e.g., cyclosporine, indomethacin) may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Delapril?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Delapril, as it can increase the risk of low blood pressure and other side effects.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Delapril suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping Delapril or changing your dosage.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure.

* **Q: How should I store Delapril?** A: Store Delapril at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is Delapril safe during pregnancy?** A: Delapril is contraindicated in pregnancy, particularly during the second and third trimesters.  Discuss birth control options with your doctor.
