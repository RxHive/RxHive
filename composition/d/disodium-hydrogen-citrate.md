# Disodium Hydrogen Citrate

**Generic Name:** Disodium Hydrogen Citrate (also known as Disodium Citrate)

**Usage:** Disodium hydrogen citrate has several uses, depending on the formulation and concentration:

* **Food Additive (E331ii):**  It's a common food additive used as a buffer, emulsifier, and flavor enhancer. It helps regulate acidity and prevent spoilage. Found in a wide range of processed foods, beverages, and dairy products.
* **Pharmaceutical Ingredient:** Used in pharmaceutical formulations to adjust pH, enhance solubility of other drugs, and as a chelating agent (binds to metals). It's often included in oral medications and intravenous solutions.
* **Industrial Applications:**  Used in some cleaning products and industrial processes.


**Side Effects:**  Generally considered safe for consumption at levels typically found in food.  However, excessive ingestion can lead to:

* **Gastrointestinal upset:**  This includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. These effects are more likely with high doses.
* **Alkalosis (high blood pH):**  Large amounts can increase blood pH, potentially causing symptoms like dizziness, confusion, and muscle weakness. This is particularly relevant with intravenous administration.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, some individuals may experience allergic reactions, such as skin rash or itching.

**Note:**  The side effects listed are generally associated with significant overconsumption or inappropriate medical use. The amounts used in most foods pose minimal risk.  If experiencing any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.

**How it Works:** Disodium hydrogen citrate is a salt of citric acid. Citric acid is a weak acid, and when it's combined with sodium, it forms a salt that acts as a buffer. This means it can resist changes in pH.  The addition of sodium increases its buffering capacity.  Its ability to chelate (bind) metal ions is also utilized in various applications.  In pharmaceuticals, this chelation can improve drug stability and bioavailability.

**FAQs:**

* **Is disodium hydrogen citrate safe?**  Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory bodies when used in accordance with good manufacturing practices and at appropriate levels.
* **What is the difference between disodium hydrogen citrate and trisodium citrate?**  Both are salts of citric acid, but they differ in the number of sodium atoms. Trisodium citrate is more alkaline than disodium hydrogen citrate.
* **Can I take disodium hydrogen citrate if I have kidney problems?** Individuals with kidney problems should exercise caution and potentially consult their doctor before consuming high amounts of disodium hydrogen citrate, as the kidneys play a role in processing citrate.
* **Is disodium hydrogen citrate vegan and gluten-free?** Yes, disodium hydrogen citrate is naturally derived from citric acid and is generally considered vegan and gluten-free.
* **Where can I find disodium hydrogen citrate?** It is found in many processed foods, and is also available as a food-grade additive from chemical suppliers.  Pharmaceutical-grade versions are used in medicinal preparations.
