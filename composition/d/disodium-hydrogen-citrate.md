# Disodium Hydrogen Citrate
### Generic Name
Disodium Hydrogen Citrate

### Usage
Disodium hydrogen citrate is primarily used as a urinary alkalizer.  This means it helps to increase the pH (make it less acidic) of the urine.  Its main applications are:

* **Treatment of Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA):** RTA is a condition where the kidneys cannot properly acidify the urine, leading to a build-up of acid in the blood. Disodium hydrogen citrate helps to correct this imbalance.
* **Prevention of Uric Acid and Cysteine Stones:** By making the urine less acidic, it reduces the likelihood of these types of kidney stones forming.
* **Treatment of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):**  In some cases, it may be used to help treat UTIs, often in conjunction with other antibiotics.  The alkalinization of urine can create an environment less hospitable to certain bacteria.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.  Generally:

**Urine Alkalinization (Adult):**  15-30 mL (milliliters) orally, twice or three times daily (BID or TID).

**Urine Alkalinization (Pediatric):**
* Children under 7 years: 2 mL orally three times daily (TID).
* Children aged 7-12 years: 5 mL orally three times daily (TID).

**Important Note:**  The above dosages are examples and should not be interpreted as universally applicable.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs. The medication may be available in different forms (e.g., solution), and administration instructions will vary based on this.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, while generally mild, can include:

* Mild diuresis (increased urination)
* Stomach cramps
* Flatulence (gas)
* Diarrhea
* Gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration (less common but serious)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Metabolic alkalosis (high blood pH)
* Tiredness
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Anxiety
* Mood swings

Less common but more serious side effects are possible.  **If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Disodium hydrogen citrate works by increasing the pH of urine.  It does this by releasing citrate ions, which act as a buffer, neutralizing acids in the urine and raising its pH. This less acidic environment is beneficial in several ways: it prevents the formation of uric acid and cysteine kidney stones, facilitates the excretion of excess uric acid in individuals with gout, and can help to improve the effectiveness of certain treatments for renal tubular acidosis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Disodium hydrogen citrate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, hyperosmolar states (high concentration of solutes in the blood), severe hypertension (high blood pressure), edema (fluid retention), and those with hypersensitivity to dipotassium hydrogen citrate.
* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels), hypoventilation (inadequate breathing), alkalosis (high blood pH), renal disease, and pediatric patients (including neonates).  Its use during pregnancy and lactation should also be carefully considered.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Disodium hydrogen citrate may interact with other medications. It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **General Precautions:**  Always follow the prescribed dosage and instructions. Drink plenty of fluids while taking this medication to aid in its effect and prevent dehydration.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take disodium hydrogen citrate with food?**  A: It's generally recommended to take it with meals to minimize stomach upset.
* **Q: How should I store disodium hydrogen citrate?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Is disodium hydrogen citrate safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use should be guided by your physician, who will monitor your condition and adjust treatment as needed.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary recommendations while taking this medication?** A: Your doctor may advise on dietary adjustments based on your condition. Maintaining adequate hydration is typically recommended.
