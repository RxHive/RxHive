# Demeclocycline
### Generic Name
Demeclocycline

### Usage
Demeclocycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its primary use is against susceptible bacteria causing infections like acne, actinomycosis (a chronic bacterial infection), acute intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery), anthrax, cholera, clostridial diseases, certain gram-negative bacterial infections, listeriosis, inclusion conjunctivitis or trachoma (eye infections), plague, and relapsing fever.  Importantly,  it's also used off-label in managing the chronic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), a condition causing the body to retain too much water.  The effectiveness of demeclocycline against specific bacteria should always be confirmed through culture and sensitivity testing.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Susceptible infections:** The typical oral dosage is 150 mg four times daily (QID) or 300 mg twice daily (BID).  The specific dose and duration will depend on the severity and type of infection, as determined by a healthcare professional.
* **SIADH (off-label):** The oral dosage is 600-1200 mg per day.  This is an off-label use and requires careful monitoring by a physician.

**Children (â‰¥ 8 years):**

* **Susceptible infections:** The oral dose is usually 7-13 mg/kg/day, divided and given every 6-12 hours. The maximum daily dose is 600 mg.  Tetracyclines are generally avoided in children under 8 years old due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and a healthcare professional may recommend dose adjustments, such as reducing the dosage or increasing the interval between doses, in individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia (loss of appetite), and esophageal irritation.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These require immediate medical attention:

*   Pseudotumor cerebri (increased intracranial pressure)
*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (kidney's inability to concentrate urine)
*   Photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity)
*   Superinfections (new infections caused by other organisms)
*   Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*   Blood disorders (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia)


*This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any adverse effects.*

### How it Works

Demeclocycline is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria.  It achieves this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit (and possibly the 50S subunit) of bacterial ribosomes, thereby interfering with bacterial protein synthesis.  In the case of SIADH treatment, demeclocycline's mechanism is different; it acts by interfering with the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), reducing the body's ability to retain water.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Demeclocycline is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to demeclocycline, other tetracyclines, or any component of the medication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Demeclocycline can interact with several medications, including antacids, calcium supplements, iron supplements, and some oral contraceptives.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Demeclocycline is classified as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to a developing fetus. It should be avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. It is also excreted in breast milk and should not be used by breastfeeding mothers.
* **Children:** Use in children under 8 years old is generally avoided due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take demeclocycline with milk or antacids?** A: No, it's best to take demeclocycline 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals or milk, and avoid taking it with antacids, as these can decrease absorption.

* **Q: Can I take demeclocycline with alcohol?** A:  While not explicitly contraindicated, combining alcohol with demeclocycline may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol during treatment.

* **Q: How should I store demeclocycline?** A: Store demeclocycline in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
