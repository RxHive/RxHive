# Demeclocycline

**Generic Name:** Demeclocycline

**Usage:**

Demeclocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic used primarily for the treatment of:

* **Acne:**  Although less common now due to the availability of other, better-tolerated treatments.
* **Syphilis (secondary and latent):**  Used in conjunction with other antibiotics, particularly in penicillin-allergic individuals.  (Note: This use is becoming less frequent due to the emergence of penicillin-resistant strains.)
* **Rocky Mountain spotted fever:**  This is a serious tick-borne illness.
* **Certain bacterial infections:** It can be used to treat infections caused by susceptible bacteria, but its use is limited due to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance.
* **Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH):**  Demeclocycline affects the kidney's ability to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), making it useful in managing fluid retention in this condition.


**Side Effects:**

Like other tetracyclines, demeclocycline can cause a range of side effects, including:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight, leading to sunburn.
* **Superinfection:** Overgrowth of other microorganisms due to the disruption of normal gut flora.
* **Tooth discoloration:** In children whose teeth are still developing.  It is not usually prescribed for pregnant women or young children because of this risk.
* **Kidney problems:**  Increased risk of nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), especially with high doses or prolonged use.
* **Skin rash:**  Allergic reactions can occur.
* **Elevated BUN and Creatinine:**  These are markers of kidney function that can be elevated with demeclocycline use.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.

**How it Works:**

Demeclocycline works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.  It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain, thus stopping bacterial growth and replication.  In the case of SIADH, it interferes with the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the kidneys, reducing water reabsorption and promoting diuresis.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take demeclocycline with dairy products?** No. Dairy products and antacids interfere with the absorption of tetracyclines, reducing their effectiveness.
* **Should I take demeclocycline with food?**  It's generally recommended to take it with food to minimize gastrointestinal upset, but not with dairy products.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The time it takes to see improvement depends on the infection being treated.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking demeclocycline?**  Alcohol is generally not contraindicated unless other medical issues exist.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I take demeclocycline if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** Demeclocycline is generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the developing fetus and infant.
* **Is demeclocycline a broad-spectrum antibiotic?** Yes, it has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  However, due to widespread antibiotic resistance, its use is significantly limited.
