# Dalbavancin
### Generic Name
Dalbavancin

### Usage

Dalbavancin is a powerful antibiotic used primarily to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults.  ABSSSI refers to infections affecting the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and sometimes deeper structures like muscle and fascia.  This includes conditions like cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections. While not its primary indication, it may be used off-label in children for similar infections, but its safety and efficacy haven't been fully established in pediatric populations.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Dalbavancin is administered intravenously (IV).  There are two approved regimens:

* **Single-dose regimen:** 1500 mg infused over 30 minutes.
* **Two-dose regimen:** 1000 mg initially, followed by 500 mg one week later, each infused over 30 minutes.

Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).  For those with mild hepatic impairment, no adjustment is needed, but caution is advised for moderate or severe impairment.  

**Children:**  Dalbavancin is *not* FDA-approved for use in children.  However, off-label use is sometimes considered. Dosages in children, if used off-label, are determined based on weight and age and should only be administered under strict medical supervision.  The regimen may be similar to the adult regimen, but the dosage per kilogram of body weight will be significantly less.  Consult a pediatrician or infectious disease specialist for guidance on pediatric dosing.

**Important Note:** Always follow the prescribing information and your healthcare provider's instructions precisely.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache

### How it Works

Dalbavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic.  It works by binding to the cell walls of bacteria, interfering with their ability to build and maintain their protective outer layers.  This disruption ultimately leads to the death of the bacteria, effectively treating the infection.  Dalbavancin's unique structure allows it to remain active in the body for an extended period, explaining why it can be effective in a single or two-dose regimen.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Dalbavancin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to dalbavancin or any component of the formulation.  Caution is advised in patients with a history of glycopeptide allergy.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Dosage adjustments are needed for those with impaired kidney function; caution is recommended for those with moderate to severe liver impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of dalbavancin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Use during these periods should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks, under strict medical supervision.
* **Interactions:** Dalbavancin may interact with other medications, particularly live vaccines (BCG and Cholera) and some other drugs (estrogens, sodium picosulfate).  Discuss all medications you are taking with your healthcare provider before starting dalbavancin treatment.
* **Superinfection:**  Like other antibiotics, dalbavancin may cause superinfections (new infections caused by other organisms, such as yeast or other resistant bacteria).


### FAQs
