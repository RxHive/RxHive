**How it Works:**

Dapagliflozin belongs to a class of drugs called sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. It works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in the kidneys.  This protein normally reabsorbs glucose (sugar) from the blood back into the body. By blocking SGLT2, dapagliflozin allows the kidneys to excrete more glucose in the urine, lowering blood sugar levels.  This mechanism also leads to increased urination and fluid loss.
