# Dapagliflozin
### Generic Name
Dapagliflozin

### Usage

Dapagliflozin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's taken in addition to diet and exercise.  Importantly, it also plays a role in reducing the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes who have established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.  Furthermore, dapagliflozin is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction, regardless of whether they have type 2 diabetes.  Dapagliflozin is *not* used for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.  While not officially approved for these conditions, it's sometimes used off-label to manage diabetic kidney disease and as an adjunctive agent in proteinuric chronic kidney disease (even in those without type 2 diabetes).

### Dosage

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily (OD) in the morning, taken with or without food.  This may be increased to 10 mg OD if needed and tolerated for better glycemic control or to reduce heart failure hospitalization risk in patients with established CVD or multiple CV risk factors.

**Heart Failure (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction:** The dose is typically 10 mg OD.

**Diabetic Kidney Disease (off-label):** 10 mg OD, generally used in patients with significantly increased albuminuria (urinary albumin excretion >300 mg/day).

**Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease (off-label):** 10 mg OD, used as an add-on therapy to other treatments in patients with persistently elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (200-5000 mg/g), with or without type 2 diabetes.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dose adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.  However, renal impairment significantly impacts dosing. For type 2 diabetes management, dapagliflozin is generally not recommended if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is below 45 mL/min/1.73 m².  It's contraindicated if eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or if the patient is on dialysis. For heart failure, dosage recommendations for eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² are not supported by sufficient data; it is contraindicated for patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or those on dialysis.  The use in pediatric patients (under 18 years old) is not established.

### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

*   Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
*   Nausea
*   Dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid levels)
*   Hypovolemia (low blood volume)
*   Increased hematocrit (increased concentration of red blood cells)
*   Genitourinary fungal infections (yeast infections)
*   Influenza
*   Back pain
*   Limb pain
*   Dysuria (painful urination)
*   Increased urine output
*   Urinary tract infection


**Less Common but Serious:**

*   Bone fracture
*   Decreased eGFR
*   Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
*   Increased serum creatinine levels
*   Pyelonephritis (kidney infection)
*   Acute renal failure
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Angioedema (swelling under the skin)
*   Increased LDL cholesterol
*   Necrotizing fasciitis (rare, severe skin infection)
*   Severe dermatological reactions
*   Skin rash
*   Urinary tract infection with sepsis
*   Ketoacidosis (especially in patients with diabetes)


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Dapagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor.  SGLT2 is a protein in the kidneys that reabsorbs glucose from the bloodstream back into the body.  By blocking SGLT2, dapagliflozin prevents this reabsorption, leading to increased excretion of glucose in the urine. This lowers blood glucose levels. Additionally, it influences sodium reabsorption, potentially affecting blood pressure and other physiological functions that benefit patients with heart failure.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Dapagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction), severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²), or those on dialysis.
*   **Interactions:** Dapagliflozin may interact with other medications, particularly those affecting blood sugar levels (insulin, sulfonylureas).  Careful monitoring is necessary when taking dapagliflozin concurrently with other medications, such as alpha-lipoic acid, androgens, direct-acting antivirals, guanethidine, or agents affecting blood glucose. Close monitoring for hypoglycemia is vital if used with insulin or insulin secretagogues.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Dapagliflozin is generally not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and breastfeeding is not recommended due to the lack of data on excretion in breast milk.
*   **Renal Impairment:**  Close monitoring of kidney function is crucial, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
*   **Dehydration:**  Dapagliflozin increases urination, so adequate hydration is vital to prevent dehydration and hypotension (low blood pressure).
*   **Ketoacidosis:**  There is a risk of ketoacidosis (a serious metabolic complication), especially in patients with diabetes.  Monitoring for symptoms is essential.
*   **Infections:**  An increased risk of urinary tract infections and genital fungal infections has been observed.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take dapagliflozin with other diabetes medications?** A:  Yes, but it often requires careful dose adjustments of other medications (like insulin) to avoid hypoglycemia.  Your doctor will guide you on the appropriate combination.

*   **Q: How should I store dapagliflozin?** A: Store dapagliflozin as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

*   **Q: Is dapagliflozin safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term safety is generally considered acceptable under appropriate medical supervision and monitoring, with regular assessment of kidney function and other potential side effects.

*   **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking dapagliflozin?** A: While moderate alcohol consumption might be okay,  excessive alcohol can increase the risk of dehydration and hypoglycemia. Consult your doctor.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed as serious.
