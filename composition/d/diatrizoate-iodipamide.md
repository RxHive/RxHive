# Diatrizoate + Iodipamide
### Generic Name
Diatrizoate + Iodipamide

### Usage

Diatrizoate and Iodipamide is a combination of two contrast media agents used primarily in hysterosalpingography (HSG). HSG is a medical imaging procedure used to visualize the inside of the uterus and fallopian tubes.  This procedure helps assess the patency (openness) of the fallopian tubes, identify structural abnormalities within the uterus, and aid in the diagnosis of infertility or other reproductive issues. The diatrizoate and iodipamide mixture allows for better visualization of these structures during the X-ray procedure.


### Dosage

**Hysterosalpingography (Adult):**

*   The usual intrauterine dose is 3-4 mL, administered in fractional doses of approximately 1 mL at a time.
*   An additional 3-4 mL may be given to adequately visualize the fallopian tubes.
*   The total dosage range can vary from 1.5 mL to 10 mL, depending on the individual needs and the physician's assessment.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of Diatrizoate + Iodipamide in pediatric patients have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

The following side effects have been reported, although their exact frequency is not defined:

*   **Nervous System:** Chills, dizziness
*   **Cardiovascular:** Bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), syncope (fainting)
*   **Endocrine & Metabolic:** Thyroid dysfunction
*   **Gastrointestinal:** Abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting
*   **Hypersensitivity:** Anaphylactoid reactions (severe allergic reactions), other hypersensitivity reactions
*   **Other:** Fever

**Important Note:**  Serious, though less common, side effects can occur. If any adverse effects develop, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Diatrizoate and Iodipamide are iodine-containing contrast media. They work by increasing the radiodensity of the fluids within the uterus and fallopian tubes.  This increased density allows these structures to be clearly visible on X-ray images.  The contrast agents essentially make these areas show up more distinctly against the surrounding tissues, enabling a radiologist to assess their shape, size, and patency.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Hypersensitivity (allergy) to any component of the formulation.
*   Suspected pregnancy or within 6 months following pregnancy termination.
*   Infection of the external genitalia or genital tract.
*   Use during menstruation.
*   Use within 30 days of curettage (surgical scraping of the uterine lining) or conization (surgical removal of a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix).


**Warnings and Precautions:**

*   There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Emergency equipment should be readily available during and after the procedure.
*   Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disorder) as it may worsen the condition.
*   Use with caution in patients with uterine or fallopian tube cancer, as the procedure may potentially spread cancer cells.
*   Use with caution in patients with a history of reactions to contrast dyes or iodine-based contrast media or those with known clinical hypersensitivity.

**Drug Interactions:**

*   Aldesleukin may increase the risk of allergic reactions to iodinated contrast agents.
*   Iodinated contrast agents may increase the adverse effects of metformin.
*   Renal dysfunction caused by iodinated contrast agents may lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis.


### FAQs

**Q: How should I prepare for a hysterosalpingography using Diatrizoate + Iodipamide?**

A: Your doctor will provide specific instructions, but generally, you may need to have an enema and vaginal douche 1 hour before the procedure and empty your bladder beforehand. The procedure is typically scheduled 3-5 days after the end of your menstrual period.

**Q: What should I do if I experience a reaction during the procedure?**

A: Immediately inform the medical staff.  They are prepared to manage potential reactions.

**Q: Can I breastfeed after receiving Diatrizoate + Iodipamide?**

A: Diatrizoate meglumine is excreted in breast milk, so you should consult your doctor about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding after receiving this medication.

**Q: How is Diatrizoate + Iodipamide stored?**

A:  Store according to your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions, typically at room temperature and away from light and moisture.
