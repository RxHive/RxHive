# Dupilumab
### Generic Name
Dupilumab

### Usage

Dupilumab is a medication used to treat several inflammatory conditions.  Its primary use is in managing moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults and children aged 6 months and older who haven't responded well enough to topical treatments, or for whom topical treatments aren't suitable.

Beyond atopic dermatitis, Dupilumab is also used as an add-on maintenance therapy for:

*   **Moderate-to-severe asthma:** Specifically, it's used in adults and children 12 years and older (weighing at least 40 kg for eosinophilic esophagitis) with an eosinophilic phenotype (high eosinophil count in the blood) or those whose asthma is dependent on oral corticosteroids.  It's important to note that Dupilumab is *not* for treating acute asthma attacks or severe asthma emergencies (status asthmaticus).
*   **Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis:** This is an inflammatory condition affecting the sinuses and nasal passages, causing nasal congestion and polyps. Dupilumab is used as an add-on treatment in adults.
*   **Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE):** This is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the esophagus, causing difficulty swallowing and other digestive issues. Dupilumab is indicated for children 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg.


### Dosage

Dosage of Dupilumab varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation (subcutaneous injection).  **Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  The following is for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

*   **Atopic Dermatitis:** Typically, an initial dose of 600mg (two 300mg injections) is followed by 300mg every other week.
*   **Asthma:**  Dosage ranges from 200mg every other week to 300mg every other week depending on severity and whether the patient also has atopic dermatitis.  Higher doses (initially 600mg) might be used for severe asthma.  Minimum 4 months of treatment is suggested to assess efficacy.
*   **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis:** 300mg every other week.
*   **Eosinophilic Esophagitis:** 300mg once weekly.


**Children:**

Dosage for children varies greatly based on age, weight, and the condition being treated.  The starting dose, frequency, and maintenance dose will be determined by a physician.  Pediatric dosing for atopic dermatitis starts at 6 months of age.

**Important Note:**  Specific instructions for administration (subcutaneous injection) will be given by your healthcare provider.  Don't attempt to administer this medication without proper training.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include injection site reactions and the development of antibodies to the drug.

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis)
*   Increased risk of infection (including parasitic infections â€“ helminthiasis)
*   Eye problems (conjunctivitis, keratitis)
*   Joint pain (arthralgia)
*   Eosinophilia (increased eosinophil count)
*   Vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)

If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your doctor or other healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks the activity of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). These are signaling molecules involved in inflammatory processes in the body. By blocking IL-4 and IL-13, Dupilumab helps reduce inflammation and the associated symptoms of the conditions it treats.  The exact mechanism in asthma isn't completely understood, but it's believed to involve the dampening of inflammatory responses.


### Precautions

*   **Allergies:** Do not use Dupilumab if you are allergic to it or any of its components.
*   **Live Vaccines:**  Avoid live vaccines while taking Dupilumab, as this may increase the risk of infection.
*   **Other Medications:** Discuss with your doctor all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to check for potential interactions.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of Dupilumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your healthcare provider to weigh the benefits and risks.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Currently, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with liver or kidney problems.
