# Domperidone + Rabeprazole

**Generic Name:** Domperidone + Rabeprazole

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and other conditions involving excessive stomach acid and impaired gastric motility (the movement of food through the digestive system).  Domperidone helps to increase the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines, while Rabeprazole reduces the production of stomach acid.  It's commonly prescribed for symptoms like heartburn, acid reflux, nausea, and vomiting associated with GERD or other related disorders.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a physician based on the individual's condition and response to the medication.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Domperidone + Rabeprazole can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects can include:

* **From Domperidone:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, breast enlargement or milk production (galactorrhea), menstrual irregularities, and in rare cases, potentially serious heart rhythm problems (especially in higher doses or in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions).
* **From Rabeprazole:** Headache, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and rarely, more serious side effects like muscle pain, liver problems, and allergic reactions.

Less common and more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  Always consult a doctor if you experience unusual or concerning symptoms.


**How it Works:**

* **Domperidone:** This is a prokinetic agent. It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. This action promotes gastric emptying and reduces nausea and vomiting.  It also enhances the movement of food through the digestive tract.

* **Rabeprazole:** This is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It reduces the production of stomach acid by blocking the proton pump in the parietal cells of the stomach lining. This leads to a decrease in stomach acidity, relieving symptoms associated with excess acid.

The combination of these two drugs addresses both the acid production and motility issues often seen in GERD and related conditions.
