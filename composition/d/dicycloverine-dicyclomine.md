# Dicycloverine [Dicyclomine]
### Generic Name
Dicycloverine (also known as Dicyclomine)

### Usage
Dicycloverine is primarily used to relieve abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  It's an anticholinergic, meaning it works by blocking the action of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine in the body.  Acetylcholine plays a role in stimulating muscle contractions in the digestive tract. By blocking this action, dicycloverine helps to reduce gut spasms and the associated pain.  While its main use is for IBS-related abdominal pain, it may also be used off-label for other gastrointestinal motility disorders, particularly in children.  It's crucial to note that dicycloverine is not a cure for IBS or other gastrointestinal conditions, but rather a medication to manage symptoms.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Oral:** For abdominal pain associated with IBS, the typical starting dose is 20 mg four times a day (QID) for seven days. This may be increased to 40 mg QID as needed, but the maximum daily dose should generally not exceed 80 mg.  If no improvement is seen after two weeks, or if side effects are significant, the medication should be discontinued, or the dose should be reduced.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** In cases where oral medication is not feasible, a doctor may prescribe an initial dose of 10-20 mg QID for one to two days.  However, IM administration should be a short-term measure, with a switch to oral medication as soon as possible.  IM injection is contraindicated in the elderly population.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dicycloverine use in children should be closely monitored by a physician. Dosages vary significantly based on age and weight.

* **Infants (≥6 months) and Children (<2 years):** The oral dose is typically 5-10 mg three or four times a day (TID or QID), given 15 minutes before feeding. The maximum daily dose is 20 mg.
* **Children (≥2 years):**  The oral dose is typically 10 mg TID or QID.  The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.
* **Adolescents:**  The oral dose is typically 10-20 mg TID or QID. If there is no improvement after two weeks of treatment, the medication should be discontinued.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling, however, caution is advised in these cases.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before adjusting the dose.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These are experienced by a significant number of patients:

* Dizziness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Nausea
* Blurred vision

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Nervousness
* Weakness
* Constipation
* Confusion
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Difficulty urinating
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hallucinations (particularly in elderly patients)

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Dicycloverine is an anticholinergic drug that works by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic (M3) receptors in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. Acetylcholine normally causes these muscles to contract. By blocking acetylcholine, dicycloverine reduces the intensity and frequency of these contractions, thus relieving pain and discomfort associated with spasms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dicycloverine is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, obstructive diseases of the gastrointestinal or urinary tract, intestinal atony (especially in elderly or debilitated patients), severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon, myasthenia gravis, unstable cardiovascular status, breastfeeding, and infants under 6 months of age.  It's also contraindicated in those with a known hypersensitivity to dicycloverine or any of its components.
* **Interactions:** Dicycloverine can interact with other medications, such as other anticholinergic agents, antacids, cannabinoids, CNS depressants, gastroprokinetic agents, parasympathomimetics, potassium salts, topiramate, and zonisamide.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dicycloverine is categorized as a Pregnancy Category B drug.  However, other medications may be preferred for treating IBS in pregnant women. Dicycloverine is excreted in breast milk, therefore, it's contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers.
* **Elderly Patients and Children:**  Use caution when prescribing dicycloverine to elderly patients or young children due to increased risk of adverse effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking dicycloverine?** A: No. Dicycloverine can cause drowsiness and blurred vision, so avoid activities that require alertness.
* **Q: How should I store dicycloverine?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.
