# Diazoxide
### Generic Name
Diazoxide

### Usage
Diazoxide is primarily used to treat hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This condition occurs when the pancreas produces too much insulin, leading to dangerously low blood sugar levels.  Diazoxide is particularly effective in adults with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with extrapancreatic malignancy (cancer outside the pancreas) or inoperable islet-cell tumors (tumors within the pancreas). It's also used in infants and children with this condition, which can be linked to various factors like leucine sensitivity, islet-cell hyperplasia (enlarged pancreatic cells), nesidioblastosis (abnormal pancreatic cell development), extrapancreatic malignancy, or islet-cell adenomas/adenomatosis (benign or cancerous tumors).  Diazoxide may be used temporarily before surgery (preoperatively) and continued afterward (postoperatively) if the hypoglycemia persists.

In addition to its primary use, diazoxide has been used in the treatment of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises, although this use is less common.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia:** Oral administration is typical. The initial dose is usually 3 mg/kg/day, divided into three equal doses every 8 hours. This can be increased to 3-8 mg/kg/day, divided into two or three doses every 8-12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 15 mg/kg.  Doses may need to be higher in patients who don't respond to standard treatment.  If there's no improvement after 2-3 weeks, the medication should be discontinued.

* **Severe Hypertension/Hypertensive Crisis:**  Diazoxide is administered intravenously (IV) in these situations.  The initial dose is typically 150-300 mg given as a rapid injection (≤30 seconds) or a weight-based dose of 5 mg/kg as a rapid IV injection (≤30 seconds).  The maximum single dose is 300 mg. Additional doses may be necessary every 4-24 hours for severe or persistent hypertension, but the maximum daily dose is 1.2 g. In life-threatening cases, an initial dose of 600 mg may be considered.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage is weight-based and varies significantly depending on the age and condition of the child.  Always follow a physician's precise instructions.

* **Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia (Infants/Newborns):** Oral administration, with an initial dose of 10 mg/kg/day divided into three doses. The usual dose is 8-15 mg/kg/day divided into 2-3 doses.

* **Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia (Children):** Oral administration, with an initial dose of 3 mg/kg/day divided into three doses. The usual dose is 3-8 mg/kg/day divided into 2-3 doses; the maximum is 15 mg/kg/day.

* **Severe Hypertension/Hypertensive Crisis (Infants, Children, Adolescents):** IV administration. A dose of 5 mg/kg administered as a rapid IV injection (≤30 seconds) is typically used. The maximum single dose is 300 mg, and up to 4 doses (1200 mg) may be given within 24 hours.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, but a reduced dose may be considered in renal impairment due to the potential for prolonged half-life.

**Administration Guidelines:**  IV diazoxide should be administered undiluted and as a rapid injection directly into a vein. The patient should remain lying down for at least 30 minutes after the injection. Oral suspensions should be shaken well before administration and taken on an empty stomach.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These can vary in frequency and severity.

* Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, malaise
* Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia (rapid heart rate), palpitations, transient hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* Endocrine/Metabolic: Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), fluid retention,  hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)
* Dermatologic: Skin rash, hair loss
* Other:  Fever

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  These require immediate medical attention.

* Acute pancreatitis
* Cardiac failure
* Nonketotic hyperosmolar coma
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Pulmonary hypertension (especially in infants and neonates)
* Ketoacidosis
* Abnormal facial features (in children with chronic use)


Always consult a healthcare provider if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works

Diazoxide primarily works by inhibiting the release of insulin from the pancreas. This action helps raise blood glucose levels, counteracting the effects of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.  Additionally, diazoxide relaxes blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.  This vasodilatory effect contributes to its use in treating hypertension, although it's a less common application.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Diazoxide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to diazoxide, other thiazides, sulfonamide derivatives, or any formulation components. It's also contraindicated in patients with functional hypoglycemia and in hypertension secondary to mechanical abnormalities (e.g., aortic coarctation, arteriovenous shunt) for the IV formulation.
* **Warnings:**  Diazoxide should be used with caution in patients with hyperuricemia or gout, renal impairment, hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin levels in newborns), coronary or cerebral insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypotension, hypokalemia (low potassium levels), liver disease, or compensatory hypertension.  It's also used cautiously in neonates.  Close monitoring is crucial for patients with compromised cardiac reserve due to an increased risk of heart failure.
* **Interactions:** Diazoxide can enhance the effects of other antihypertensives and MAO inhibitors, potentially leading to excessive blood pressure lowering.  Close monitoring is necessary when used concurrently with these medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Diazoxide is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been established.  It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk; therefore, careful consideration is needed when breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store diazoxide?** A: Store diazoxide according to the label instructions, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking diazoxide suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking diazoxide abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can worsen the underlying condition.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of diazoxide?** A:  Long-term use of diazoxide can lead to several side effects, including hyperglycemia, hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth), and  fluid retention. Regular monitoring is necessary to assess for these effects.

* **Q: Is diazoxide safe for children?** A:  Diazoxide can be used in children under strict medical supervision, with dosage adjusted to their weight and condition.  However, close monitoring for side effects, particularly those affecting the heart and kidneys, is essential.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking diazoxide?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking diazoxide, as it can interact with the medication and potentially exacerbate side effects, particularly those related to blood pressure.  Always consult your physician.
