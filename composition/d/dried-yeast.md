# Dried Yeast
### Generic Name
Dried Yeast (Brewer's Yeast)

### Usage
Dried yeast, also known as brewer's yeast, has a long history of use in traditional medicine.  While it's not currently a mainstream pharmaceutical treatment for any specific condition, it's been used to address various ailments, including:

* **Diarrhea:**  Some believe it aids in relieving diarrhea symptoms, potentially by stimulating intestinal enzymes or combating intestinal bacteria.
* **Common Cold & Upper Respiratory Tract Infections:**  Traditional use suggests it may help boost the immune system to fight off these infections.
* **Influenza (Flu) & Swine Flu:** Similar to its use for the common cold, it's been suggested to support immune function during flu-like illnesses.
* **Loss of Appetite:** It's sometimes used as a nutritional supplement to potentially improve appetite.
* **Acne:**  Some believe it may have a positive impact on skin health.
* **High Cholesterol:**  Its potential cholesterol-lowering effects are a subject of ongoing research.
* **Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS):**  While not scientifically proven, it's been anecdotally linked to PMS symptom relief.
* **Recurring Boils:** Traditional uses suggest it could help with skin infections.
* **Type 2 Diabetes:**  The chromium content is believed to potentially improve insulin utilization and blood sugar control.


It's crucial to remember that these uses are largely based on traditional practices and anecdotal evidence, not extensive clinical trials.  The effectiveness of dried yeast in treating these conditions requires further scientific validation.

### Dosage
There is no universally established dosage for dried yeast as a medicinal treatment.  Dosage varies greatly depending on the intended use and the form of the supplement (e.g., tablets, powder, flakes).  Consult a healthcare professional or a qualified nutritionist to determine an appropriate dosage based on individual needs and health status.  They can help guide you toward a safe and effective amount, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.  Self-treating with dried yeast without professional guidance is not recommended.

### Side Effects
While generally considered safe for most people when taken in moderate amounts, dried yeast can cause some side effects. These include:

* **Gas and Bloating:** These are among the most common side effects.
* **Headache:** Less frequent, but possible.
* **Stomach Upset:**  Mild digestive discomfort can occur.
* **Allergic Reactions:** While rare, some individuals may experience allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, swelling).
* **Interactions with Medications:**  Dried yeast can potentially interact with certain medications; consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.


**Serious side effects are rare.** However, if you experience any unusual or severe symptoms after taking dried yeast, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works
The mechanisms through which dried yeast may exert its purported effects are not fully understood. However, several factors contribute to its potential benefits:

* **Nutrient Content:** Dried yeast is a rich source of B vitamins, chromium, and protein, which are essential for various bodily functions and overall health. The chromium may help improve insulin sensitivity, contributing to blood sugar control.
* **Immune System Support:** Some evidence suggests that certain components of yeast may stimulate the immune system, potentially helping to fight off infections.
* **Digestive Health:** Dried yeast may positively influence gut health, potentially through its impact on intestinal bacteria and enzyme activity.


It's important to note that the scientific evidence supporting these mechanisms is limited and requires further investigation.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Individuals with yeast allergies should avoid using dried yeast.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dried yeast may interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting blood sugar or blood clotting.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety and efficacy of dried yeast during pregnancy and breastfeeding are not well-established. Consult a healthcare provider before using it during these periods.
* **Underlying Health Conditions:**  Individuals with specific health conditions, such as kidney problems or compromised immune systems, should consult their doctor before using dried yeast.


Always follow the instructions on the product label and consult a healthcare professional before using dried yeast, particularly if you have any pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.
