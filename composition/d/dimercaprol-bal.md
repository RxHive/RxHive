# Dimercaprol (BAL)
### Generic Name
Dimercaprol (BAL)

### Usage
Dimercaprol, also known as British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a medication primarily used as an antidote for heavy metal poisoning.  Its main application is in the treatment of poisoning caused by arsenic, gold, and inorganic mercury.  While not a first-line treatment for lead poisoning, it's sometimes used as an adjunct to other chelating agents like EDTA (edetate calcium disodium) in severe cases or when lead encephalopathy is present.  Essentially, dimercaprol works by binding to heavy metals in the body, forming complexes that can then be excreted, thereby removing the toxic metals from the bloodstream and reducing their harmful effects.


### Dosage
Dimercaprol is administered via deep intramuscular (IM) injection.  Dosage varies significantly depending on the type and severity of the poisoning, as well as the patient's age and weight.  Premedication with a histamine H1 antagonist (like diphenhydramine) is typically recommended to mitigate potential side effects.

**Adult Dosage (IM):**

* **Arsenic or Gold Poisoning:** Dosage ranges from 2.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (mild) to 3 mg/kg every 4 hours (severe), with the frequency gradually reduced over several days (usually 10 days total).
* **Inorganic Mercury Poisoning (Acute):**  5 mg/kg initially, followed by 2.5 mg/kg 1-2 times daily for 10 days.
* **Lead Poisoning (Adjunct to EDTA):** 4 mg/kg every 4 hours for 2-7 days, usually at least 3 days, always in conjunction with EDTA, starting the EDTA with the second dose of dimercaprol.


**Pediatric Dosage (IM):**  Similar to adult dosages, but adjusted for weight.  Infants, children, and adolescents receive doses based on their weight, following the same frequency schedules as adults for each type of poisoning.  Note that for lead poisoning in children, dimercaprol is only used in conjunction with EDTA when blood lead levels are extremely high (â‰¥70 mcg/dL) or when encephalopathy is present.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The medication is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency (except in cases of arsenic-induced liver damage).  Renal impairment requires extreme caution, and treatment may need to be discontinued if acute renal insufficiency develops.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Increased blood pressure and heart rate
* Headache
* Pain at the injection site
* Fever
* Salivation
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Burning sensation in the mouth or throat

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Renal insufficiency (kidney failure)
* Hemolytic anemia (in patients with G6PD deficiency)
* Allergic reactions

Any unusual or persistent side effects require immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Dimercaprol is a chelating agent, meaning it binds to certain heavy metal ions, forming stable complexes. These complexes are then water-soluble, allowing them to be excreted from the body through the urine. By removing the heavy metal ions from their sites of action (like vital enzymes or cellular components), dimercaprol helps to alleviate the toxic effects of the heavy metals and prevent further damage.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Dimercaprol is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) insufficiency, unless the liver damage is directly caused by arsenic poisoning.
* **Interactions:** Avoid concomitant use with iron supplements, cadmium, selenium, or uranium, as dimercaprol can form toxic complexes with these substances.
* **G6PD Deficiency:** Use with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency due to the increased risk of hemolytic anemia.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dimercaprol is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been fully established.  Use during pregnancy should be weighed against the risks of heavy metal poisoning. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; careful consideration is needed for lactating mothers.
* **Pediatric Use:** Use in children requires careful monitoring due to the higher likelihood of fever.  Follow pediatric dosage guidelines strictly.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is dimercaprol administered?** A: It's given via deep intramuscular injection.
* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: Treatment duration depends on the type and severity of poisoning and usually lasts several days.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor immediately.  Some side effects may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of treatment.
* **Q: Can I store dimercaprol at home?** A: No, it's a prescription medication that requires proper storage under medical supervision.
* **Q: Is dimercaprol safe for everyone?** A: No, it's contraindicated in certain conditions and requires cautious use in others. Always discuss its suitability with your healthcare provider.
