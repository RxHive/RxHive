# Desflurane
### Generic Name
Desflurane

### Usage
Desflurane is a volatile, inhaled anesthetic used primarily for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia in adults.  It's also used for maintaining anesthesia in children, although induction in pediatric patients typically involves other agents before switching to Desflurane and intubation.  Its primary role is in surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia, providing a rapid onset and offset of anesthetic effect.

### Dosage
Desflurane dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors like patient response, age, and the specific surgical procedure. It's administered via a calibrated vaporizer designed specifically for Desflurane.

**Adults:**

* **Induction:**  Initial concentrations of 3% in oxygen or a nitrous oxide/oxygen mix are typically used, increasing in 0.5-1% increments every 2-3 breaths or as tolerated, aiming for end-tidal concentrations of 4-11%. Higher inspired concentrations (over 12%) have been used, but may necessitate reducing nitrous oxide or air.
* **Maintenance:**  Concentrations of 2.5-8.5% are generally used, often with nitrous oxide.

**Children:**

* **Maintenance:**  Concentrations of 5.2-10% are typically used, sometimes with nitrous oxide.  Dosage must be carefully adjusted based on the child's response.  Desflurane is *not* typically used for induction in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment, but cautious monitoring is vital.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Cough
* Breath-holding (apnea)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Decreased oxygen saturation
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure), including malignant hypertension
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Nodal arrhythmias
* Increased bronchial secretions
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Laryngospasm
* Malignant hyperthermia (rare but potentially life-threatening)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Desflurane's precise mechanism is not fully understood.  However, it's believed to work by enhancing the activity of inhibitory neurotransmitters (reducing neuronal activity) and inhibiting the action of excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, resulting in the induction of general anesthesia.  This leads to loss of consciousness, analgesia (pain relief), and muscle relaxation.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Desflurane or other halogenated anesthetics.
* Known or suspected genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia.
* Situations where general anesthesia is contraindicated.
* History of moderate-to-severe hepatic dysfunction following Desflurane or other halogenated anesthetic use.
* History of hepatitis due to a halogenated inhalational anesthetic.

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of malignant hyperthermia, respiratory depression, cardiovascular adverse effects (hypotension, coronary steal, tachycardia), increased intracranial pressure, perioperative hyperkalemia, hepatobiliary disorders, and pediatric neurotoxicity.  
* Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease, head injury, neuromuscular disorders, hepatic disease, or a risk of QT prolongation.  Exercise caution in elderly patients and children with asthma or recent upper respiratory infections.
* Desflurane can react with desiccated carbon dioxide absorbents, producing carbon monoxide.
* In children under 6 using a laryngeal mask airway, removal under deep anesthesia may increase adverse respiratory effects.

**Drug Interactions:**

* Desflurane enhances the effects of neuromuscular blockers and muscle relaxants.  
* It reduces the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of opioids and benzodiazepines.  Concomitant use requires careful monitoring.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Desflurane is categorized as a Pregnancy Category B drug.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take Desflurane to work?** A: The onset of action is relatively rapid, but the exact time depends on the concentration administered and individual patient factors.

* **Q: How is Desflurane stored?** A: Desflurane should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q:  Can I drive after receiving Desflurane?** A: No.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until fully recovered from the effects of anesthesia.  This is determined by your anesthesiologist.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed as serious.
