# Dorzolamide
### Generic Name
Dorzolamide

### Usage
Dorzolamide is primarily used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  It works by reducing the production of aqueous humor, the fluid within the eye that contributes to IOP. Lowering IOP is crucial in managing glaucoma, a condition that can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. While not a cure, Dorzolamide helps slow the progression of glaucoma and prevent further vision impairment.  It's important to note that Dorzolamide is typically used in conjunction with other glaucoma medications or procedures, depending on the severity of the condition.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the formulation of the medication. It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.  Generally, for both adults and children with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the recommended dosage is one drop of 2% Dorzolamide ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) three times daily.  There is no specific dosage adjustment for children; the same dosage as adults is used.  However,  adjustments may be necessary for patients with kidney impairment (see Precautions).  The medication is administered directly into the eye(s).  Always wash your hands before and after application. Avoid touching the tip of the container to the eye or any surface.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* Bitter taste
* Burning sensation, stinging, discomfort, or irritation in the eye
* Superficial punctate keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)


Less common, but still possible side effects include:

* Blurred vision
* Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
* Eyelid irritation
* Eye redness
* Excessive tearing (lacrimation)
* Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
* Dry eyes (xerophthalmia)
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Skin rash


Serious but rare side effects include:  angioneurotic edema, bronchospasm, choroidal detachment (following filtration procedures), contact dermatitis,  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and other allergic reactions.  If you experience any serious or unusual side effect, stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.  Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme found in the ciliary body of the eye, which is responsible for producing aqueous humor. By inhibiting this enzyme, Dorzolamide reduces the secretion of aqueous humor. Less aqueous humor means lower intraocular pressure, thus alleviating the pressure on the optic nerve in glaucoma patients.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Dorzolamide is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Dorzolamide or sulfonamides (sulfa drugs), and in patients with severe kidney impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).
* **Interactions:** Dorzolamide may interact with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.  The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may also increase Dorzolamide serum concentration. Consult with your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dorzolamide is categorized as pregnancy category C.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. The use in breastfeeding mothers should be carefully considered, weighing the benefits against the potential risk to the infant.
* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with low endothelial cell counts or hepatic impairment.  Patients should be advised to avoid contact between the dropper tip and the eye or surrounding structures.  If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, administer the drugs at least 5 minutes apart. Patients should remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Dorzolamide to work?** A:  The effects of Dorzolamide on IOP may not be immediately apparent. It typically takes several weeks to see the full therapeutic effect.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Dorzolamide if my eye pressure is normal?** A:  Do not stop taking Dorzolamide without consulting your doctor.  Even if your IOP is normal, continued treatment is often necessary to prevent further damage from glaucoma.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store Dorzolamide?** A:  Store Dorzolamide at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can Dorzolamide cause blurry vision?** A: Blurry vision is a possible side effect. If this occurs, it is usually temporary. However, if blurry vision persists or worsens, inform your doctor.
