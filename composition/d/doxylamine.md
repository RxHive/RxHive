# Doxylamine
### Generic Name
Doxylamine

### Usage
Doxylamine is primarily used for the short-term treatment of insomnia (difficulty sleeping).  It's also frequently found in combination with other medications to alleviate symptoms of nighttime allergies (allergic rhinitis) and upper respiratory tract infections (like the common cold).  The antihistamine properties help to reduce allergic symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes, making it particularly helpful for managing these symptoms at night.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, age, and the specific formulation of doxylamine.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Insomnia:**  The typical adult dose is 25 mg orally, taken 30 minutes before bedtime.
* **Allergic Rhinitis/Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (in combination products):** Doses typically range from 12.5 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, but this is highly dependent on the specific combination product.  Always follow the specific product instructions.  Maximum daily doses vary depending on the product and should be carefully followed.

**Children:**

Dosing for children is significantly more complex and varies greatly with age and weight.  **Never administer doxylamine to a child without first consulting a pediatrician.**  They will determine the appropriate dose based on the child's age, weight, and the condition being treated. Dosages are often calculated in mg/kg of body weight or mg/mÂ² of body surface area.

**Dosage Forms:** Doxylamine is available in tablets, capsules, and liquid formulations (syrups).

**Administration:**  Doxylamine is usually taken orally.  For some individuals, taking it with food may lessen gastrointestinal discomfort.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of doxylamine include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Headache
* Nausea


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
* Difficulty urinating
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


If you experience any serious side effects, stop taking doxylamine and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine that works by blocking histamine's action at H1 receptors in the body.  Histamine is a chemical involved in allergic reactions and wakefulness.  By blocking histamine, doxylamine reduces allergic symptoms and promotes sleepiness.  It also has anticholinergic effects which contribute to its sedative properties.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of doxylamine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before using doxylamine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Interactions with other medications:**  Doxylamine can interact with other medications, especially those that affect the central nervous system (CNS) such as sedatives, opioids, and alcohol.  This interaction can enhance drowsiness and other side effects.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking before starting doxylamine.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of doxylamine and are at higher risk for side effects.
* **Children:** The use of doxylamine in children should only be under the strict guidance of a pediatrician.
* **Glaucoma, urinary problems, or other specific conditions:** Individuals with glaucoma, enlarged prostate, or difficulty urinating should exercise caution when taking doxylamine due to its anticholinergic effects.


### FAQs
