# Droxicam
### Generic Name
Droxicam

### Usage
Droxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was used to reduce pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.  It's important to note that Droxicam has been withdrawn from the market due to a significantly increased risk of liver toxicity.  Therefore, it is no longer available for prescription or use.  Any information provided below is for historical and educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.

### Dosage
Because Droxicam is no longer available, specific dosage information is not relevant for current medical practice.  Previous formulations likely varied based on the specific condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  Dosage would have been determined and adjusted by a prescribing physician.

### Side Effects
While Droxicam is no longer available,  it's important to note that past reported side effects included:

*   Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, ulcers)
*   Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) â€“ this was a significant reason for its withdrawal.
*   Skin reactions (e.g., rash, itching)
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Fluid retention

**Serious, but less common side effects** could have included severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), kidney problems, and cardiovascular complications.  If any adverse effects occurred, immediate consultation with a healthcare provider would have been essential.

### How it Works
Droxicam is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, piroxicam, after ingestion. Piroxicam works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for producing prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and inflammation. By reducing prostaglandin production, piroxicam helps alleviate pain and reduce swelling in the joints.

### Precautions
Given Droxicam's withdrawal from the market due to hepatotoxicity,  detailed precautions are largely historical. However, it's crucial to remember that NSAIDs generally require caution in individuals with:

*   Pre-existing liver or kidney disease.
*   History of stomach ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.
*   Heart conditions.
*   Pregnancy or breastfeeding (as with all medications, a physician's guidance is crucial during these periods).
*   Individuals taking other medications, as drug interactions were a possibility.
