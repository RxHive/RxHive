# Demecarium
### Generic Name
Demecarium

### Usage
Demecarium bromide is primarily used in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, a condition characterized by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) that can damage the optic nerve. It's also employed in the diagnosis and management of accommodative convergent strabismus (a type of eye misalignment).  While its primary use is ophthalmic (eye-related), it's crucial to remember that this medication is a potent cholinesterase inhibitor, and systemic effects are possible. Therefore, its use is reserved for cases where other treatments have proven insufficient.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** Demecarium dosage must be carefully adjusted for each patient, starting with low doses and closely monitoring the response.  The initial period requires close observation due to the potential for significant side effects. If a sufficient response isn't seen within 24 hours, alternative therapies should be considered.  The information below provides general guidelines; actual dosages are determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs.

**Ophthalmic Solution (0.125% or 0.25%):**

* **Open-angle glaucoma (Adults and Children):**  Typically, 1-2 drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) anywhere from twice daily to twice weekly. The frequency is highly individualized and dependent on the patient's response and IOP.  Regular monitoring of IOP is crucial, especially initially (at least hourly for 3-4 hours).

* **Accommodative convergent strabismus (Adults):**  Dosage varies depending on whether it's used for diagnosis or treatment.  For diagnosis, the regimen might involve 1 drop in each eye daily for two weeks, followed by 1 drop every other day for 2-3 weeks. For treatment, it could start with daily drops for 2-3 weeks, reducing to every other day and then gradually decreasing frequency based on the patient's response. The patientâ€™s condition is regularly reevaluated.

* **Accommodative convergent strabismus (Children):**  Dosage generally follows the adult guidelines for diagnosis, but close monitoring is essential due to the potential for increased side effects in children.

**Administration:**  The solution should be instilled into the conjunctival sac (the space between the eyelid and eyeball).  Gentle pressure on the lacrimal sac (the tear duct) immediately after instillation helps minimize systemic absorption.  Hands should be washed immediately following administration.  Contact lenses should be removed before application and reinserted at least 15 minutes afterward.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Brow ache
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Hypersalivation (excessive saliva)
* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye
* Lid muscle twitching
* Eye redness
* Blurred vision (induced myopia)
* Increased intraocular pressure (paradoxical effect)
* Cataract formation (long-term use)
* Iritis (inflammation of the iris)
* Uveitis (inflammation of the uvea)
* Urinary incontinence
* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  It's vital to seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe or concerning symptoms.


### How it Works
Demecarium is a cholinesterase inhibitor, meaning it blocks the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.  By preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine, Demecarium prolongs its effects, leading to increased activity in the parasympathetic nervous system. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (miosis) and the ciliary muscle, ultimately facilitating the outflow of aqueous humor and lowering intraocular pressure.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Demecarium is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, active uveal inflammation, glaucoma associated with iridocyclitis, and pregnancy (Category X).

**Warnings and Precautions:**  Demecarium should be used with caution in individuals with:

* Conditions that could be worsened by vagotonic effects (e.g., asthma, peptic ulcers, bradycardia, hypotension, recent myocardial infarction, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease).
* Exposure to organophosphate insecticides/pesticides.
* Intraocular inflammation.
* Myasthenia gravis.
* Narrow-angle glaucoma or narrow angles.

Surgery:  Demecarium should be discontinued before surgery because long-term use can increase the risk of hyphema (bleeding in the eye).


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Demecarium?** A:  The response time varies, but effects on IOP are often observed within 24 hours.  However, full therapeutic benefit might take longer to achieve.

* **Q: How should Demecarium be stored?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I use Demecarium with other eye drops?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist. Interactions with other medications, especially other cholinesterase inhibitors or eye drops, are possible.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the dose; simply continue with the prescribed schedule.

* **Q: Can I drive after using Demecarium?** A:  Blurred vision is a potential side effect. Avoid driving or operating machinery until your vision clears.

* **Q: Is Demecarium safe for pregnant women?** A: No, it is contraindicated during pregnancy.

* **Q: Is Demecarium safe for breastfeeding mothers?** A: Excretion in breast milk is unknown; a healthcare professional must weigh the benefits and risks.
