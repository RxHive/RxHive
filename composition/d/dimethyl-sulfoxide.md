# Dimethyl Sulfoxide
### Generic Name
Dimethyl Sulfoxide

### Usage

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of interstitial cystitis (IC), a chronic bladder condition causing pelvic pain and urinary urgency and frequency.  It's administered directly into the bladder (intravesically) for this purpose.  Importantly, DMSO is *not* effective against bacterial urinary tract infections.

Off-label, DMSO is used topically to manage extravasationâ€”the leakage of a medication (such as certain chemotherapy drugs like anthracyclines, mitomycin, or mitoxantrone) from a vein into the surrounding tissue.  In this case, it helps to minimize tissue damage.

### Dosage

**Interstitial Cystitis (Intravesical):**

* **Adults:**  The typical dose involves instilling 50 mL of DMSO directly into the bladder via catheter.  The solution is retained for 15-20 minutes.  Treatment frequency varies; some protocols suggest repeating every 2 weeks until symptom relief, then increasing intervals. Other protocols recommend 4-8 treatments at 1-2 week intervals.  Specific treatment duration and frequency should be determined by a healthcare professional.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of DMSO for interstitial cystitis in children have not been established.

**Extravasation Management (Topical, Off-label):**

* **Adults:** Apply DMSO topically to an area twice the size of the extravasation site. Treatment should begin within 10 minutes of the extravasation event. Apply every 8 hours for 7 days. Do not cover the treated area with a dressing.

* **Children:**  Dosage and safety in children for extravasation management are not established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Body odor
* Halitosis (bad breath) or unpleasant taste
* Transient bladder pain or cystitis (inflammation of the bladder)
* Localized erythema (redness)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Contact dermatitis
* Eosinophilic cystitis (a specific type of bladder inflammation)
* Pigment deposits on the lens of the eye (potentially leading to vision problems)

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

For interstitial cystitis, DMSO's mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work through its anti-inflammatory, analgesic (pain-relieving), and mast cell-inhibiting properties.  These actions help reduce the bladder inflammation and pain associated with IC.

In extravasation management, DMSO acts as a free radical scavenger.  It helps remove the extravasated (leaked) medication from the surrounding tissue, minimizing tissue damage and reducing the severity of the adverse reaction.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  While no specific contraindications are listed by manufacturers, caution is advised in patients with urinary tract malignancies (cancers) and those with cataracts (clouding of the eye's lens).

* **Drug Interactions:** DMSO can interact with some medications.  Specifically, it may decrease the effectiveness of dexrazoxane (a cardioprotective agent) and alter the metabolism of sulindac (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug).  Discuss all medications with your doctor before using DMSO.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** DMSO is classified as a Category C drug in pregnancy. This means the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  Its excretion in breast milk is also unknown.  DMSO should be used during pregnancy or lactation only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Other Precautions:** Be aware that DMSO may cause transient chemical cystitis (bladder irritation) and bladder discomfort. It can also alter your sense of taste.  Regular eye exams might be necessary during long-term use due to potential lens changes.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for DMSO to work for interstitial cystitis?** A: The onset of relief varies, with some patients experiencing improvement within a few treatments, while others may require a longer course of therapy.

* **Q: How should I store DMSO?** A: Store DMSO as directed by your healthcare provider or the product labeling.

* **Q: Can I use DMSO for any other conditions besides IC and extravasation?** A: No, using DMSO for unapproved conditions is not recommended.  Its use should be restricted to those approved by your healthcare provider.

* **Q: Is DMSO safe?** A:  DMSO is generally considered safe when used appropriately and as directed by a healthcare professional.  However, like all medications, it can cause side effects.  It's crucial to follow all instructions and report any adverse reactions promptly.
