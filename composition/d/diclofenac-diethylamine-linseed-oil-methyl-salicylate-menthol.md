# Diclofenac diethylamine + Linseed Oil + Methyl Salicylate + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac Diethylamine + Linseed Oil + Methyl Salicylate + Menthol (This is a combination product, not a single generic name.)


**Usage:** This combination topical analgesic is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Osteoarthritis
* Soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains)
* Back pain
* Muscle aches


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site. They can include:

* Skin irritation (redness, itching, burning, rash)
* Swelling at the application site
* Allergic contact dermatitis (in sensitive individuals)
* Rarely, systemic effects are possible if a large amount is absorbed through the skin, mimicking the side effects of oral diclofenac (e.g., gastrointestinal upset, headache).


**How it Works:** This combination product works through a synergistic effect of its components:

* **Diclofenac Diethylamine:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits the production of prostaglandins, reducing pain and inflammation.
* **Linseed Oil:**  A source of omega-3 fatty acids which may have anti-inflammatory properties and help improve skin hydration. It may also act as a penetration enhancer for other ingredients.
* **Methyl Salicylate:**  A counterirritant that produces a warming sensation, distracting from pain and potentially improving blood flow to the affected area.
* **Menthol:** A counterirritant that produces a cooling sensation, also providing distraction from pain.
