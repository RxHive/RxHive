# Deutetrabenazine
### Generic Name
Deutetrabenazine

### Usage
Deutetrabenazine is primarily used to treat two movement disorders:

*   **Chorea associated with Huntington's disease:** Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder causing progressive nerve cell damage in the brain.  Chorea is a symptom characterized by involuntary, jerky movements. Deutetrabenazine helps reduce the severity of these movements.

*   **Tardive dyskinesia:** This is a neurological syndrome that causes repetitive, involuntary movements, typically of the face, mouth, and tongue. It often develops as a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications. Deutetrabenazine helps manage these involuntary movements.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage should always be determined and adjusted by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response to treatment.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults (Chorea associated with Huntington's disease):**

*   Initial dose: 6 mg once daily (OD).
*   The dose may be increased in weekly increments of 6 mg/day, up to a maximum of 48 mg/day, depending on response and tolerability.
*   If the total daily dose is 12 mg or more, it should be divided into two doses.

**Adults (Tardive dyskinesia):**

*   Initial dose: 6 mg twice daily (BID).
*   The dose may be increased in weekly increments of 6 mg/day, up to a maximum of 48 mg/day, depending on response and tolerability.
*   If the total daily dose is 12 mg or more, it should be divided into two doses.

**Switching from Tetrabenazine:** A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate starting dose of deutetrabenazine based on the previous tetrabenazine dosage.  A gradual transition is typically recommended.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of deutetrabenazine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in individuals with renal impairment or those taking certain other medications (see Precautions).  Deutetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Drowsiness
*   Fatigue
*   Insomnia
*   Anxiety
*   Depression
*   Agitation
*   Akathisia (restlessness)
*   Suicidal ideation
*   Diarrhea
*   Dry mouth (xerostomia)
*   Constipation
*   Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
*   Bruising


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Sedation
*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) – a rare but serious condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability. Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur.
*   QTc prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm) – requires cardiac monitoring.
*   Parkinsonism (symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease) – particularly in patients with Huntington's disease.


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor. VMAT2 is a protein that helps move monoamines (neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine) into storage vesicles within nerve cells. By inhibiting VMAT2, deutetrabenazine reduces the amount of these neurotransmitters available for release, which helps to lessen the involuntary movements associated with chorea and tardive dyskinesia.  The exact mechanism by which this leads to improvement in these conditions isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be related to modulation of dopamine signaling in the brain.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Deutetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment, those who are suicidal or have untreated or inadequately treated depression (especially in those with Huntington's disease), and those concurrently taking tetrabenazine or valbenazine, or within 14 days of discontinuing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 20 days of discontinuing reserpine.

*   **Drug Interactions:**  Deutetrabenazine is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2D6.  Taking it with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (like some antidepressants) can increase deutetrabenazine levels, potentially increasing side effects.  The dosage may need to be adjusted in these cases.  Also, avoid concurrent use of alcohol or other sedatives due to the potential for additive sedative effects.

*   **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in older adults and carefully consider the risk-benefit profile.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding: The effects on pregnancy and breastfeeding are not fully known.  Discuss these risks with your doctor.

*   **Suicidal Ideation:**  There is an increased risk of depression and suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients with Huntington’s disease taking deutetrabenazine. Close monitoring is necessary.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take deutetrabenazine with other medications?**  A:  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, to avoid potential interactions.

*   **Q: How should I store deutetrabenazine?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Follow the specific storage instructions on the label.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking deutetrabenazine suddenly?**  A: No, do not stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may lead to worsening symptoms or withdrawal effects.

*   **Q:  Is deutetrabenazine addictive?** A:  Deutetrabenazine is not considered an addictive substance. However,  it is important to follow your doctor's instructions and not alter the dosage or stop taking it without their approval.
