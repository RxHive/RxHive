# Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride

**Usage:**  This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu, specifically coughs and runny noses.  The diphenhydramine acts as an antihistamine to dry up nasal secretions, and the ammonium chloride acts as an expectorant to help loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.  It's important to note that this combination is less common now than in the past, with newer, more targeted medications often preferred.  It might still be available in some formulations, particularly older ones.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of diphenhydramine.
* **Dry mouth:** Both ingredients can contribute to this.
* **Constipation:**  Can be caused by the antihistamine effect.
* **Nausea:** Less common, but possible.
* **Headache:**  Possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Another potential side effect.
* **Blurred vision:** Less common, but possible.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though rare, allergic reactions are possible, ranging from mild skin rashes to more severe reactions.

**How it Works:**

* **Diphenhydramine (antihistamine):**  It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or response to a cold/flu virus.  By blocking histamine, it reduces runny nose and sneezing. It also has mild anticholinergic effects which contribute to drying up secretions.
* **Ammonium Chloride (expectorant):**  It works by increasing the amount of fluid in the respiratory tract. This helps to thin the mucus, making it easier to cough up.  It does this by slightly increasing the acidity of the bronchial secretions.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this medication habit-forming?** A:  While not physically addictive like opioids, prolonged use of diphenhydramine can lead to tolerance, meaning you might need higher doses to achieve the same effect.  It's not recommended for long-term use without a doctor's supervision.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  No. Combining alcohol with diphenhydramine can significantly increase drowsiness and other side effects.

* **Q:  Can I drive while taking this medication?** A:  No.  The drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine can impair your ability to drive safely. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q:  What should I do if I take too much?** A:  Contact your doctor or poison control immediately.  Overdosing on diphenhydramine can be dangerous.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: Yes,  diphenhydramine can interact with various medications, including other antihistamines, sedatives, and certain antidepressants.
