# Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride
### Generic Name
Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu, particularly those involving a cough with mucus production and nasal congestion.  Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, helps to dry up runny noses and reduce nasal congestion. Ammonium chloride, an expectorant, thins the mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  Therefore, the combination aims to alleviate both the dry and productive cough symptoms often associated with upper respiratory infections.  It's important to note that this combination doesn't treat the underlying infection itself (like a virus) but manages the bothersome symptoms.

### How it Works

Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes inflammation and allergy symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.  Ammonium chloride acts as an expectorant. It increases the fluid content of respiratory tract secretions, making the mucus less viscous and easier to expel through coughing.  The combination addresses both the drying and productive aspects of a cough and associated upper respiratory symptoms.
