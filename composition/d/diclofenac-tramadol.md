# Diclofenac + Tramadol

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Tramadol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve moderate to severe pain, particularly pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-surgical pain.  It combines a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, with an opioid analgesic, tramadol.  Diclofenac reduces inflammation and pain, while tramadol relieves pain by acting on opioid receptors in the brain.  **It is important to note that this is a prescription medication and should only be used as directed by a doctor.**  It is not suitable for all types of pain and should not be used long-term without close medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual, dosage, and duration of use. Common side effects can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, stomach pain, ulcers (rare but serious)
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, lightheadedness, confusion, fatigue
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased blood pressure, increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with prolonged use)
* **Other:**  Sweating, itching, rash, difficulty sleeping, dry mouth


**Serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, include:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe stomach pain
* Bloody or black stools
* Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice)
* Seizures
* Signs of liver or kidney damage


**How it Works:** Diclofenac inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and pain. Tramadol acts on opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord to reduce pain perception. The combination provides a stronger analgesic effect than either drug alone.
