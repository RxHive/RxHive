# Dextrothyroxine

**Generic Name:** Dextrothyroxine sodium

**Usage:**  Dextrothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).  It's less commonly used than levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levothroid) and is generally reserved for patients who haven't responded well to levothyroxine or have specific needs.  Some studies suggest it may have benefits in treating hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) as well, though this is not a widely accepted or FDA-approved use.  Importantly, dextrothyroxine is **not** interchangeable with levothyroxine and should only be used under the strict guidance of a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are similar to those of levothyroxine and can include:

* **Common:** Headache, nervousness, insomnia, increased sweating, tremors, palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat), increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, menstrual irregularities.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), angina (chest pain), osteoporosis (increased risk of fractures).  High doses can lead to hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) with symptoms such as increased heart rate, anxiety, weight loss, and heat intolerance.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing can occur.

**How it Works:**  Dextrothyroxine is a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone.  While levothyroxine is the levo isomer of T4, dextrothyroxine is the dextro isomer.  The exact mechanism by which it improves hypothyroidism is not fully understood, but it is believed to interact differently with thyroid hormone receptors compared to levothyroxine.  Some research suggests it may have additional effects beyond simply replacing thyroid hormone, potentially explaining its sometimes observed benefits in lipid profiles.  However, more research is needed to fully elucidate its mechanism of action.

**FAQs:**

* **Is dextrothyroxine better than levothyroxine?**  There is no conclusive evidence that dextrothyroxine is superior to levothyroxine for treating hypothyroidism.  Levothyroxine is the standard and more widely studied treatment.  Dextrothyroxine is generally considered a second-line option.
* **Can I switch from levothyroxine to dextrothyroxine?**  No, you should not switch medications without consulting your doctor.  The two are not interchangeable, and dosage adjustments are complex and require careful monitoring.
* **Is dextrothyroxine available everywhere?**  It is less widely available than levothyroxine and may not be carried by all pharmacies.  Your doctor or pharmacist can help determine availability in your area.
* **What are the potential risks of taking dextrothyroxine?**  As with any medication, there are potential risks, including those listed in the side effects section.  Regular monitoring by a physician is essential.
* **Is dextrothyroxine covered by insurance?**  Insurance coverage can vary; it's best to check with your insurance provider.
