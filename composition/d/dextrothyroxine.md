# Dextrothyroxine
### Generic Name
Dextrothyroxine

### Usage
Dextrothyroxine's primary use is in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol).  It works by lowering both total serum cholesterol and LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels. While not its primary indication, it's worth noting that dextrothyroxine is a synthetic thyroid hormone and shares some structural similarities with levothyroxine (T4).  However, it's crucial to understand that dextrothyroxine is **not** typically used to treat hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).  Its effect on cholesterol is its main therapeutic benefit.

### Dosage

**Adults (Hypercholesterolemia):**  Dextrothyroxine is administered orally.  The initial dose is typically 1-2 mg per day. This dose is gradually increased in increments of 1-2 mg per day at intervals of no less than one month, until the desired cholesterol reduction is achieved (monitored via blood tests). The maintenance dose usually falls within the range of 4-8 mg per day, although the maximum recommended daily dose is also 4-8 mg/day.  Individual response varies, and dosage adjustments are determined based on cholesterol levels and patient tolerance.


**Children (Hypercholesterolemia):** Oral administration is used for children as well.  The starting dose is 0.05 mg/kg/day.  This can be doubled after a month, and further adjustments (in increments of 0.05 mg/kg/day) can be made monthly, as needed, based on the child's response and blood tests. The maximum daily dose for children is 4 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's label doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised in these populations, and close monitoring is essential.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of dextrothyroxine can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Angina pectoris (chest pain)
* Extrasystoles (premature heartbeats)
* Ectopic beats (irregular heartbeats)
* ECG changes suggesting myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart)
* Cardiomegaly (enlarged heart)
* Supraventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)

If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Dextrothyroxine lowers cholesterol primarily by increasing the liver's conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. These bile acids are then eliminated from the body via the feces. This process is believed to be mediated through the stimulation of 7-alpha-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in bile acid synthesis.  Essentially, it helps the body get rid of excess cholesterol.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dextrothyroxine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to dextrothyroxine or its components.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with pre-existing heart disease, a history of heart attack, or other cardiovascular conditions are at increased risk for adverse cardiac events.  Similarly, there's an increased risk of gastrointestinal issues and potential for hyperthyroidism at higher doses.  The possibility of osteoporosis should be considered.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with anticoagulants (blood thinners) may increase bleeding risk. The effectiveness of dextrothyroxine might be reduced if taken with kelp, seaweed, or other products containing iodine.
* **Caution:**  Exercise caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment and in those with a history of iodism (iodine poisoning).  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using dextrothyroxine.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dextrothyroxine with food?** A:  Yes, dextrothyroxine can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see a reduction in cholesterol levels varies from person to person, but it typically takes several weeks or months, requiring regular blood tests to monitor progress.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store dextrothyroxine?** A: Store dextrothyroxine as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Is dextrothyroxine suitable for treating hypothyroidism?** A: No, dextrothyroxine is not typically used to treat hypothyroidism.  Levothyroxine is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism.

* **Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with taking dextrothyroxine?** A:  Long-term use requires regular monitoring for potential side effects, particularly cardiac and thyroid-related issues. Consult your doctor for a personalized risk assessment.
