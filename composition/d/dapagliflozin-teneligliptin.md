# Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin

**Generic Name:** Dapagliflozin/Teneligliptin

**Usage:**

Dapagliflozin/Teneligliptin is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It's often prescribed when lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) and other medications haven't been enough to control blood sugar levels.  It may be used alone or in combination with other diabetes medications.  The specific dosage and usage instructions will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and health conditions.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Increased urination is a common effect of dapagliflozin, which increases the risk of UTIs.
* **Genital yeast infections (candidiasis):**  More frequent in women.
* **Dehydration:** Due to increased urination.
* **Nausea:** Relatively common.
* **Constipation or diarrhea:** Can vary between individuals.
* **Headache:** Relatively common.
* **Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia):** More likely when combined with other diabetes medications, particularly insulin or sulfonylureas.
* **Ketoacidosis:**  A serious complication, though rare, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes, or those with severe kidney disease or who are dehydrated.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing.
* **Fractures:** Some studies suggest a possible increased risk.
* **Leg or foot amputations:**  Some studies have shown a potential increased risk in this specific patient population.

**How it Works:**

This combination medication works in two ways:

* **Dapagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor):** This component works by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys. This means more glucose is excreted in the urine, leading to lower blood sugar levels.
* **Teneligliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor):** This component works by increasing the release of incretin hormones, which stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion. This results in improved blood sugar control.  By combining these two mechanisms, the medication aims for better glucose control than either component would achieve alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Dapagliflozin/Teneligliptin if I have kidney disease?**  A:  Its use may be adjusted or contraindicated depending on the severity of kidney disease.  A doctor needs to assess kidney function before prescribing.
* **Q: Can I take Dapagliflozin/Teneligliptin if I have heart problems?** A:  This medication may be beneficial for some patients with heart problems, but its use should be carefully considered and monitored by a doctor.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Dapagliflozin/Teneligliptin?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally fine, but excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of hypoglycemia and dehydration.  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Dapagliflozin/Teneligliptin suddenly?** A: No.  Stop taking the medication only under the guidance of your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation could lead to adverse effects.
