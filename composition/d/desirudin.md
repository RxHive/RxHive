# Desirudin
### Generic Name
Desirudin

### Usage
Desirudin is a medication primarily used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the subsequent risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery.  DVT is the formation of blood clots in the deep veins, usually in the legs, while PE is a serious condition where a blood clot travels to the lungs.  Desirudin's role is prophylactic; it aims to prevent these clots from forming in the first place, reducing the risk of these potentially life-threatening complications during and after hip surgery.  Currently, it is not approved for other uses.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For DVT prophylaxis before elective hip replacement surgery, the usual subcutaneous (SubQ) dose is 15 mg every 12 hours. The first dose can be given up to 5-15 minutes before surgery (after regional anesthesia induction, if used).  Treatment typically lasts up to 12 days.  The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be monitored. If the aPTT exceeds twice the control value, the medication should be stopped until the aPTT returns to below twice the control value; then, treatment can resume at a reduced dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with kidney problems.  For those with moderate impairment (creatinine clearance ≥31 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), the starting dose is 5 mg every 12 hours.  For those with severe impairment (creatinine clearance <31 mL/min/1.73 m²), the starting dose is 1.7 mg every 12 hours.  Monitoring of aPTT is crucial, and the same interruption and dose reduction guidelines as above apply. Desirudin is dialyzable.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment; however, caution is advised.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of desirudin in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (2-10%):**

* Deep vein thrombophlebitis
* Wound secretion
* Nausea
* Hematoma
* Anemia
* Residual mass at the injection site


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<2%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Major hemorrhage (including hemophthalmos, intracranial hemorrhage, intraspinal hemorrhage, prosthetic joint hemorrhage, or retroperitoneal hemorrhage)
* Anaphylactoid reaction
* Anaphylaxis
* Cerebrovascular disease
* Decreased hemoglobin
* Dizziness
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Fever
* Hematemesis (vomiting blood)
* Hematuria (blood in urine)
* Fatal hemorrhage
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Hypotension
* Leg pain
* Lower extremity edema
* Thrombosis
* Vomiting
* Impaired wound healing

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, especially bleeding or signs of allergic reaction,  contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Desirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor. Thrombin is a crucial enzyme in the blood clotting process. Desirudin works by binding to and blocking thrombin's activity. This prevents the formation of fibrin (a protein involved in clot formation), inhibits the activation of other clotting factors, and reduces platelet aggregation (clumping).  The overall effect is a reduction in blood clot formation, thus preventing DVT and PE.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Desirudin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to hirudins (a class of anticoagulants) or any component of the formulation and those with active bleeding or irreversible coagulation disorders.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of allergic and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and fatal anaphylactoid reactions, and bleeding.  Desirudin should be used with caution in elderly patients, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and patients being re-exposed to the drug after a previous allergic reaction.

**Boxed Warning (Spinal/Epidural Hematoma):**  The use of neuraxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal anesthesia) or spinal puncture in patients on desirudin increases the risk of spinal or epidural hematoma, which can lead to long-term or permanent paralysis. This risk is further elevated by the use of indwelling spinal catheters, concomitant use of other drugs affecting hemostasis (NSAIDs, platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants), or traumatic spinal punctures. Patients should be closely monitored for neurological symptoms.

**Interactions:** Concomitant use of desirudin with warfarin can lead to greater inhibition of hemostasis.


### FAQs
**Q: How is Desirudin administered?**
A: Desirudin is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  It should be injected deep into the skin folds of the abdomen or thighs, alternating injection sites.

**Q: How long does it take for Desirudin to work?**
A: The onset of action is relatively rapid, but the full effect in preventing blood clot formation takes some time.

**Q: Can I stop taking Desirudin abruptly?**
A: No. Stopping Desirudin abruptly should only be done under the guidance of a physician.

**Q: How should I store Desirudin?**
A: Store Desirudin as directed on the product label. Usually, this involves refrigeration.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Consult your physician or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double the dose.

**Q:  Is Desirudin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**
A:  Desirudin is a Category C drug in pregnancy.  It should only be used if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks to the fetus.  The effect on breastfeeding is unknown; careful consideration is necessary.
