# Darunavir + Ritonavir

**Generic Name:** Darunavir/Ritonavir

**Usage:**

Darunavir/ritonavir is a combination antiviral medication used to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and children (6 months and older, weighing at least 8 kg).  It's typically part of a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen, meaning it's used with other HIV medicines, not on its own.  The specific usage depends on the patient's health status, prior treatment history, and other factors; a doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and combination.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Some common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively frequent and often manageable.
* **Diarrhea:** Can range from mild to severe.
* **Rash:** Can be mild or severe (potentially requiring discontinuation of the drug).
* **Headache:**  Commonly reported.
* **Fatigue:**  A feeling of tiredness or weakness.
* **Increased liver enzymes:** This necessitates monitoring of liver function.
* **Elevated cholesterol and triglycerides:**  Can contribute to cardiovascular risks.
* **Skin discoloration:** Darkening of the skin in some areas.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.
* **Prolonged QT interval:** A potentially serious heart rhythm abnormality.
* **Severe hypersensitivity reactions (rare but serious):** Including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
* **Hepatotoxicity (rare but serious):** Liver damage.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary significantly between individuals.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Darunavir is a protease inhibitor.  Proteases are enzymes HIV needs to replicate. Darunavir blocks the activity of HIV protease, preventing the virus from producing infectious viral particles. Ritonavir is a boosting agent; it inhibits the metabolism of darunavir, allowing higher and more sustained levels of darunavir in the blood, leading to improved effectiveness.  Both drugs work synergistically to suppress HIV replication.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Darunavir/Ritonavir with other medications?**  A:  This is crucial to discuss with your doctor. Many drug interactions are possible.  Some medications may decrease the effectiveness of darunavir/ritonavir, while others may have increased side effects when taken together.  Your doctor will need to assess all your medications and adjust the regimen as needed.

* **Q: How often do I need blood tests?** A: Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor viral load (amount of HIV in the blood), CD4 cell count (a measure of immune system health), and liver and kidney function. The frequency of these tests will be determined by your doctor.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.  Consistent adherence to the prescribed regimen is critical for effectiveness.

* **Q: Can Darunavir/Ritonavir cure HIV?** A: No, Darunavir/Ritonavir does not cure HIV. It suppresses the virus, keeping the viral load undetectable and preventing disease progression, but it does not eradicate the virus from the body.  Lifelong treatment is typically necessary.

* **Q:  Are there any food restrictions?** A:  While no strict dietary restrictions apply, it's best to maintain a healthy diet.  Certain foods or drinks might impact medication absorption or cause gastrointestinal upset.  This should be discussed with your doctor or pharmacist.
