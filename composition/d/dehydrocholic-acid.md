# Dehydrocholic Acid
### Generic Name
Dehydrocholic Acid

### Usage
Dehydrocholic acid is a bile acid derivative primarily used to stimulate bile flow (choleretic effect) and increase the volume of bile produced by the liver (hydrocholeretic effect).  Historically, it was also used as a diuretic and as a diagnostic aid in certain liver function tests. However, its use in over-the-counter medications has been discontinued in some regions, such as Canada.  Currently, its use is limited and often requires a prescription depending on the region and specific application.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider before using dehydrocholic acid for any purpose.

### Dosage
Dosage information for dehydrocholic acid varies considerably depending on the intended use, the specific formulation (tablet, injection etc., if available), and the patient's individual condition.  There is no universally standardized dosage and the information available may be outdated due to the decreased use of the drug. **Any use of dehydrocholic acid should be strictly guided by a physician who can assess the appropriateness of the drug and determine the correct dose.**  Self-medicating with dehydrocholic acid is strongly discouraged.

### Side Effects
Common side effects associated with dehydrocholic acid can include:

*   Diarrhea
*   Abdominal cramps or pain
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting

Less common, but more serious side effects, require immediate medical attention. These may include:

*   Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*   Liver damage
*   Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works
Dehydrocholic acid works by increasing bile flow. Bile is a fluid produced by the liver that aids in the digestion and absorption of fats.  Dehydrocholic acid achieves this by affecting the liver cells (hepatocytes), stimulating them to produce and secrete more bile into the bile ducts. This increased bile production can help in certain conditions involving bile flow dysfunction. The exact mechanisms involved are complex and still under research, but the end result is a significant increase in bile volume and secretion.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Dehydrocholic acid should not be used in patients with known allergies to the drug or bile acids.  Patients with biliary obstruction (blockage of the bile ducts), severe liver disease, or certain gallbladder conditions should avoid this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dehydrocholic acid may interact with other medications.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking before starting dehydrocholic acid.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of dehydrocholic acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established.  Consult your physician before using this medication if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults and Children:**  The use of dehydrocholic acid in older adults and children requires careful consideration due to the potential for increased sensitivity to side effects.  A doctor should carefully assess the risks and benefits before prescribing this medication to these groups.

### FAQs
