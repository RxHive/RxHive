# Dibasic Calcium Phosphate + Magnesium Orotate
### Generic Name
Dibasic Calcium Phosphate + Magnesium Orotate

### Usage

This combination of dibasic calcium phosphate and magnesium orotate is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies or support the intake of calcium and magnesium.  It's not a treatment for a specific disease, but rather a way to increase the levels of these essential minerals in the body.  Calcium is crucial for strong bones and teeth, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. Magnesium plays a vital role in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body, contributing to muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, blood pressure regulation, and protein synthesis.  While often used individually, combining them aims to improve the absorption and synergistic benefits of both minerals.  Some proponents suggest this combination may support bone health, cardiovascular health, and energy levels, but these benefits require further robust clinical research to definitively confirm.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on individual needs, age, health status, and the specific product formulation.  It's crucial to follow the directions on the product label carefully or consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.  There isn't a standardized, universally recommended dosage for this combination.  However, typical dosages for calcium might range from 500mg to 1500mg per day, while magnesium dosages could range from 200mg to 400mg per day.  These dosages should not be exceeded without professional medical advice. The specific ratio of calcium to magnesium in the supplement will also affect the appropriate dosage.  This supplement is usually taken orally, typically with food to improve absorption and minimize potential gastrointestinal upset.  There are no intravenous (IV) formulations of this specific combination readily available.

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort. These are often mild and transient, lessening with continued use or adjusting the dosage.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), hypermagnesemia (high blood magnesium levels). These are rarer, particularly in individuals with healthy kidneys. Symptoms might include muscle weakness, fatigue, confusion, and changes in heart rhythm.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.**
* **Other:**  Individual reactions may vary. Some people might experience allergic reactions, such as rash or itching.

It's important to note that the side effects listed above are potential side effects of both calcium and magnesium supplements when taken individually or in combination.  The incidence and severity of these side effects are influenced by various factors, including the dosage taken and the individual's overall health.

### How it Works

Dibasic calcium phosphate provides calcium in a readily absorbable form.  Magnesium orotate is a form of magnesium believed to be easily absorbed and utilized by the body. Both minerals are essential for various bodily functions.  The combination aims to improve the bioavailability and synergistic effect of both minerals, meaning that the body may absorb and utilize them more effectively together than when taken separately.  The exact mechanism of any synergistic effects requires further research.

### Precautions

* **Kidney Disease:** Individuals with kidney disease should exercise caution and consult their doctor before taking this supplement, as impaired kidney function can affect the body's ability to excrete calcium and magnesium, potentially leading to dangerous levels in the blood.
* **Interactions:** This supplement might interact with certain medications, such as some antibiotics, diuretics, and heart medications. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions if you are currently taking any medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult a healthcare professional before taking this supplement during pregnancy or breastfeeding to ensure it's safe and appropriate for you and your baby.
* **Other Medical Conditions:** Individuals with certain medical conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism, should use caution and consult a physician before supplementing with calcium.  Likewise, people with conditions affecting magnesium metabolism should proceed with caution.
* **Storage:** Store the supplement in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.
