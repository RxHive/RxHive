# Diethylstilbestrol
### Generic Name
Diethylstilbestrol

### Usage
Diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic estrogen with several applications, primarily in the management of specific cancers and certain gynecological conditions.  Its main use is in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer that responds to testosterone suppression.  It works by lowering testosterone levels, thus slowing the growth of the cancer cells.  Diethylstilbestrol is also used as palliative treatment for malignant breast cancer in postmenopausal women, although its use in this indication is less common now due to the availability of other, potentially safer treatment options.  Finally, it can be used to treat menopausal atrophic vaginitis, a condition characterized by vaginal dryness and inflammation.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

* **Advanced Prostate Cancer:**  The oral dosage typically ranges from 1 to 3 mg per day.
* **Menopausal Atrophic Vaginitis:**  This condition is often treated with a vaginal pessary containing 1 mg of diethylstilbestrol daily.
* **Palliative Treatment of Breast Cancer (Postmenopausal Women):** Oral dosages of 10 to 20 mg per day may be prescribed.

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments are not typically made for hepatic or renal impairment. In fact, diethylstilbestrol is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with severe or active liver disease or kidney failure.  Children should never receive this medication.

### Side Effects
Diethylstilbestrol can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially more serious.

**Common Side Effects (1-10% of patients):**

* Lower extremity edema (swelling)
* Abdominal cramps
* Nausea
* Anorexia
* Weight changes (gain or loss)
* Breast enlargement
* Vaginal irritation

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Blood clots (thrombosis) in arteries or veins, including potentially life-threatening events like stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary embolism.
* Gallstones
* Skin rash
* Increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia)
* Gynecomastia (breast development in men)
* Uterine bleeding abnormalities

**Other Reported Side Effects:**  Many other side effects have been reported,  ranging from headaches and mood changes to more serious conditions like various types of cancer.  This is not an exhaustive list.

**If you experience any side effects, especially concerning ones, contact your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works
Diethylstilbestrol is an estrogen agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of the natural hormone estrogen. In men with prostate cancer, this leads to a decrease in testosterone production, which is vital for the growth of many prostate cancer cells.  In women, it addresses the estrogen deficiency contributing to menopausal atrophic vaginitis. While the exact mechanism in breast cancer is more complex, it involves reducing the stimulation of cancer cell growth that may be fueled by estrogen.

### Precautions
Diethylstilbestrol carries significant precautions and contraindications.  It is particularly important to be aware of these before starting treatment:

* **Pregnancy:** Diethylstilbestrol is a Category X drug, meaning it is contraindicated during pregnancy.  It can cause severe birth defects.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Estrogen-Dependent Cancers:** This drug should never be used in individuals with estrogen-dependent cancers (tumors whose growth is fueled by estrogen).
* **Thromboembolic Disorders:**  It is contraindicated in patients with a history of blood clots.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Use is contraindicated in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.
* **Other Medications:** Diethylstilbestrol may interact with other medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time to see effects varies depending on the condition and individual response.  Your doctor will monitor your progress closely.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking diethylstilbestrol without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can sometimes lead to complications.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the medication label. Generally, store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking it?** A:  Alcohol can potentially worsen some side effects.  Consult your doctor regarding alcohol consumption.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one. Contact your doctor for advice.
