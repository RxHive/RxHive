# Duvelisib
### Generic Name
Duvelisib

### Usage
Duvelisib is a medication used to treat certain types of blood cancers that have not responded well to previous treatments.  Specifically, it's approved for adult patients with:

* **Relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL):**  This means the cancer has returned after treatment or hasn't responded to previous therapies.  Duvelisib is used after at least two other treatments have been tried.
* **Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL):** Similar to CLL/SLL, this indicates the cancer has relapsed or is resistant to prior treatments.  Duvelisib is employed after at least two systemic therapies have failed.


### Dosage

The standard adult dosage of Duvelisib is 25 mg twice daily (BID) by mouth.  This is given as oral capsules.  The medication should be swallowed whole; do not crush or open the capsules. It can be taken with or without food.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Duvelisib dosage may need to be adjusted based on individual factors like liver or kidney function, as well as the occurrence of side effects.  Severe side effects often necessitate dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of the medication.  Your healthcare provider will monitor your condition closely and make any necessary adjustments.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  While the manufacturer's label doesn't specify dosage adjustments for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, the impact on Duvelisib exposure is considered clinically insignificant. However, close monitoring of liver function is essential during treatment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for renal impairment, even for creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 23 mL/min. Nevertheless, close monitoring is crucial.
* **Concomitant CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** If taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (like ketoconazole), your doctor will likely reduce your Duvelisib dose to 15 mg BID to avoid adverse drug interactions.
* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Duvelisib in children have not been established.

### Side Effects

Duvelisib, like many cancer medications, can cause several side effects.  These can vary in severity from person to person.  Some common side effects include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Edema (swelling)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Low white blood cell count (neutropenia)
* Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Low phosphate levels (hypophosphatemia)
* Low sodium levels (hyponatremia)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Infections (including serious ones like pneumonia and sepsis)
* Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

Some serious side effects, although less frequent, can be life-threatening. These include severe infections, severe diarrhea/colitis, severe skin reactions, and severe pneumonitis.  Immediately contact your doctor if you experience any concerning symptoms.

### How it Works

Duvelisib is a kinase inhibitor that works by blocking the activity of two specific enzymes called PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma.  These enzymes play a vital role in the growth and survival of certain cancer cells. By inhibiting their function, Duvelisib helps slow or stop the growth of cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells.

### Precautions

* **Infections:** Duvelisib can increase the risk of infections.  Prophylactic measures (like PCP and antiviral prophylaxis) may be necessary.  Report any signs of infection immediately.
* **Diarrhea and Colitis:**  Duvelisib can cause diarrhea and colitis (inflammation of the colon).  Severe cases may require hospitalization.  Report any significant changes in bowel habits.
* **Skin Reactions:** Severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience a severe skin reaction.
* **Pneumonitis:**  Lung inflammation (pneumonitis) is another potential side effect.  Report any shortness of breath or chest pain.
* **Hepatotoxicity:**  Liver damage can occur. Regular monitoring of liver function is crucial.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Duvelisib interacts with certain other medications, especially those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Duvelisib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Duvelisib.
