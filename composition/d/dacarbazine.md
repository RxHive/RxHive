# Dacarbazine
### Generic Name
Dacarbazine

### Usage

Dacarbazine is a chemotherapy drug primarily used in the treatment of two types of cancer:

*   **Hodgkin lymphoma:**  It's not used alone but as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen, most often alongside other drugs like doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (the ABVD regimen).  It's also sometimes included in regimens with brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, and vinblastine (A-AVD).  These combinations are crucial for effectively targeting Hodgkin lymphoma cells.

*   **Metastatic malignant melanoma:** Dacarbazine can be used to treat melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body.  While it may offer some benefit, it's important to note that melanoma is often treated with more targeted therapies when possible, and dacarbazine might be used when other options aren't suitable.

It's crucial to understand that dacarbazine is almost always part of a multi-drug approach, not a standalone treatment.  Its use in other cancers is considered "off-label," meaning it's not officially approved for those conditions but may be used under specific circumstances by a physician.  Examples include soft tissue sarcoma, medullary thyroid cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and malignant pheochromocytoma.  The dosage and regimen vary greatly depending on the specific cancer and other medications used in combination.


### Dosage

Dacarbazine dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the type of cancer being treated, the patient's body surface area (BSA) or weight, and the specific chemotherapy regimen employed.  Dosage is usually calculated in mg/m² (milligrams per square meter of body surface area).  It's administered intravenously (IV).  There is no standard pediatric dosage, as the regimen is adapted based on the child's age, weight, and specific cancer characteristics.  

**Adult Dosage Examples (Illustrative, Not Exhaustive):**

*   **Hodgkin Lymphoma (ABVD regimen):** 375 mg/m² on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, repeated for several cycles.
*   **Metastatic Malignant Melanoma:**  Dosages vary, from 250 mg/m²/day for five consecutive days every three weeks to 2-4.5 mg/kg/day for ten days every four weeks.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Pediatric dosages are determined by a physician and are significantly different from adult dosages, typically adjusted by body surface area or weight and the specific regimen used.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on factors like kidney or liver function.  There are no official dosage adjustments for obesity from the manufacturer, but clinical guidelines advise using the patient's actual weight for dosage calculations, especially for curative intent.  Always consult a medical professional for proper dosage.


### Side Effects

Dacarbazine can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
*   Alopecia (hair loss)
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite)
*   Flu-like symptoms
*   Metallic taste
*   Rash
*   Injection site pain


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Myelosuppression (severe suppression of bone marrow function)
*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Hepatic necrosis (liver cell death)
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Seizures
*   Cerebral hemorrhage


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Dacarbazine is an alkylating agent, a type of chemotherapy drug that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells.  It's converted in the body into an active metabolite (MTIC) which binds to DNA, causing double-strand breaks and ultimately leading to the death of cancer cells through a process called apoptosis (programmed cell death).  It's considered a non-cell-cycle-specific drug, meaning it can affect cancer cells regardless of their stage in the cell cycle.


### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Dacarbazine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
*   **Myelosuppression:** Dacarbazine can severely suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts. This is a significant risk and requires close monitoring of blood counts.
*   **Hepatotoxicity:**  Liver damage, including potentially fatal hepatic necrosis, is a potential side effect. Liver function tests are crucial for monitoring.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Dacarbazine is classified as a Category C drug during pregnancy, indicating potential risk to the fetus.  Breastfeeding should be avoided while receiving this medication.
*   **Live Vaccines:**  Avoid live vaccines during and for a period after dacarbazine treatment due to the risk of infection.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Dacarbazine can interact with other medications, including some vaccines. Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Dacarbazine administered?**  A: It's administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.

*   **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the type of cancer, the specific regimen used, and the patient's response to treatment. It can range from several cycles to many months.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Never adjust your dosage or treatment schedule without consulting your oncologist.

*   **Q: How should I store Dacarbazine?** A: This medication is handled and stored by medical professionals.  Do not attempt to store it at home.

*   **Q: Is Dacarbazine safe?** A:  Like all chemotherapy drugs, dacarbazine carries risks.  The benefits of treatment must be carefully weighed against the potential side effects by a medical professional.  Close monitoring and prompt management of side effects are crucial.
