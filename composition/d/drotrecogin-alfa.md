# Drotrecogin Alfa
### Generic Name
Drotrecogin alfa

### Usage

Drotrecogin alfa was a medication used to reduce mortality in adults with severe sepsis accompanied by acute organ dysfunction and a high risk of death.  The assessment of high risk was typically based on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, with a threshold of 25 or higher.  It's crucial to note that this drug is **no longer available on the market** due to a lack of demonstrated efficacy in later studies.  Therefore, while the information below describes its past use, it is not currently used to treat sepsis or any other condition.

### Dosage

As drotrecogin alfa is no longer available, specific dosage information is provided for historical context only and should not be used for treatment. The recommended dosage involved intravenous administration, with the specific regimen varying based on the patient's weight and clinical condition.  Detailed dosage instructions were available in the original prescribing information, but are now obsolete.

### Side Effects

Since drotrecogin alfa is no longer marketed, the following list of side effects is provided for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a current risk profile.  Past reported side effects included:

* Bleeding (ranging from minor to severe)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Liver enzyme abnormalities
* Kidney problems

It is important to note that this list is not exhaustive.  Serious, though less common, side effects were also possible.

### How it Works

Drotrecogin alfa is a recombinant form of human activated protein C.  It works by modulating the body's inflammatory and coagulation systems.  Specifically, it inhibits the coagulation cascade (the process that leads to blood clot formation) by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa. This action helped reduce the formation of potentially harmful blood clots often associated with severe sepsis.  It also possessed anti-inflammatory effects.  However,  subsequent research did not confirm a significant benefit from these mechanisms outweighing the risks.


### Precautions

Given that drotrecogin alfa is no longer available, these precautions are for historical reference only and should not be considered current medical guidance.  Past precautions included:

* **Contraindications:**  The drug was contraindicated in patients with a history of uncontrolled bleeding, significant risk of bleeding (such as recent major surgery), or active internal bleeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications, particularly anticoagulants or drugs affecting blood clotting, needed to be carefully considered.
* **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, and patients with liver or kidney impairment, required careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.


### FAQs

**Q: Why is drotrecogin alfa no longer available?**

A:  The manufacturer voluntarily withdrew drotrecogin alfa from the market after a major clinical trial failed to show a significant benefit in reducing mortality in patients with severe sepsis.

**Q:  Are there alternative treatments for severe sepsis?**

A: Yes, the management of severe sepsis involves a multifaceted approach that includes supportive care (fluid resuscitation, oxygen therapy, and blood pressure support), antibiotics (for bacterial infections), and other medications targeted at addressing the specific complications of sepsis.  It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider for the most appropriate and current treatment options.

**Q: What should I do if I have any questions about my past treatment with drotrecogin alfa?**

A: Consult with your doctor or pharmacist.  They can provide personalized advice based on your medical history.  This information should not replace medical consultation.
