# Dexlansoprazole

**Generic Name:** Dexlansoprazole

**Usage:** Dexlansoprazole is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including erosive esophagitis (damage to the esophagus from stomach acid), and healing duodenal ulcers.  It's also used for long-term maintenance of healed erosive esophagitis to prevent it from returning. It reduces stomach acid production.  It is available as a delayed-release capsule, meaning it releases the medication in the small intestine rather than the stomach. This helps minimize stomach irritation.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, dexlansoprazole can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A fairly common side effect.
* **Diarrhea:** Can range from mild to moderate.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stool.
* **Abdominal pain:** Pain in the stomach area.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Flatulence:** Excessive gas.
* **Dry mouth:** Reduced saliva production.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired.


Less common, but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, include:

* **Signs of allergic reaction:** Hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing.
* **Severe stomach pain:**  This could indicate a serious complication.
* **Muscle weakness:**  Could be a sign of a more serious condition.
* **Bone fractures:** Long-term use has been associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, particularly in elderly patients.
* **Vitamin B12 deficiency:** Prolonged use can interfere with B12 absorption.
* **C. difficile-associated diarrhea:**  A serious bacterial infection of the intestines.


**How it Works:** Dexlansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).  PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced by the stomach's parietal cells.  These cells are responsible for producing stomach acid.  Dexlansoprazole is a specific isomer (dextrorotatory form) of lansoprazole, and it's believed to be more potent and have a longer duration of action than the racemic mixture (lansoprazole).  It's absorbed in the intestine and reaches the parietal cells, where it inhibits the enzyme that produces stomach acid.


**FAQs:**

* **Is dexlansoprazole better than other PPIs?**  Dexlansoprazole is considered a similar medication to other PPIs like lansoprazole, omeprazole, and pantoprazole.  Studies have shown differences in efficacy and side effect profiles among these medications, but the best choice will depend on individual factors and should be determined by a doctor.

* **How long does it take to work?**  It usually takes a few days for dexlansoprazole to significantly reduce stomach acid production, but symptom relief may be noticed sooner.

* **Can I take dexlansoprazole with other medications?**  Some medications can interact with dexlansoprazole.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting dexlansoprazole.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking dexlansoprazole?**  While dexlansoprazole doesn't directly interact with alcohol, alcohol can worsen GERD symptoms and it's advisable to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Can I stop taking dexlansoprazole suddenly?**  It's generally recommended to not stop taking dexlansoprazole suddenly, especially if you have been on it for a prolonged period.  Talk to your doctor before discontinuing this medication.
