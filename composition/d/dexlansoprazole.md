# Dexlansoprazole
### Generic Name
Dexlansoprazole

### Usage
Dexlansoprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) primarily used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Its main application is in healing and maintaining the healing of erosive esophagitis (EE), a condition where the esophagus becomes inflamed and damaged due to stomach acid reflux.  Dexlansoprazole is also effective in managing the symptoms of non-erosive GERD, where heartburn and acid reflux occur without visible esophageal damage.  The medication works by reducing the amount of acid produced in the stomach.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Erosive Esophagitis (Healing):** The typical starting dose is 60 mg once daily for up to eight weeks.
* **Erosive Esophagitis (Maintenance):** After the initial healing period, the dose may be reduced to 30 mg once daily for up to six months to prevent recurrence.
* **Symptomatic Non-Erosive GERD:** The usual dose is 30 mg once daily for four weeks.


**Children (Aged 12 and Older):**

The dosage for children 12 years and older is the same as for adults for both erosive esophagitis (healing and maintenance) and symptomatic non-erosive GERD.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild impairment, no dosage adjustment is usually necessary.  For moderate impairment, the dose may need to be reduced; consult a healthcare professional. Severe hepatic impairment contraindicates the use of dexlansoprazole.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Generally, no dosage adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment. However, it's advisable to consult a doctor for personalized advice.


**Administration:** Dexlansoprazole is administered orally and can be taken with or without food.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Flatulence
* Constipation
* Skin rash


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* *Clostridium difficile* infection (leading to severe diarrhea)
*  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*  Pancreatitis
*  Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*  Bone fractures (with long-term use)
*  Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels)

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dexlansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by specifically targeting and blocking the proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase) located in the cells lining the stomach. This proton pump is responsible for the final step in acid production.  By inhibiting this pump, dexlansoprazole significantly reduces the amount of stomach acid secreted, thus relieving the symptoms of GERD and promoting healing of erosive esophagitis.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dexlansoprazole is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and with concomitant use of rilpivirine-containing products.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Dexlansoprazole can interact with several medications, including atazanavir (reducing its effectiveness) and drugs with pH-dependent absorption.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.  Warfarin monitoring is recommended when dexlansoprazole is used concurrently.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Dexlansoprazole is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  The decision to use it during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits against potential risks to the mother and child.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Long-Term Use:** Long-term use of PPIs like dexlansoprazole can increase the risk of bone fractures, hypomagnesemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency.  Regular monitoring might be necessary.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with hepatic impairment should use caution and may require dosage adjustments.  Dexlansoprazole should be used cautiously in patients with a history of *Clostridium difficile* infection, lupus, or osteoporosis.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dexlansoprazole with food?** A: Yes, dexlansoprazole can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of symptom relief can vary, but many individuals see improvement within a few days.  Complete healing of erosive esophagitis usually takes several weeks.
* **Q: Can I stop taking dexlansoprazole abruptly?** A: No, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions regarding discontinuation. Stopping abruptly could lead to a relapse of symptoms.
* **Q: How should I store dexlansoprazole?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with dexlansoprazole?** A:  Long-term use can increase the risk of certain conditions like bone fractures, *Clostridium difficile* infection, and vitamin B12 deficiency. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is advisable.
