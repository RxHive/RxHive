# Divalproex sodium
### Generic Name
Divalproex Sodium

### Usage

Divalproex sodium is primarily used to treat certain types of seizures.  It's effective for complex partial seizures, simple and complex absence seizures, and as an add-on therapy for patients experiencing multiple seizure types that include absence seizures.  Beyond epilepsy, it also plays a significant role in managing manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features.  It can be used as both monotherapy (the sole medication) and as adjunctive therapy (alongside other medications).  Finally, divalproex sodium is also sometimes used to prevent migraine headaches.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.  Generally:

* **Mania:**  Oral administration, starting at 750 mg/day in divided doses (delayed-release tablets) or 25 mg/kg/day (extended-release tablets).  The dose is carefully increased to find the lowest effective dose, with a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day.

* **Epilepsy:** Oral administration, starting at 10-15 mg/kg/day. The dose can be increased gradually (5-10 mg/kg/week) until seizures are controlled, up to a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day.

* **Migraine prophylaxis:** Oral administration, beginning at 250 mg twice daily (delayed-release tablets) or 500 mg once daily (extended-release tablets).  Higher doses (up to 1000 mg/day) may be used if needed.


**Pediatric Dosage:** For epilepsy in children aged 10 and older, the dosage is generally the same as for adults, always under the strict guidance of a physician.  Children under 10 require careful dosage adjustment based on weight and the specific condition, and using only the appropriate formulation for this age group.  Children under the age of two are at a significantly increased risk of serious liver damage and should only take this medication under extremely cautious supervision by a medical professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal impairment generally doesn't require dosage changes; however, patients with hepatic (liver) impairment need lower doses.  In severe liver impairment, it is contraindicated.

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above as serious side effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Divalproex sodium works by increasing levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.  GABA helps calm nerve activity, which is beneficial in controlling seizures and stabilizing mood. Divalproex sodium also appears to affect other neurotransmitters and cellular pathways.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Divalproex sodium is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components, severe liver disease, urea cycle disorders, certain mitochondrial disorders (particularly those related to POLG mutations), and for migraine prevention in pregnant or potentially pregnant women.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Divalproex sodium can interact with numerous other medications, including other anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, aspirin, and anticoagulants.  This can alter drug levels and effectiveness.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Divalproex sodium is a Category D drug for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and Category X for migraine prevention during pregnancy (meaning the risk to the fetus outweighs the benefit).  It's crucial to discuss risks with your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.  It's excreted in breast milk, posing a risk to the infant.
* **Children:** Exercise extreme caution when using in children under two years old, due to the risk of potentially fatal liver damage.
* **Liver Function Monitoring:** Regular blood tests to monitor liver function are vital, especially during the first six months of treatment.
* **Suicidal Thoughts:**  Report any suicidal thoughts or behavioral changes immediately to your healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking divalproex sodium suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking divalproex sodium suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to serious consequences, such as increased seizures or worsening of bipolar symptoms.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce your dose to minimize withdrawal effects.

* **Q: How should I store divalproex sodium?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Are there other medicines I shouldn't take with divalproex sodium?** A:  Yes, there are many potential drug interactions.  It's essential to discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor to avoid harmful interactions.  This includes over-the-counter medications as well as herbal supplements.
