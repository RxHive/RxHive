# Docaravimab + Miromavimab
### Generic Name
Docaravimab + Mirolavimab (Combination Therapy)

### Usage
Docaravimab and Mirolavimab are monoclonal antibodies administered together. This combination therapy is specifically indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization.  The primary use is to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death due to COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  It's crucial to understand that this treatment is *not* a substitute for vaccination and is used in specific circumstances under a physician's guidance.  This treatment targets specific viral proteins and aims to neutralize the virus before it can cause significant damage.  It's important to note that this combination is used for a specific subset of patients and is not a broad-spectrum COVID-19 treatment.

### Dosage
Docaravimab and Mirolavimab are administered intravenously (IV) as a single dose.  The exact dosage will be determined by a physician based on the patient's weight and clinical condition.  The dosage is typically a fixed combination, and the solution is prepared and administered by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting. There is no oral formulation available. Dosage adjustments for age, weight, or severity of the condition are not explicitly detailed in product information, as the treatment is targeted at a defined group, and dosage decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by clinicians.  This medication is not approved for use in children under 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Infusion-related reactions (e.g., rash, itching, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, hypotension)
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Muscle pain
* Nausea


Less common, but potentially serious side effects require immediate medical attention and should be reported to your doctor:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Serious infusion reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of treatment.

It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider about any side effects experienced, even if they seem minor.

### How it Works
Docaravimab and Mirolavimab are monoclonal antibodies designed to target specific parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Docaravimab binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, while Mirolavimab targets a different epitope on the RBD. By binding to these regions, the antibodies prevent the virus from attaching to and entering human cells, thereby neutralizing the virus and limiting its ability to replicate and cause disease. The combined action of these two antibodies enhances their efficacy compared to using either antibody alone, particularly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:**  Individuals with known hypersensitivity to Docaravimab, Mirolavimab, or any components of the formulation should not receive this treatment.

* **Older Adults:** While not specifically excluded, older adults might be at increased risk for certain side effects. Close monitoring is advised.
