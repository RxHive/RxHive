# Dexketoprofen + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Dexketoprofen + Paracetamol (also known as Dexketoprofen Trometamol + Paracetamol)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and reduce fever. It's often prescribed for moderate to severe pain associated with conditions such as:

* Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., back pain, arthritis, muscle strains)
* Dental pain
* Post-surgical pain
* Menstrual cramps
* Headache (when severe enough to warrant this combination)


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Dexketoprofen + Paracetamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea.  More serious gastrointestinal issues like ulcers and bleeding are possible, though less common.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased blood pressure (though less frequent with paracetamol).
* **Skin:** Rash, itching.
* **Other:** Swelling, fluid retention.


**Rare but serious side effects require immediate medical attention:** These include allergic reactions (such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe stomach pain, black or bloody stools, persistent vomiting, and signs of liver damage (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools).

The frequency and severity of side effects vary depending on the dosage, individual sensitivity, and duration of use.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works by combining the actions of two different pain relievers:

* **Dexketoprofen:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing inflammation and inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer. Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, reducing pain and fever signals.

The combination provides broader pain relief and covers a wider spectrum of pain pathways than either drug alone.
