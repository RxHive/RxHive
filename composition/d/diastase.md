# Diastase
### Generic Name
Diastase

### Usage

Diastase, often used in combination with pepsin, is primarily a digestive aid.  Its main purpose is to alleviate symptoms associated with indigestion, such as acid indigestion, stomach upset, flatulence (gas), epigastric distress (upper abdominal discomfort), dyspepsia (indigestion), and eructation (belching). It may also be used to stimulate appetite.  It's important to note that diastase doesn't treat the underlying cause of these digestive issues but rather helps manage the symptoms.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the formulation.

* **Capsule:** Typically, one capsule is taken after meals, twice or three times daily (BID or TID).
* **Syrup:**  The usual dose is 5 milliliters (mL) taken immediately after meals.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For children, the recommended dose is generally half the adult dose.  However, it's crucial to consult a pediatrician before giving diastase to children to determine the appropriate dosage based on the child's age and weight.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent.  However, some individuals may experience:

* Nausea
* Mild stomach upset

Serious side effects are rare.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after taking diastase, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Diastase is an enzyme that aids in the digestion of carbohydrates. Specifically, it breaks down complex carbohydrates (starches) into simpler sugars like maltose, which is further broken down into glucose. This process facilitates the absorption of carbohydrates, easing the burden on the digestive system and reducing symptoms of indigestion.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Diastase should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the medication or those suffering from acute or chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
* **Drug Interactions:** Diastase may interact with metronidazole and other drugs belonging to the same class.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting diastase.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of diastase during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  It's generally not recommended for use during these periods unless specifically prescribed by a healthcare professional.
* **General Considerations:** Diastase is typically taken after meals to maximize its effectiveness in aiding digestion.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for diastase to work?**  A: The effects of diastase are usually felt relatively quickly, often within a short time after taking it with a meal.
* **Q: Can I take diastase every day?** A:  While diastase is generally considered safe for short-term use, it's best to use it only as needed to manage digestive symptoms.  Long-term use should be discussed with a doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Simply take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store diastase?** A: Store diastase according to the instructions on the product label.  Generally, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q:  Is diastase suitable for everyone?** A: No.  Diastase is not suitable for people with certain medical conditions, allergies or who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  Always consult your physician before taking any medication.
