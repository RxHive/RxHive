# Decitabine
### Generic Name
Decitabine

### Usage

Decitabine is primarily used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).  MDS is a group of cancers affecting blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.  It leads to insufficient production of healthy blood cells. Decitabine is effective against various MDS subtypes, including refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Its effectiveness spans across different risk groups as categorized by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), encompassing intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk groups.  Decitabine can be used in both previously treated and untreated cases.

While its primary use is in MDS, Decitabine also sees off-label use in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in older adults (≥60 years) and those with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics or TP53 mutations.  The off-label use often involves combination therapy with other medications.

### Dosage

Decitabine dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the specific treatment regimen. It's crucial to follow the physician's instructions precisely.

**Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):**

* **3-day regimen:** 15 mg/m² intravenously (IV) over 3 hours every 8 hours for 3 days (total daily dose 45 mg/m²), repeated every 6 weeks after hematologic recovery (ANC ≥1000/mm³ and platelet count ≥50,000/mm³).  A minimum of 4 cycles is recommended.
* **5-day regimen:** 20 mg/m² IV over 1 hour daily for 5 days, repeated every 4 weeks after hematologic recovery. A minimum of 4 cycles is recommended.


**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) (off-label use):** Dosage varies greatly based on age, genetic factors, and potential combination therapies.  Generally, doses range from 20 mg/m² IV over 1 hour daily for 5-10 days, repeated every 28 days until disease progression, relapse or unacceptable toxicity.  Consult a healthcare professional for specific dosage guidance in AML.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are typically made based on the patient's response to treatment and the occurrence of side effects, primarily hematologic toxicity (low blood cell counts).  Renal or hepatic impairment might also necessitate modifications, though specific guidelines aren't universally standardized in the prescribing information.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage adjustments.


### Side Effects

Decitabine, like many cancer treatments, can cause side effects.  The severity and frequency vary among individuals.

**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Decreased appetite
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Anemia
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe infections due to neutropenia
* Serious bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Severe liver damage
* Kidney problems
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Pulmonary complications


If any side effects occur, especially severe or persistent ones, consult a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, meaning it works by altering DNA methylation.  DNA methylation is a process where methyl groups attach to DNA, influencing gene expression.  Cancer cells often have abnormal DNA methylation patterns. Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA, inhibiting DNA methyltransferases—enzymes responsible for methylation. This disruption leads to changes in gene expression, ultimately causing cancer cell death, primarily during the S phase of the cell cycle (when DNA replicates).


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Decitabine is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for a period after treatment completion (typically 6 months).
* **Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is not recommended during Decitabine treatment and for at least two weeks after the last dose due to the unknown potential for excretion in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** Decitabine can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Patients with pre-existing liver or kidney problems should be carefully monitored during Decitabine treatment as it can exacerbate these conditions.
* **Myelosuppression:** Decitabine can significantly suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia).  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor this.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Decitabine?**  A: The time to see a response varies significantly between patients.  Some may see improvements within a few cycles, while others might require more time.  Consistent monitoring and close follow-up with your doctor are crucial.

* **Q: How is Decitabine administered?** A: Decitabine is administered intravenously (IV).  The infusion rate and duration depend on the prescribed regimen.

* **Q: How should I store Decitabine?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not attempt to adjust the dosage yourself.  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately to discuss the missed dose and the next steps.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Decitabine?** A: Like other cancer therapies, Decitabine can have long-term effects.  Regular check-ups with your doctor are necessary to monitor for any potential long-term complications.  Discuss any concerns about long-term side effects with your healthcare team.
