# Dalfampridine

**Generic Name:** Dalfampridine

**Usage:**  Dalfampridine is used to improve walking in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have difficulty with walking due to MS.  It's specifically indicated for adults with MS who experience moderate to severe walking disability.  It is *not* a cure for MS and does not treat other symptoms of the disease.


**Side Effects:** Dalfampridine can cause several side effects, some common and some serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Seizures:** This is a serious side effect and a reason for careful monitoring.  Patients with a history of seizures should generally not take this drug.
* **Dizziness:** This can lead to falls, so caution is advised, especially when starting the medication.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:**  May occur in some patients.
* **Vomiting:**  May occur in some patients.
* **Drowsiness:**  Can impair cognitive function and reaction times.
* **Tremor:**  Shaking or trembling.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Blurred vision:**  Impaired visual acuity.
* **Fast heartbeat (tachycardia):** Increased heart rate.

Serious side effects, although less common, can include:

* **Allergic reactions:** Including rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema).  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Cardiovascular events:**  Though rare, changes in heart rhythm and blood pressure have been reported.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:**  Dalfampridine is thought to work by blocking potassium channels in the nerves.  In MS patients, damage to the myelin sheath (the protective covering of nerves) slows down nerve impulse transmission.  By blocking these potassium channels, dalfampridine may help improve the speed of nerve impulses, thereby improving walking ability.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Dalfampridine right for me?** Only a doctor can determine if dalfampridine is appropriate for your individual circumstances.  It's crucial to discuss your medical history, including any pre-existing conditions, medications you're currently taking, and potential drug interactions.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Follow your doctor's instructions. Generally, it's advisable not to take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Dalfampridine?**  It's generally recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking dalfampridine, as alcohol can exacerbate side effects like dizziness and drowsiness.
* **How long will it take to see results?**  The effects of dalfampridine may not be immediately noticeable.  It may take several weeks or longer to observe any improvements in walking ability.
* **What are the potential drug interactions?** Dalfampridine can interact with other medications, so it's important to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  This is crucial to avoid potential adverse effects.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.
