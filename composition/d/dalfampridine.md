# Dalfampridine
### Generic Name
Dalfampridine

### Usage
Dalfampridine is primarily used to improve walking ability in adults diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).  It's specifically indicated for those experiencing MS-related gait difficulties.  Currently, there are no approved uses in children or for other conditions.

### Dosage
**Adults (Multiple Sclerosis):** The typical adult dosage is 10 mg twice daily (BID), approximately 12 hours apart.  The maximum daily dose is 20 mg.  It's crucial to understand that exceeding this dose does not provide additional benefits and may increase the risk of side effects.  Missed doses should not be doubled; simply take the next dose as scheduled.  Dalfampridine is available in tablet form and should be swallowed whole; do not crush, chew, or break the tablets.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of dalfampridine have not been established in children under 18 years of age.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance, CrCl, of 51-80 mL/min) may require cautious use, as the risk of seizures can be elevated due to decreased drug clearance.  Dalfampridine is contraindicated in individuals with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCl â‰¤ 50 mL/min).


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Urinary tract infection


**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Insomnia, dizziness, headache, balance problems (equilibrium disturbance), and tingling sensations (paresthesia)
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, constipation, and indigestion (dyspepsia)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Weakness, back pain, and acute worsening of multiple sclerosis symptoms
* Respiratory: Runny or stuffy nose (nasopharyngitis), and throat pain (pharyngolaryngeal pain)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Severe allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)
* Seizures
* Vomiting

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker. In individuals with MS, the myelin sheath (protective covering) around nerve fibers is damaged, impairing nerve signal transmission.  Dalfampridine works by blocking potassium channels, which helps to prolong the nerve signals, improving conduction along demyelinated nerve fibers. This enhanced nerve conduction improves muscle fiber activity, ultimately leading to improved walking ability.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Dalfampridine is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures, hypersensitivity to dalfampridine or 4-aminopyridine (a related drug), or moderate to severe renal impairment.

**Drug Interactions:** Avoid concomitant use with dolutegravir.  Dalfampridine may increase the levels or effects of metformin. The levels or effects of dalfampridine itself can be increased by cimetidine, dolutegravir, metformin, and quinidine.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting dalfampridine.

**Warnings:**  Dalfampridine increases the risk of seizures, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions that lower the seizure threshold. The risk of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and urinary tract infections is also increased.  Use with caution in individuals with a history of these conditions.  It should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare providers before using this medication.


### FAQs
