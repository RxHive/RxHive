# Dextroamphetamine
### Generic Name
Dextroamphetamine

### Usage
Dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used to treat two distinct conditions:

* **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):**  It helps manage the symptoms of ADHD, such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, in children aged 3-16 years (immediate-release forms) and 6-16 years (extended-release forms).  It's crucial to understand that dextroamphetamine is part of a comprehensive treatment plan, usually including therapy, educational support, and social interventions.

* **Narcolepsy:** This medication is also effective in treating narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the individual's age, weight, condition being treated, and response to the medication.  It's absolutely vital to follow a doctor's prescribed dosage and not adjust it without consulting them.  The following information is for general understanding and does not replace a healthcare professional's guidance.

**Adults:**

* **Narcolepsy:**  Dosage typically starts low (e.g., 10 mg once daily) and may be gradually increased (in 10 mg increments at intervals of at least one week) based on individual response and tolerance, up to a maximum of 60 mg/day.  Immediate-release forms might be divided into two or three doses throughout the day. Extended-release forms are usually taken once daily.

* **ADHD:** The starting dose is usually lower and involves a titration process (gradual increase) to find the optimal effective dose. Typical doses range from 5 mg to 40 mg per day, adjusted as needed.  The medication may be divided into two doses a day.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is much lower and always carefully adjusted based on age and weight. It starts with a very low dose (as low as 2.5 mg daily for younger children) and is gradually increased under strict medical supervision.  The maximum daily dose is generally 40 mg, but this is rarely needed and always determined by the physician.  Different formulations (immediate-release, extended-release) have different dosing schedules.


**Administration:** Immediate-release formulations are usually taken multiple times a day, while extended-release forms are typically administered once daily.  Specific instructions should always be obtained from the prescribing doctor or pharmacist. Never crush extended-release capsules.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Loss of appetite
* Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
* Dry mouth
* Stomach upset (nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea)
* Headaches
* Dizziness
* Irritability
* Nervousness
* Increased heart rate
* Increased blood pressure

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

*  Severe allergic reactions (such as angioedema and anaphylaxis)
*  Hallucinations
*  Psychosis
*  Severe changes in mood or behavior
*  Heart problems (including irregular heartbeat and chest pain)
*  Seizures

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant that affects the brain by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that play key roles in attention, focus, and energy levels. By enhancing these neurotransmitters, dextroamphetamine helps improve concentration and reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity in ADHD, and combats excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dextroamphetamine should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to amphetamines, severe cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or those currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Dextroamphetamine can interact with many other medications, including some antidepressants, antihypertensives, and MAOIs. Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Use in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and older adults requires careful consideration and close monitoring due to increased risks of certain side effects.

* **Abuse Potential:** Dextroamphetamine has a high potential for abuse and dependence. It should only be used as prescribed by a doctor and not shared with others.

* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and weight (especially in children) is often necessary during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking dextroamphetamine suddenly?** A: No, abrupt discontinuation, especially after long-term use, can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or altering your medication dosage.

* **Q: Can I take dextroamphetamine with alcohol?** A: It's generally not recommended to combine dextroamphetamine with alcohol, as it can increase the risk of side effects and interactions.

* **Q: How should I store dextroamphetamine?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture, and out of the reach of children.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
