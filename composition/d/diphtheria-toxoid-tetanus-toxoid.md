# Diphtheria Toxoid + Tetanus Toxoid
### Generic Name
Diphtheria Toxoid + Tetanus Toxoid (Td)

### Usage

Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids adsorbed vaccine is used to actively immunize against diphtheria and tetanus.  Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection that can affect the nose, throat, and airways, causing breathing difficulties and potentially death. Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a severe bacterial infection affecting the nervous system, leading to muscle spasms and potentially fatal complications. This vaccine is crucial for preventing these life-threatening illnesses.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Td):**

* **Primary Immunization:** Two 0.5 mL doses given intramuscularly (IM) at least 4 weeks apart. A third reinforcing dose of 0.5 mL is given 6 to 12 months later.  Individuals with incomplete primary immunization (<3 doses) should receive the remaining doses. At least one dose of Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) should be included in the primary series if the individual has not previously received it, ideally as the first dose.
* **Booster Immunization:** For individuals who completed the primary series, a 0.5 mL booster dose is recommended every 10 years, administered IM.

**Pediatric Dosage (DT or Tdap):**

Dosage varies depending on age and previous vaccination status.  Always follow the recommendations provided by the CDC and healthcare professional.  Generally:

* **Primary Immunization (DT for those contraindicated for pertussis vaccines):**  Five 0.5 mL doses are given IM. The first three doses are typically given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (can begin as early as 6 weeks, with 4-8 week intervals between doses). The fourth dose (first booster) is administered around 15-18 months, and the fifth dose (second booster) at 4-6 years (may be omitted if the fourth dose is given at or after 4 years of age).
* **Catch-up Immunization:**  The schedule varies based on the age and doses already received. A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate catch-up schedule.  A pediatric formulation (DT) is used for children with contraindications to pertussis-containing vaccines.
* **Booster Immunization (for children ≥11 years and adolescents ≤18 years):** A single 0.5 mL dose is administered IM.  Tdap is preferred at this age if not contraindicated.  Booster doses (Td or Tdap) are recommended every 10 years thereafter.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified by the manufacturer for hepatic or renal impairment.

**Administration:**  The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults, the deltoid muscle is the preferred site. For children, either the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle can be used.  Avoid injecting into the gluteal muscle.

### How it Works

The diphtheria and tetanus toxoids in the vaccine are inactive forms of the toxins produced by the bacteria. They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that provide protection against diphtheria and tetanus.  These antibodies neutralize the toxins produced by the bacteria, preventing the development of the diseases.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids.
* **Increased Risk:** Individuals may have an increased risk of anaphylactoid reaction/hypersensitivity, Arthus reaction, syncope, weakness, visual disturbances, and tonic-clonic seizures.
* **Use with Caution:**  Use cautiously in children with acute illness, bleeding disorders, or a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome or brachial neuritis.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare provider.  This is categorized as Pregnancy Category C by the FDA, meaning that the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in some pregnant women but risks are unknown.
* **General Considerations:** This vaccine is for intramuscular injection only.  Shake well before use. Do not mix with other vaccines. Separate needles and syringes must be used for each injection.  Patients should be seated or lying down during vaccination to help prevent fainting.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection from this vaccine last?** A: Protection typically lasts for about 10 years, requiring booster shots every 10 years.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe reaction after the shot?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or a severe allergic reaction.
