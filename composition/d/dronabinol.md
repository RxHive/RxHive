# Dronabinol
### Generic Name
Dronabinol

### Usage

Dronabinol is a prescription medication primarily used to treat two distinct conditions:

1. **Anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS:**  Dronabinol stimulates appetite, helping patients with AIDS regain weight lost due to the disease.  This is a crucial aspect of managing the overall health and well-being of these individuals.

2. **Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy:**  For patients who haven't responded adequately to standard anti-nausea medications, dronabinol can help manage the severe nausea and vomiting that often accompany chemotherapy treatments.  This allows patients to better tolerate their cancer treatment and improves their quality of life.

While less common, dronabinol is sometimes used off-label to treat moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.  However, this use is not supported by the same level of clinical evidence as the primary uses mentioned above.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight (especially for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting), and the specific formulation (capsules or oral solution).  Precise dosing should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  The following information is for general understanding only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Anorexia in AIDS patients:**  Treatment begins with a low dose, typically 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) for capsules, or 2.1 mg BID for the oral solution, taken one hour before meals.  The dose can be gradually increased, but should not exceed 20 mg/day (capsules) or 16.8 mg/day (oral solution). Elderly patients or those who experience side effects may start on a lower dose.

* **Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:** Dosing is usually calculated based on body surface area (m²). A typical starting dose might be 5 mg/m² one to three hours before chemotherapy, followed by additional doses every two to four hours as needed (up to four to six doses per day). The maximum dose is generally 15 mg/m² per dose for capsules and 12.6 mg/m² per dose for the oral solution.  Geriatric patients or those with adverse reactions may require a lower starting dose.  Off-label use in refractory cases may involve different dosing regimens.

* **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (Off-label):**  Dosages range from 2.5 mg to 10 mg, taken one hour before bedtime.  Higher doses require careful escalation under medical supervision.

**Children:**

Dronabinol is only approved for use in children and adolescents with refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  Dosage is calculated based on body surface area, similar to adult dosing in this indication.  It is crucial to start with the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for side effects.  The oral solution is not approved for pediatric patients.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of dronabinol can include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Euphoria
* Confusion

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Dronabinol is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis.  It works by binding to cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in the brain and other parts of the body.  Activation of these receptors can lead to various effects, including appetite stimulation, reduced nausea and vomiting, and changes in mood and perception.  The exact mechanisms through which it achieves its therapeutic effects are not fully understood, but involve complex interactions within the nervous system.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dronabinol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or its components, and in those taking certain medications such as disulfiram or metronidazole (with the oral solution) concurrently.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Dronabinol can interact with numerous other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver. This can affect either the effectiveness of dronabinol or the other medications involved. It is vital to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements and herbal remedies you take.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dronabinol should be avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of dronabinol, particularly those affecting the central nervous system.

* **Children:**  Children may also be more susceptible to the central nervous system side effects of this medication.

* **Patients with Psychiatric History:**  Individuals with a history of psychosis, schizophrenia, or other mental health conditions should use caution, as dronabinol can potentially worsen these conditions.

* **Substance Abuse History:**  Patients with a history of substance abuse should be carefully monitored as dronabinol can be habit-forming.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Dronabinol can impair judgment, coordination, and reaction time. Avoid driving, operating machinery or engaging in other activities requiring alertness until its effects are known.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Dronabinol to work?**  A: The onset of action varies depending on the condition and the individual.  For nausea and vomiting, effects may be seen within a few hours. For appetite stimulation, it may take longer.

* **Q: How should I store Dronabinol?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Dronabinol suddenly?** A:  No, abrupt cessation, especially after long-term use or high doses, can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as sleep disturbances.  Always consult your doctor before stopping.

* **Q: Is Dronabinol addictive?** A:  Yes, with prolonged use, tolerance and psychological and physical dependence can occur.  It's crucial to take it only as prescribed.
