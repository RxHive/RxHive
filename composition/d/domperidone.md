# Domperidone

**Generic Name:** Domperidone

**Usage:**

Domperidone is primarily used to treat symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders, specifically:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** It can help relieve nausea and vomiting caused by various conditions, including those related to gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying), chemotherapy, or post-operative recovery.
* **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms:** While not a first-line treatment, it can help alleviate symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation in some individuals, often in conjunction with other medications.
* **Functional dyspepsia:**  It may be used to improve symptoms of indigestion and upper abdominal discomfort in people with functional dyspepsia.
* **Postpartum lactation:**  Although increasingly restricted, it may be used to increase breast milk production in nursing mothers who are experiencing insufficient lactation.  This use is becoming less common due to safety concerns.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, but can include:

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):** These are neurological side effects that affect movement and can include restlessness, muscle stiffness, tremors, and involuntary movements. These are more common in higher doses or in individuals with pre-existing conditions.
* **Galactorrhea (breast milk production):**  May occur in both men and women, even in the absence of pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation):** Primarily in women.
* **Hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin levels):** This is a hormonal change which can lead to other side effects like galactorrhea and amenorrhea.
* **Drowsiness or dizziness:** Relatively uncommon.
* **Headache:** Relatively uncommon.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:**  Relatively uncommon.
* **Dry mouth:**  Relatively uncommon.


**How it Works:**

Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist. It works primarily by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain and in the gastrointestinal tract.  By blocking dopamine, it helps reduce nausea and vomiting signals. It also stimulates motility (movement) in the upper gastrointestinal tract, accelerating gastric emptying and improving the transit of food through the stomach.  This action helps to alleviate symptoms of indigestion and reflux.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Domperidone safe?**  Domperidone carries a risk of potentially serious side effects, particularly cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), especially at high doses or with prolonged use.  Its use is often restricted, and it's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription and dosage guidelines precisely.  The risk is higher in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Can I take Domperidone with other medications?**  It's important to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as Domperidone can interact with some drugs, including certain antifungals and antibiotics.
* **How long can I take Domperidone?** The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated and should be determined by your doctor.  Long-term use should be carefully monitored.
* **Can I take Domperidone during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** The use of Domperidone during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally avoided unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Always consult your doctor.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any concerning side effects, such as rapid heartbeat, dizziness, or unusual movements, contact your doctor immediately.
