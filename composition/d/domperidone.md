# Domperidone
### Generic Name
Domperidone

### Usage
Domperidone is primarily used to treat symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders.  These disorders affect how food moves through the digestive system.  Specifically, it helps manage conditions like chronic and subacute gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) and diabetic gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying in people with diabetes).  It's also effective in preventing or reducing nausea and vomiting associated with certain anti-Parkinson's medications that use dopamine agonists (medications that stimulate dopamine receptors).  Domperidone works by improving the movement of food through the esophagus and stomach, ultimately aiding in gastric emptying.


### Dosage
**Adults:** For GI motility disorders or nausea/vomiting related to anti-Parkinson's medications, the usual adult dose is 10 mg three times a day (TID).  The maximum daily dose is 30 mg.  It's crucial to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time possible.

**Children (aged 12 years and older):**  Dosage is weight-based. For those weighing less than 35 kg, the dose is 0.25 mg/kg per dose up to three times a day, with a maximum daily dose of less than 0.75 mg/kg or 30 mg total.  For children weighing more than 35 kg, the dose is 10 mg TID, with a maximum of 30 mg daily.  A suspension formulation is often used for children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For those with mild hepatic (liver) impairment, dosage adjustments aren't specified in manufacturer's labeling but caution is advised.  Domperidone is contraindicated in individuals with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for renal (kidney) impairment, but depending on severity, the frequency might be reduced to once or twice daily, and dose reduction should be considered with repeated use.

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.  Serious side effects, although less common, can include life-threatening arrhythmias.


### How it Works
Domperidone is a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the effects of dopamine in the peripheral nervous system (outside the brain). It doesn't readily cross the blood-brain barrier, minimizing central nervous system side effects.  Domperidone's action improves esophageal peristalsis (muscle contractions in the esophagus), increases lower esophageal sphincter pressure, enhances gastric motility and peristalsis (stomach muscle contractions), and improves gastroduodenal coordination. These combined effects accelerate gastric emptying and reduce small bowel transit time.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Domperidone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components; prolactin-releasing pituitary tumors (prolactinomas); known prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals (especially QT); significant electrolyte imbalances; underlying cardiac disease (e.g., heart failure); moderate or severe hepatic impairment; GI hemorrhage, obstruction, or perforation; and concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (like azole antifungals, macrolides, protease inhibitors, or nefazodone) or QT-prolonging drugs.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of altered cardiac conduction (QTc prolongation, life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, cardiac arrest), and elevated prolactin levels (possibly manifesting as galactorrhea, gynecomastia, amenorrhea, or impotence).

**Use with caution:** In patients with a personal or family history of breast cancer, severe renal impairment, or mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Avoid concurrent use with grapefruit juice.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I take Domperidone?** A: Typically, for GI motility disorders, take Domperidone 15-30 minutes before meals and at bedtime if needed.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: Can I take Domperidone while pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  The safety of Domperidone during pregnancy is unknown.  Domperidone is excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking this medication.  The off-label use to increase milk production is discouraged due to cardiac risks.

* **Q: How should I store Domperidone?** A: Store Domperidone as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose.
