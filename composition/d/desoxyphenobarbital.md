# Desoxyphenobarbital
### Generic Name
Desoxyphenobarbital

### Usage
Desoxyphenobarbital is primarily used to treat seizure disorders, specifically psychomotor, focal, and grand mal seizures.  It's also indicated for the treatment of partial seizures.  A notable secondary use is in managing essential tremor.  It's important to understand that desoxyphenobarbital's use should always be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional due to its potential side effects and interactions with other medications.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage regimen.

* **Seizure Disorders (Oral):**  The initial dose is typically low and gradually increased over several days or weeks.  The maintenance dose can range from 250mg three to four times daily to a maximum of 2g per day, depending on individual needs and response.  For patients already on other anticonvulsants, a gradual transition to desoxyphenobarbital monotherapy should occur over at least two weeks.

* **Partial Seizures (Oral):** Initial dose: 125mg daily at bedtime, increasing every three days by 125mg until reaching 250mg twice daily.  Maximum daily dose: 500mg.

* **Essential Tremor (Oral):** Initial dose: 12.5-25mg daily at bedtime.  The dose is gradually increased over 2-3 weeks to a maintenance dose of 250mg daily or divided into two doses. Maximum daily dose: 750mg.

**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):** Dosage is determined by the child's weight and age, and should always be determined and monitored by a physician.  Neonates, children under 8, and children 8 and older all have different dosing regimens. Consult a physician for appropriate dosages.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary in cases of renal or hepatic impairment.  Specific adjustments depend on creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels and are best determined in consultation with a physician.  Individuals undergoing hemodialysis require supplemental doses.

### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Ataxia, drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo, nystagmus, headache, excitement, hyperactivity, depression, confusion, irritability, dysarthria, paresthesia.
* **Less Common (Frequency not defined):** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, megaloblastic anemia, hypocalcemia, hepatotoxicity, rickets, osteomalacia, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute psychosis.

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Desoxyphenobarbital's exact mechanism isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to work by decreasing neuronal excitability, increasing synaptic inhibition through GABA receptor modulation, and inhibiting high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. These actions help control seizures and reduce the tremor associated with essential tremor.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Desoxyphenobarbital is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to desoxyphenobarbital or phenobarbital, and in those with porphyria.
* **Warnings and Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with depression, pulmonary impairment, hypoadrenalism, or those taking CNS depressants.  It increases the risk of hyperexcitability in children, fetal hemorrhage, and oral contraceptive failure.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Desoxyphenobarbital is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Can I take desoxyphenobarbital with food?**  It can be taken with or without food, but taking it with food or milk may reduce stomach upset.

* **How should I store desoxyphenobarbital?**  Store as directed by your doctor or pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Can I stop taking desoxyphenobarbital suddenly?** No, abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous. Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking desoxyphenobarbital?** No, avoid alcohol as it can enhance the sedative effects of desoxyphenobarbital.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double the dose.  If you have concerns, consult your doctor.

* **Are there any interactions with other medications?** Yes, many potential drug interactions exist.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
