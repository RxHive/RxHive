# Desloratadine + Montelukast
### Generic Name: Desloratadine + Montelukast

This combination medication isn't typically found as a single, pre-mixed generic product. Desloratadine and montelukast are usually prescribed as separate medications.  However, it's common for doctors to prescribe them together to manage certain allergic conditions.  This information describes each drug individually, as they would be used in combination.


### Usage

**Desloratadine:** This is a non-sedating antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (hives).  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This reduces symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives.

**Montelukast:** This is a leukotriene modifier. Leukotrienes are substances in the body that cause inflammation and constriction of the airways. Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, reducing inflammation and making breathing easier.  It's primarily used to prevent and treat asthma and to treat allergic rhinitis.


### Dosage

**Desloratadine:**

* **Adults and children 12 years and older:** The usual dose is one 5 mg tablet once daily.
* **Children 6-11 years:** The usual dose is 2.5 mg once daily.  (Note:  A lower dose formulation is needed for this age group;  check your pharmacy for the appropriate dosage form)
* **Children under 6:** Desloratadine is usually not recommended.
* **Oral Administration:** Tablets are taken orally with or without food.

**Montelukast:**

* **Adults and children 15 years and older:** The usual dose is one 10 mg tablet once daily, usually in the evening.
* **Children 6-14 years:** The usual dose is 5 mg once daily in the evening.  (Chewable tablets are available)
* **Children 2-5 years:** The usual dose is 4 mg once daily in the evening. (Granules are often used for easier administration)
* **Children under 2 years:** Montelukast is usually not recommended.
* **Oral Administration:**  Tablets should be swallowed whole. Chewable tablets should be thoroughly chewed before swallowing. Granules can be mixed with a spoonful of food (e.g., applesauce) and administered immediately.

**Important Note:**  The specific dosages of Desloratadine and Montelukast when used in combination should always be determined by a physician based on the individual's needs and medical history.


### Side Effects

**Desloratadine:** Common side effects are generally mild and include headache, drowsiness (although less common than with other antihistamines), fatigue, and dry mouth.  Rare but more serious side effects can include rapid heartbeat and allergic reactions.

**Montelukast:** Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain.  Less common but potentially serious side effects may include depression, anxiety, and behavioral changes (especially in children).  Rare cases of serious liver problems have also been reported.


### How it Works

**Desloratadine:**  Blocks histamine receptors in the body, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic symptoms like itching, sneezing, and inflammation.

**Montelukast:** Blocks leukotriene receptors, preventing leukotrienes from causing inflammation and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways).  This reduces swelling and improves airflow in the lungs.


### Precautions

* **Desloratadine:** Should be used cautiously in patients with kidney or liver disease. Inform your doctor if you have a history of heart problems or are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Montelukast:** Should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease or a history of mental health issues.  Inform your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have a history of seizures.  Sudden cessation of treatment should be avoided.
* **Interactions:**  Both medications can interact with other drugs.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking.  This includes prescription and over-the-counter drugs, supplements and herbal remedies.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or a severe rash.
