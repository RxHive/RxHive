# Desloratadine + Montelukast

**Generic Name:** Desloratadine/Montelukast

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic urticaria (hives) in adults and children (age limitations vary depending on specific formulation; consult product labeling).  It's often prescribed for patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by either desloratadine or montelukast alone.  It's important to note that this is not an approved fixed-dose combination in all countries; availability may vary.  Always consult a doctor before using this combination.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual response and dosage. Common side effects can include:

* **Desloratadine related:** Headache, drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness.
* **Montelukast related:** Headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, increased liver enzymes (rare but important to monitor),  sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares),  behavioral changes (especially in children, such as agitation, aggression, anxiety, depression, or suicidal ideation - though rare).

Serious, though rare, side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.  This list is not exhaustive, and you should refer to the medication's package insert for a complete list.

**How it Works:** This combination works by targeting different aspects of allergic reactions:

* **Desloratadine:** This is a second-generation antihistamine. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. Histamine causes many of the symptoms of allergies like sneezing, runny nose, itching, and hives.

* **Montelukast:** This is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Leukotrienes are substances that contribute to inflammation and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways) involved in allergic reactions.  Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, reducing inflammation and improving breathing.

By combining these two mechanisms, the medication aims to provide broader relief from allergy symptoms than either drug alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination better than taking each drug separately?** For some individuals, the combination may offer better symptom control than using each medication individually. However, this needs to be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response.  Using both separately may be equally effective or even preferable for some.

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  You should always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Can I stop taking this medication abruptly?**  You should follow your doctor's instructions regarding when and how to stop taking this medication.  Stopping suddenly may not be advisable.

* **Are there any precautions I should take?**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with liver or kidney problems, and children should consult their doctor before taking this medication.  This medication may cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
