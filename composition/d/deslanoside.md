# Deslanoside
### Generic Name
Deslanoside

### Usage
Deslanoside, a cardiac glycoside derived from *Digitalis lanata*, is primarily used to treat supraventricular arrhythmias caused by re-entry mechanisms.  This means it helps correct irregular heartbeats originating above the ventricles.  Specifically, it's effective in managing atrial fibrillation (irregular and rapid heartbeat in the atria) and controlling the ventricular rate in such cases.  Deslanoside also plays a role in the treatment of congestive heart failure by improving the heart's contractility.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.

**Adults (Cardiac arrhythmias; congestive heart failure):**  Deslanoside is typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Up to 1.6 mg can be given as a single dose or in divided doses. Maintenance treatment with an oral cardiac glycoside might begin within 12 hours of parenteral digitalization with Deslanoside. The maximum daily dose is 2 mg.

**Children (Cardiac arrhythmias; congestive heart failure):** Dosage is calculated based on weight and age, and is given intravenously or intramuscularly.  Precise dosages vary greatly depending on the child's age and renal function.  Premature infants, neonates, and children with decreased renal function may receive 0.02-0.022 mg/kg as a single dose (in emergencies) or divided into 2-3 doses over several hours.  Dosages for older children are also weight-based, with the physician determining the appropriate amount and frequency.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal impairment significantly impacts Deslanoside elimination; therefore, the maintenance dose should be reduced in patients with kidney dysfunction.  Hepatic (liver) impairment does not have a specified dosage adjustment.  Deslanoside is not effectively removed by dialysis.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nervous system: Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, confusion, disorientation, visual disturbances, and in severe cases, hallucinations or convulsions.
* Cardiovascular: Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), changes in heart rate, low blood pressure (especially with rapid IV injection).
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite (anorexia), abdominal pain.
* Other: Weakness, gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males), hypokalemia (low potassium levels).


Serious, but less common, side effects require immediate medical attention.  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works
Deslanoside's mechanism involves inhibiting the sodium-potassium-ATPase pump in heart muscle cells. This inhibition leads to increased intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. The increased calcium boosts the heart's contractility (force of contraction), resulting in a stronger heartbeat.  Additionally, Deslanoside influences the heart's electrical activity, affecting the speed and rhythm of heartbeats.

### Precautions
Deslanoside is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, ventricular fibrillation, and uncontrolled ventricular tachycardia (unless caused by congestive heart failure and not directly by Deslanoside).  Use with caution in patients with other heart conditions, renal or hepatic impairment, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hypoxia, hypothyroidism, and in elderly or very young patients.  Pregnancy category C means the risk to the fetus is not fully established.  Breastfeeding mothers should use it cautiously.  

Deslanoside interacts significantly with several medications including diuretics, corticosteroids, certain antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Deslanoside?** A: Follow your doctorâ€™s instructions and store the medication as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Deslanoside suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Deslanoside can be dangerous.  Always consult with your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not try to catch up by doubling the dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention.
