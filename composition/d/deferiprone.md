# Deferiprone
### Generic Name
Deferiprone

### Usage
Deferiprone is primarily used to treat transfusional iron overload in patients with thalassemia syndromes.  This occurs when repeated blood transfusions, necessary to manage the anemia associated with thalassemia, lead to a buildup of iron in the body.  This excess iron can damage vital organs. Deferiprone helps remove this excess iron.  It's important to note that the safety and effectiveness of deferiprone for treating iron overload in patients with other chronic anemias haven't been fully established.

### Dosage
Deferiprone dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's weight, the severity of iron overload, and their response to treatment.  There are different formulations available, including oral solutions (100 mg/mL) and oral tablets (500 mg).  Dosage instructions vary depending on the formulation.


**Adult Dosage (Transfusional Iron Overload due to Thalassemia Syndrome):**

* **Oral Solution (100 mg/mL):** The initial dose is typically 25 mg/kg three times daily (TID), totaling 75 mg/kg/day. The maximum dose is 33 mg/kg TID (99 mg/kg/day).  The dose is adjusted based on individual response and therapeutic goals, aiming for iron burden maintenance or reduction.  The dose should be rounded to the nearest 2.5 mL.

* **Oral Tablets (500 mg, thrice-daily):**  The initial dose is 75 mg/kg/day (actual body weight) TID. The maximum dose is 99 mg/kg/day (actual body weight) TID.  Dosage adjustments are made based on individual response and therapeutic goals.  The dose should be rounded to the nearest 500 mg (half-tablet).

* **Oral Tablets (500 mg, twice-daily):** The initial dose is 75 mg/kg/day (actual body weight) BID, taken approximately 12 hours apart with food. The maximum dose is 99 mg/kg/day (actual body weight) BID, taken approximately 12 hours apart with food. Dosage adjustments are made based on individual response and therapeutic goals.  The total daily dose should be rounded to the nearest 500 mg (half-tablet).


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of deferiprone in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary in cases of hepatic or renal impairment, but specific guidelines aren't provided in manufacturer labeling for these situations.  If hepatotoxicity occurs (persistent increase in liver enzymes), treatment should be interrupted.  If a patient develops neutropenia (low white blood cell count), treatment interruption is crucial, and the decision to resume treatment depends on a careful risk-benefit assessment.

### Side Effects
Deferiprone can cause several side effects, ranging in severity.  Always consult a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Urine discoloration
* Headache
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain or distress
* Diarrhea
* Changes in appetite (increased or decreased)
* Weight gain or loss
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Back pain
* Limb pain


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count) – a potentially life-threatening condition that increases the risk of infection.
* Agranulocytosis (severe lack of white blood cells) – a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST) – indicating potential liver damage.
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions).


Many other less frequent side effects have been reported, including various gastrointestinal, neurological, hematological, and dermatological issues.


### How it Works
Deferiprone is an iron chelator.  This means it binds to iron in the body, forming a complex that can be excreted in the urine. By effectively binding and removing excess iron, it helps prevent or reduce damage to organs caused by iron overload.  Deferiprone has a high affinity for ferric iron (Fe3+).

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Deferiprone is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components and in those with severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm³).
* **Drug Interactions:** Deferiprone's effects may be decreased by products containing polyvalent cations (like iron, aluminum, zinc).  Its effects may be increased by myelosuppressive agents and UGT1A6 inhibitors.
* **Warnings:**  Agranulocytosis/neutropenia is a serious risk; regular monitoring of blood counts is essential.  Deferiprone can cause hepatotoxicity (liver damage); liver function tests should be monitored regularly.  There's an increased risk of zinc deficiency.  Deferiprone is categorized as Pregnancy Category D; it should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for six months after treatment; males with female partners of reproductive potential should use contraception during treatment and for three months after treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Deferiprone?** A: Store Deferiprone as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.


* **Q: Can I take other medications with Deferiprone?** A: Always inform your doctor about all medications you're taking to avoid potential interactions.


* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** A: Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.


* **Q: How often should I have blood tests?** A: Blood tests (complete blood counts, liver function tests, serum ferritin) will be scheduled by your doctor, typically at regular intervals to monitor your blood counts and liver function.
