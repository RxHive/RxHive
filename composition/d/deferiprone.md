# Deferiprone

**Generic Name:** Deferiprone

**Usage:** Deferiprone is used to treat iron overload in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and other anemias where frequent blood transfusions are necessary. It's primarily used when other iron chelation therapies, such as deferoxamine or deferasirox, are ineffective or poorly tolerated.

**Side Effects:** Deferiprone can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, headache, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain).
* **Serious:** Agranulocytosis (a severe decrease in white blood cells increasing risk of infection), neutropenia (low neutrophil count), hepatotoxicity (liver damage),  skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis â€“ very rare but potentially life-threatening), cardiovascular events (rare but possible), and gastrointestinal bleeding.  Regular blood tests to monitor blood counts and liver function are crucial while taking deferiprone.


**How it Works:** Deferiprone is an oral iron chelator.  This means it binds to iron in the body and helps to remove it through the urine.  Unlike some other chelators, it's effective at removing iron from various tissues, including the heart, liver, and pancreas.  The iron-deferiprone complex is then excreted via the kidneys.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often do I need blood tests while taking deferiprone?**  A:  Your doctor will determine the frequency of blood tests, but it will likely be frequent (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) initially to monitor for side effects, particularly agranulocytosis and liver function abnormalities.  Frequency may decrease once you are stable on the medication.

* **Q: Can I take deferiprone with other medications?** A:  You should inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions are possible, and some medications should be avoided while on deferiprone.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience fever, chills, sore throat, mouth sores, unusual bleeding or bruising, jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), severe abdominal pain, or any other severe or unusual symptoms.

* **Q: Is deferiprone safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  The safety of deferiprone during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking it if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
