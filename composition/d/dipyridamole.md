# Dipyridamole
### Generic Name
Dipyridamole

### Usage
Dipyridamole is primarily used in two distinct ways:

1. **Thromboembolism Prophylaxis:**  It's used in conjunction with warfarin to help prevent blood clots from forming in patients who've had artificial heart valves implanted. This combination reduces the risk of potentially life-threatening thromboembolic events.

2. **Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Prevention:**  Specifically, the *extended-release* formulation of dipyridamole is used in combination with aspirin to help prevent future strokes or TIAs in individuals who have already experienced these events. This secondary prevention strategy aims to reduce the risk of recurrence.

Additionally, dipyridamole injection serves as a diagnostic tool in evaluating coronary artery disease (CAD).  It's administered intravenously as part of a stress test to assess blood flow to the heart.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use:

* **Thromboembolism Prophylaxis (Post-Valve Replacement):**
    * **Immediate-release tablets:** 75-100 mg four times a day (QID).
    * **Extended-release capsules:** 200 mg twice a day (BID).

* **Stroke/TIA Prevention (Secondary):**
    * **Extended-release capsules:** 200 mg twice a day (BID), *always in combination with aspirin*.

* **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Evaluation (Intravenous):**
    * 0.56 mg/kg over a four-minute period. The maximum dose is 70 mg.  A radiotracer (like thallium-201) is injected 3-5 minutes after the dipyridamole infusion is complete.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of dipyridamole in children under 12 years of age have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Dipyridamole is not removed by hemodialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Oral):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Abdominal distress
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Oral & IV):**

* Angina pectoris (chest pain)
* Flushing
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hepatic insufficiency (liver failure)
* Allergic reactions (including potentially life-threatening ones)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


**Intravenous Administration Specific Side Effects:**  Intravenous administration may also cause exacerbation of angina, ECG abnormalities, nausea, and dyspnea (shortness of breath). A wide range of other less common side effects has been reported following intravenous use, including various cardiovascular and neurological events.


**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dipyridamole works through a complex mechanism involving the inhibition of enzymes (adenosine deaminase and phosphodiesterase). This inhibition leads to an accumulation of adenosine and other molecules that prevent platelets from clumping together (platelet aggregation).  It also has vasodilatory effects, widening blood vessels, particularly in the coronary arteries.  These combined actions reduce the risk of blood clots and improve blood flow.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Dipyridamole is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.  It is also relatively contraindicated in patients with a very slow heart rate, certain types of heart block, seizure disorders (if they cannot take aminophylline), and severe aortic stenosis.  For stress testing with dipyridamole, further contraindications exist, including bronchospastic lung disease, low blood pressure, uncontrolled hypertension, and recent ingestion of caffeine.

* **Drug Interactions:** Dipyridamole can interact with numerous other medications, including those affecting blood clotting, blood pressure, and heart function.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Use in Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised when using dipyridamole in patients with low blood pressure, unstable angina, recent heart attack, liver problems, and those taking other medications affecting platelet function or blood clotting.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew the extended-release capsules?** A: No, the extended-release capsules should be swallowed whole to maintain the intended release profile of the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store dipyridamole?** A: Store it according to the instructions on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking dipyridamole?** A:  While there aren't specific dietary restrictions, limiting caffeine intake before stress testing is important.

* **Q: How long will it take for dipyridamole to work?** A: The time it takes for dipyridamole to show effects varies depending on the formulation and the condition itâ€™s treating. For prophylactic purposes, the effects are gradual.  For diagnostic use, the effects are more immediate.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately, especially if you have serious side effects.  Your doctor will assess the situation and provide appropriate guidance.
