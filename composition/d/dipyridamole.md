# Dipyridamole

**Generic Name:** Dipyridamole

**Usage:**

Dipyridamole is used to prevent blood clots in people who have had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA, or "mini-stroke").  It's also used in combination with other medications (specifically, to enhance the effectiveness of adenosine) during certain types of cardiac stress tests (e.g., myocardial perfusion imaging, MPI) to improve the visualization of blood flow in the heart.  The use of dipyridamole in preventing strokes or TIAs is becoming less common as newer antiplatelet agents have shown better efficacy.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of dipyridamole can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing (redness of the skin)
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Chest pain (angina)


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Rapid or irregular heartbeat
* Low blood pressure
* Severe stomach pain
* Bloody or black, tarry stools (indicating bleeding)


**How it Works:**

Dipyridamole works by inhibiting the uptake of adenosine by red blood cells.  Adenosine is a naturally occurring substance that helps relax blood vessels. By preventing the breakdown of adenosine, dipyridamole increases the amount of adenosine available, promoting vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This improves blood flow and reduces the tendency for blood to clot.  In the context of stress testing, this enhanced vasodilation makes blood flow abnormalities more readily apparent on imaging.  In the prevention of strokes, its antiplatelet effects (inhibiting platelet aggregation) contribute to reduced clot formation.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take dipyridamole with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting dipyridamole.  Interactions can occur, especially with anticoagulants (blood thinners) and medications that affect blood pressure.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking dipyridamole?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption should generally be avoided while taking dipyridamole, as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular system.  Consult your doctor for guidance on alcohol intake.
* **Q:  How long will I need to take dipyridamole?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the reason for taking the medication and will be determined by your doctor.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.  For less severe side effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
