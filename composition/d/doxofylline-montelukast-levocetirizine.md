# Doxofylline + Montelukast + Levocetirizine
### Generic Name
Doxofylline + Montelukast + Levocetirizine

**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination available in most markets.  The information below describes the individual components and their potential use in combination, *not* a commercially available product.  Prescribing this combination requires careful consideration by a physician based on individual patient needs and potential drug interactions.


### Usage

This combination of Doxofylline, Montelukast, and Levocetirizine is sometimes used off-label to manage symptoms of moderate to severe asthma and allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  Let's look at each component individually:

* **Doxofylline:** A bronchodilator that relaxes the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier.  It's primarily used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

* **Montelukast:** A leukotriene receptor antagonist. Leukotrienes are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of airways). Montelukast blocks these substances, reducing inflammation and improving airflow.  It's commonly used to prevent asthma attacks and manage allergic rhinitis.

* **Levocetirizine:** An antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. Histamine causes symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Levocetirizine helps relieve these symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis and urticaria (hives).


In combination, these drugs aim to provide a multi-pronged approach to managing both the bronchoconstriction (tightening of airways) and inflammatory responses, and allergic symptoms associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis.



### Dosage

**Because this is not a standard fixed-dose combination, there is no established dosage.**  A physician would determine the appropriate dosage of each component individually based on the patient's age, weight, condition severity, and response to treatment.  Dosage information for each drug individually follows:

* **Doxofylline:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation and the physician's prescription.  Oral dosages are usually determined based on individual need.

* **Montelukast:**  The usual dose for adults and children 12 years and older is one 10mg tablet once daily in the evening.  Children aged 6-14 years may receive a 5mg chewable tablet once daily in the evening.  Different formulations and dosages exist for younger children.

* **Levocetirizine:** The typical adult dose is 5mg once daily.  Children's dosage varies based on age and weight; a doctor will provide specific guidance.


**Administration:** Doxofylline is usually taken orally. Montelukast is available in tablets and chewable tablets (for children), taken orally. Levocetirizine is typically administered orally in tablet or syrup form.

### How it Works

Each drug works through a different mechanism:

* **Doxofylline:** Relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow.

* **Montelukast:** Blocks leukotriene receptors, reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction in the airways.

* **Levocetirizine:** Blocks histamine receptors, thereby reducing allergy symptoms.
