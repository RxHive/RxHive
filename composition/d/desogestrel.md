# Desogestrel
### Generic Name
Desogestrel

### Usage
Desogestrel is primarily used as a female hormonal contraceptive.  It works by preventing pregnancy through a combination of mechanisms: suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg), and thinning the uterine lining (making it less hospitable for a fertilized egg to implant).  While its main purpose is contraception, it's not typically used for other medical conditions.


### Dosage
Desogestrel is administered orally as a 75 mcg tablet.  Dosage instructions vary depending on the patient's history and the context of use:

* **Contraception (in females):**
    * **No prior hormonal contraceptive use:** One 75 mcg tablet daily, starting on day 1 of the menstrual cycle (first day of bleeding).  Starting on days 2-5 is acceptable, but a backup contraceptive method (e.g., condoms) should be used for the first 7 days.
    * **After first-trimester abortion:** One 75 mcg tablet daily, starting immediately.  No additional contraceptive method is needed.
    * **After delivery or second-trimester abortion:** One 75 mcg tablet daily, starting between days 21-28 postpartum or post-abortion. If starting later than day 28, a backup contraceptive method should be used for the first 7 days.  A pregnancy test is recommended if intercourse occurred before starting treatment.
    * **Switching from other contraceptives:**  The specific timing depends on the previous method (refer to the prescribing information for details). Generally, switching from other progestogen-only methods can be done anytime, but switching from combined methods (estrogen and progestogen) may require a specific starting day.
    * **Missed dose (<12 hours late):** Take the tablet as soon as possible, then resume the regular schedule.
    * **Missed dose (>12 hours late):** Skip the missed dose and resume the regular schedule.  Use a backup contraceptive method for the next 7 days.

* **Pediatric use:** The safety and efficacy of Desogestrel in children have not been established.

### How it Works
Desogestrel is a progestin (a type of progestogen). Its active metabolite, etonogestrel, works primarily by suppressing ovulation, making it unlikely that an egg will be released.  It also thickens cervical mucus, creating a barrier to sperm, and alters the uterine lining, making implantation of a fertilized egg less likely.


### Precautions
Desogestrel is contraindicated in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity to desogestrel or any of its components.
* History of arterial or venous thromboembolism (blood clots).
* Unexplained vaginal bleeding.
* Known or suspected progestogen-dependent malignancies (cancers).
* Severe liver disease.
* History of/active breast cancer.
* Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure).
* Diabetes mellitus with vascular involvement.
* Migraine with aura.

Desogestrel should be used with caution in individuals with:

* Cardiovascular disease.
* Diabetes.
* History of ectopic pregnancy.
* Active liver disease.
* Malabsorption syndromes.
* Conditions worsened by fluid retention.


Desogestrel may interact with enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., some anticonvulsants), potentially reducing its effectiveness.  It may also interact with cyclosporine.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before using Desogestrel; it is categorized as Pregnancy Category X (contraindicated during pregnancy).
