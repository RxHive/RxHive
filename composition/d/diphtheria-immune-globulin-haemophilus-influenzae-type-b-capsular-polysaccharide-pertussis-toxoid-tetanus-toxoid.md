# Diphtheria Immune Globulin + Haemophilus Influenzae Type B Capsular Polysaccharide + Pertussis Toxoid + Tetanus Toxoid

There is no single generic combination product containing Diphtheria Immune Globulin (DIG), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) capsular polysaccharide, Pertussis toxoid, and Tetanus toxoid.  These are all components of various childhood vaccines, but they are not typically combined in a single injection.  They are administered separately or in various combinations as part of a broader immunization schedule.


Therefore, I cannot provide details in the requested format for a non-existent generic combination product.  To get information, you would need to look up the specific vaccine products which contain one or more of these components individually.  For instance, you would find information on:

* **DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis):**  This vaccine contains toxoids of diphtheria and tetanus, and acellular pertussis components.
* **Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b):** This vaccine protects against Hib bacteria.  It's often given in conjunction with other vaccines.
* **DTaP-IPV-Hib:** This is a combination vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis toxoids, inactivated poliovirus, and Hib conjugate vaccine.

You should consult a doctor or refer to official vaccine information sources (like the CDC or your country's equivalent health authority) for accurate and detailed information about specific vaccines and their components.  They can provide details about usage, side effects, and mechanisms of action for the relevant vaccines.
