# Docosanol
### Generic Name
Docosanol

### Usage
Docosanol is a topical antiviral medication primarily used to treat acute outbreaks of recurrent oral-facial herpes simplex, commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters.  It's applied directly to the affected area of the skin.  Currently, there are no other approved uses for docosanol.

### Dosage
**Cold Sores/Fever Blisters:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥12 years:**  A 10% docosanol cream is applied five times daily to the affected area of the lips or face.  Treatment should begin at the very first sign of a cold sore or fever blister and continue until the lesion is completely healed.  If no improvement is seen within 10 days of starting treatment, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.


### Side Effects
The frequency of side effects is not well-defined in available information, however, the following has been reported:

*   Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)


Serious side effects are rare, but any unusual reaction should prompt a call to your doctor or other healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Docosanol works by preventing the herpes simplex virus from entering healthy cells.  It achieves this by inhibiting the fusion between the virus's envelope and the cell membrane. By blocking viral entry, docosanol limits viral replication and helps to shorten the duration and severity of a cold sore outbreak.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Docosanol should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to docosanol or any of the inactive ingredients in the formulation.

* **Allergic Reactions:** There's a potential for severe allergic reactions, so discontinue use and seek medical attention if any signs of an allergic reaction occur (e.g., rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety and effectiveness of docosanol during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.

* **Children:**  While docosanol is used in children aged 12 and older at the adult dosage, always consult a pediatrician before using any medication on a child.


* **Other Medications:**  Currently, there is no information suggesting interactions with other medications. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.

* **Application:** Docosanol is for external use only.  Avoid contact with eyes and mouth. Wash hands thoroughly before and after each application.  Apply only to the affected area.  Cosmetics can be used after the cream is completely absorbed, but use a separate applicator to prevent spreading the infection.

* **Benzyl Alcohol:** Some formulations may contain benzyl alcohol.  High doses of benzyl alcohol can be toxic, especially to newborns.
