# Dienogest + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Dienogest + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage

Dienogest and Ethinylestradiol is a combined oral contraceptive pill used primarily for preventing pregnancy.  It achieves this by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening cervical mucus to hinder sperm passage, and altering the uterine lining to make implantation less likely.  A secondary, approved use is the treatment of moderately severe acne in women who don't have contraindications for oral contraceptives and haven't responded to appropriate topical treatments.


### Dosage

**Contraception and Acne Treatment (Adults):**

The typical dose is one tablet daily, taken at approximately the same time each day, with or without food.  Each blister pack contains 21 tablets of Dienogest 2mg and Ethinylestradiol 0.03mg. After taking all 21 tablets, a 7-day break is observed during which a withdrawal bleed usually occurs. A new pack is started after the 7-day break, regardless of bleeding.  The contraceptive effect continues through the 7-day break.

**Children:**  This medication is not indicated for use in children before menarche (the onset of menstruation).

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dienogest and Ethinylestradiol is a combination hormonal contraceptive.  Ethinylestradiol is an estrogen, and dienogest is a progestogen.  These hormones work together to prevent pregnancy by multiple mechanisms. Primarily, they suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, preventing ovulation.  They also thicken the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and they alter the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.  The mechanism of action in treating acne is less understood, but it's believed to be related to the hormones' effects on sebum production (oil from the skin) and inflammation.

* Diabetes mellitus with vascular involvement
* History of migraine with aura
* Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding
* Benign or malignant liver tumors, hepatic impairment, or jaundice with prior oral contraceptive use

* History of pancreatitis associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia
* History of hepatic disease with abnormal liver function (including Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndrome)
* Undiagnosed amenorrhea
* Cerebrovascular disease, including existing stroke, and history of stroke or prodromal conditions (e.g., transient ischemic attack)


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of breast cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer, venous thromboembolism, hypertension, chloasma (skin discoloration), breakthrough bleeding/spotting, and hereditary angioedema.
* Use with caution in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, or prediabetes.
* Discontinue if signs of thromboembolism occur.
* Discontinue 4 weeks before major surgery or prolonged immobilization.
