# Dextran
### Generic Name
Dextran

### Usage
Dextran is a synthetic colloid and plasma volume expander primarily used in emergency situations to treat shock or impending shock when blood or blood products aren't readily available.  Its rapid expansion of blood volume helps restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion.  Beyond its primary use in shock management, dextran also finds applications as a priming fluid in heart-lung machines during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.  It's also used to distend the uterus during hysteroscopy (a procedure to examine the uterine cavity) and as a prophylaxis (preventative measure) against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), particularly following surgery.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific indication, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the condition.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions carefully.  Below are general guidelines, *not* a substitute for professional medical advice:


**Adults:**

* **Volume Expansion/Shock (IV):** Dextran 40: 500-1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg) infused as quickly as possible, but the maximum daily dose is 20 mL/kg for the first 24 hours, decreasing to 10 mL/kg thereafter. Treatment generally shouldn't exceed 5 days. Dextran 70: Total dosage shouldn't exceed 20 mL/kg in the first 24 hours.  In emergencies, 500 mL can be administered at a rate of 20-40 mL/min.
* **Cardiopulmonary Bypass (IV):**  Dextran 40: 10-20 mL/kg or 1-2 g/kg is added to the pump oxygenator.  The maximum total dose is typically 20 mL/kg or 2 g/kg.
* **Hysteroscopy (Intrauterine):** 32% Dextran 70 in dextrose is instilled into the uterine cavity to maintain a pressure of 50-100 mmHg.  Pressure shouldn't exceed 150 mmHg if a pump is used.
* **DVT/PE Prophylaxis (IV):** Dextran 70: 500-1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg) on the day of surgery, followed by 500 mL daily for 2-3 days, and then 500 mL every 2-3 days as needed for up to 2 weeks.


**Children:** Dosage and infusion rates are highly dependent on the child's fluid status and must be individualized by a healthcare professional.  General guidelines exist, but these must be adjusted based on the child's age, weight and specific condition.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dextran is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Therefore, dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment.  Caution is also warranted in patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Chest tightness
* Urticaria (hives)
* Wheezing


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Prolonged bleeding time
* Wound hemorrhage or hematoma
* Anaphylactoid reactions (severe allergic reactions)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Acute renal failure
* Abnormal liver function tests


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Dextran's large molecular structure allows it to remain in the bloodstream, increasing its volume and thus blood pressure. This increased volume improves tissue perfusion (blood flow to tissues) and helps counteract the effects of shock.  The different molecular weights of dextran (e.g., Dextran 40, Dextran 70) influence its duration of action in the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dextran is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to dextran, marked hemostatic defects (bleeding disorders), severe cardiac decompensation (heart failure), and severe renal disease with oliguria or anuria (reduced or absent urine production).
* **Interactions:**  Dextran may interact with enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) and enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine). Concomitant use should be avoided.
* **Warnings:** Dextran carries a risk of fluid overload, severe allergic reactions (anaphylactoid reactions), renal failure, and hematologic effects (particularly with large volumes).  Use with extreme caution in patients at risk of fluid overload (e.g., elderly, very young, heart failure patients), active hemorrhage, renal or hepatic impairment, and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should exercise particular caution and only use this medication under strict medical supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is Dextran a substitute for blood?** A: No, Dextran is a plasma volume expander and not a substitute for blood or blood components.
* **Q: How is Dextran stored?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided on the product labeling. Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using Dextran and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe side effects.
* **Q: Can I use Dextran without a doctor's prescription?** A: No, Dextran is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How long does it take for Dextran to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the administration method and the individual's condition, but the effects are generally seen relatively quickly.
