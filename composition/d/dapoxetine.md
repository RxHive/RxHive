# Dapoxetine

**Generic Name:** Dapoxetine

**Usage:** Dapoxetine is used to treat premature ejaculation (PE) in adult men.  It's specifically for men who consistently experience ejaculation within one minute of penetration and are distressed by this.  It is not a treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED).  A doctor will assess individual needs and prescribe accordingly.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Insomnia (difficulty sleeping)
* Fatigue (tiredness)
* Dry mouth
* Somnolence (sleepiness)


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Syncope (fainting)
* Seizures
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (although a causal link is not definitively established)
* Serotonin syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental state)


It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, sleep, and sexual function. By increasing serotonin levels, dapoxetine is thought to delay ejaculation by affecting the signals in the brain that trigger ejaculation.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood.
