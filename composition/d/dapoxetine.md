# Dapoxetine
### Generic Name
Dapoxetine

### Usage
Dapoxetine is primarily used to treat premature ejaculation (PE) in adult men aged 18 to 64 years.  PE is defined as the consistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before the man wishes. Dapoxetine helps to delay ejaculation, improving sexual satisfaction for both partners.  It's important to note that Dapoxetine is not a treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED).  It does not improve the ability to achieve an erection.

### Dosage
Dapoxetine is available as an oral tablet.  The dosage is individualized based on the patient's response and tolerability.

* **Adult Dosage (Premature Ejaculation):** The usual starting dose is 30 mg taken orally once every 24 hours, 1 to 3 hours before anticipated sexual activity. If this dose is well-tolerated and not effective enough, it *may* be increased to a maximum single dose of 60 mg once every 24 hours.  However, this increase should only occur if the 30mg dose is well-tolerated (meaning the absence of severe side effects or symptoms suggestive of fainting).  The medication is not meant for continuous daily use.  A healthcare professional will reassess the treatment after 4 weeks (or at least 6 doses) and at least every 6 months thereafter.  The dosage may need to be adjusted in individuals with impaired liver or kidney function, or those taking other medications (see Precautions).


* **Pediatric Dosage:** Dapoxetine is not recommended for use in children.

Rare but serious side effects, including suicidal thoughts, syncope (fainting), serotonin syndrome, and mania/hypomania, are possible.

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your doctor.


### How it Works
Dapoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain.  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating mood, sleep, and sexual function. By increasing serotonin levels, Dapoxetine is thought to help delay ejaculation. The precise mechanism by which it achieves this is not fully understood but involves interactions with serotonin receptors in the pathways involved in ejaculation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dapoxetine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components; a history of mania or severe depression; moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment; significant cardiac conditions (heart failure, conduction abnormalities, ischemic or valvular heart disease, history of syncope); concomitant use of MAO inhibitors, other SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, thioridazine, or serotonergic agents; or concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

* **Interactions:** Dapoxetine can interact with many other medications, including those affecting serotonin levels,  blood clotting, blood pressure, or those metabolized by the same liver enzymes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4).  It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Grapefruit juice should be avoided as it can increase Dapoxetine's blood levels.

* **Warnings:** Dapoxetine increases the risk of bleeding, central nervous system effects (dizziness, syncope), suicidal thoughts, bone fractures, ocular effects, SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), and serotonin syndrome. Use caution in patients with mild hepatic or renal impairment, a history of seizures, or those who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6. Dapoxetine is not for use in women and its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.

* **Alcohol:** Alcohol should be avoided while taking Dapoxetine as it may increase the risk of side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Dapoxetine to work?** A: Dapoxetine is taken 1-3 hours before sexual activity, as needed.


* **Q: Can I take Dapoxetine every day?** A: No, Dapoxetine is not intended for continuous daily use.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is very close to your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.


* **Q: How should I store Dapoxetine?** A: Store Dapoxetine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.


* **Q: Can I stop taking Dapoxetine suddenly?** A:  While it's not associated with the same significant withdrawal issues as some other antidepressants, it's advisable to discuss stopping the medication with your doctor. Sudden cessation of SSRIs can potentially lead to a discontinuation syndrome.


* **Q: Is Dapoxetine habit-forming?** A:  Dapoxetine does not have a high potential for physical dependence like some other medications.  However, it's important to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and not take more than recommended.


* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.
