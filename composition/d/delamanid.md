# Delamanid
### Generic Name
Delamanid

### Usage
Delamanid is an antituberculosis medication used to treat pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).  It's crucial to understand that Delamanid is not a standalone treatment; it's always used in combination with other anti-TB drugs as part of a comprehensive treatment regimen. This combination approach is necessary because MDR-TB bacteria are resistant to multiple standard TB medications. Delamanid is reserved for patients who are either resistant to or intolerant of more commonly used TB treatments.  It is a valuable addition to treatment options for this challenging form of the disease.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The standard dosage for pulmonary MDR-TB is 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks.  This is always administered under directly observed therapy (DOT), meaning a healthcare professional or designated observer must watch the patient take each dose to ensure adherence to the treatment plan.  The 24-week course of Delamanid is followed by continued treatment with other anti-TB drugs according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.

**Children and Adolescents:** The safety and efficacy of Delamanid have not been established in individuals younger than 18 years old.  It is not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment. However, Delamanid is not recommended for use in individuals with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  As with hepatic impairment, Delamanid is not recommended for those with severe renal impairment.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Insomnia
* Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
* Nausea

* Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
* Diarrhea
* Upper abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Reticulocytosis (increased number of immature red blood cells)
* Asthenia (weakness or fatigue)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Tremor
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**  These include but are not limited to QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm), various psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, psychosis),  liver problems (increased liver enzymes),  skin rashes, and various other effects.  A comprehensive list is available in the full prescribing information.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Delamanid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the cell wall of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  By disrupting the formation of these acids, Delamanid interferes with the bacteria's ability to maintain its structure and survive. This ultimately contributes to killing the TB bacteria.  It is important to note that the active metabolites of Delamanid are responsible for this anti-mycobacterial action.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Delamanid is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Delamanid or its components; those with serum albumin levels below 2.8 g/dL; patients concurrently using strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin); and pregnant or breastfeeding women.


**Warnings and Precautions:**  Delamanid can prolong the QT interval (a measure of heart rhythm on an ECG), increasing the risk of potentially fatal arrhythmias.  It should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing heart conditions, electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, magnesium, or calcium), or those taking other medications that prolong the QT interval.   It should also be used cautiously in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the elderly, and those with low serum albumin.   Patients should be monitored for CNS effects and should avoid tasks requiring alertness if experiencing such side effects.  Delamanid should be taken with food.


**Drug Interactions:**  The effectiveness of Delamanid can be reduced when used with strong CYP3A4 inducers like rifampicin. Concomitant use with moxifloxacin is not recommended.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Delamanid with other medications?** A:  Delamanid is always used in combination with other anti-TB drugs, but it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions can occur.


* **Q: How should I store Delamanid?** A:  Store Delamanid as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and light.


* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately. Do not try to double up on missed doses.


* **Q:  Is Delamanid safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: No.  It is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


* **Q:  How long does it take to see results from Delamanid?** A:  Delamanid is part of a longer treatment regimen for MDR-TB, and results will not be immediate.  Improvement is monitored through regular clinical evaluation and laboratory testing.
