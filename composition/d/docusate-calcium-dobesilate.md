# Docusate + Calcium Dobesilate
### Generic Name
Docusate Sodium + Calcium Dobesilate

**Note:**  Docusate sodium and calcium dobesilate are often combined in over-the-counter preparations, but this combination doesn't have a single, universally recognized generic name.  The names listed above reflect the individual components.  Always refer to the specific brand name and its labeling for accurate information.


### Usage

This combination medication treats constipation and associated symptoms, primarily by addressing two aspects of bowel function.  Docusate sodium is a stool softener. It works by increasing the water content in the stool, making it softer and easier to pass. Calcium dobesilate is a haemostatic agent, meaning it helps to reduce bleeding, particularly from hemorrhoids or other anal fissures that often accompany constipation. This combination is therefore beneficial for individuals experiencing constipation and related bleeding.  It is primarily used for the relief of constipation, especially in cases where straining during bowel movements might exacerbate hemorrhoidal bleeding.  It's not typically used to treat chronic constipation or severe cases requiring more intensive medical management.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the specific formulation and the manufacturer's instructions.  Always follow the directions on the product label.  There is no established pediatric dosing for this combination medication, and use in children should be under the direct guidance of a pediatrician.  Adult dosage typically involves taking one or two tablets or capsules as directed, usually once or twice daily.  The medication should be taken with a full glass of water.  There is no IV formulation of this combination.

**Important:**  Do not exceed the recommended dosage. Overuse of docusate can lead to electrolyte imbalances, and excessive use of any laxative can interfere with the body's natural bowel function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Mild abdominal cramping
* Mild diarrhea (usually resolves with dose adjustment)
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Severe abdominal pain
* Rectal bleeding (though sometimes this is reduced by the medication)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Electrolyte imbalances (with prolonged or excessive use of docusate)

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Docusate sodium works by lowering the surface tension of the stool. This allows more water to penetrate the stool, making it softer and easier to eliminate.  This reduces straining during bowel movements. Calcium dobesilate helps to reduce bleeding by promoting blood clotting in the affected areas, specifically in hemorrhoids and anal fissures.  The combined effect addresses both the constipation and the bleeding often associated with it.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to docusate sodium or calcium dobesilate.
* **Drug interactions:** While generally considered safe, potential interactions exist with some medications. Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you're taking other medications, especially anticoagulants (blood thinners), to avoid potential complications.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is it safe to use with other laxatives?** A:  It's generally not recommended to combine this medication with other laxatives without consulting a healthcare professional.  This can lead to excessive bowel movements and electrolyte imbalances.
