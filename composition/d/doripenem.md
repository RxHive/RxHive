# Doripenem
### Generic Name
Doripenem

### Usage
Doripenem is a powerful antibiotic belonging to the carbapenem class.  Its primary use is in treating serious bacterial infections.  Specifically, it's indicated for complicated intra-abdominal infections (infections within the abdomen) and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), including pyelonephritis (kidney infection). While not officially labeled for all uses, it's sometimes used off-label to treat intravenous catheter-related bloodstream infections.  The use of Doripenem should always be guided by a healthcare professional who can assess the severity of the infection and the individual patient's needs.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Doripenem is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated:

* **Complicated Intra-abdominal Infection:** 500 mg every 8 hours for 5-14 days.
* **Complicated Urinary Tract Infection (including pyelonephritis):** 500 mg every 8 hours for 10-14 days.  This treatment is usually reserved for patients who are critically ill or have risk factors for multi-drug resistant bacteria.
* **Intravenous Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (off-label):** 500 mg every 8 hours for 7-14 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (renal impairment). The specific adjustment depends on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate, a measure of kidney function:

* CrCl > 50 mL/min: No adjustment needed.
* CrCl 30-50 mL/min: 250 mg every 8 hours.
* CrCl 11-29 mL/min: 250 mg every 12 hours.
* End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on intermittent hemodialysis: 250 mg every 24 hours (or 500 mg every 12 hours on day 1, then 500 mg every 24 hours if treating *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection).
* Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD): 1000 mg every 8 hours.
* Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF): 250 mg every 12 hours.

Dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment are not typically required as Doripenem is minimally metabolized by the liver.  There is no established dosage for children.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Increased levels of liver enzymes


**Serious but Rare Side Effects (<1%, Post-marketing, and/or Case Reports):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Interstitial pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Renal failure or insufficiency
* Seizures
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reaction)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Doripenem is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) within bacteria, preventing the formation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls. This disruption ultimately leads to bacterial cell lysis (breakdown) and death.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Doripenem is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (severe allergic reaction) to Doripenem, other carbapenems, or any component of the formulation.  It should also be avoided in individuals who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics.

**Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., brain lesions, stroke, history of seizures), as Doripenem can increase the risk of seizures.  Close monitoring is also necessary in patients with renal impairment, as dosage adjustments are crucial to prevent toxicity.  There's a risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria with prolonged use or inappropriate use of antibiotics, and a risk of superinfections (new infections caused by different organisms).

**Drug Interactions:** Doripenem can interact with other medications.  It may decrease the effectiveness of certain vaccines and other drugs, while probenecid may increase Doripenem levels. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Doripenem is categorized as pregnancy category B. This means that animal studies have not shown a risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised when using Doripenem during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Doripenem administered?** A: Doripenem is given intravenously (IV) over a period of one hour.
* **Q: How should I store Doripenem?** A: Store Doripenem as directed by your pharmacist.  Usually, this involves refrigeration.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a dose. Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I take Doripenem with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: Is Doripenem safe for children?** A: The safety and efficacy of Doripenem in children have not been established.
* **Q: Can Doripenem cause allergic reactions?** A: Yes, like other antibiotics, Doripenem can cause allergic reactions ranging from mild to severe (anaphylaxis).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction.
