**How it Works:** Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, a type of corticosteroid hormone. It works by:

* **Reducing inflammation:**  It binds to receptors inside cells, affecting gene expression and reducing the production of inflammatory substances.
* **Suppressing the immune system:**  It lowers the activity of the immune system, reducing its response to various stimuli.
* **Stabilizing cell membranes:**  It helps stabilize lysosomal membranes, reducing the release of inflammatory enzymes.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Dexamethasone addictive?**  Dexamethasone is not considered addictive in the same way as opioids, but abrupt discontinuation after prolonged use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions regarding tapering the dose.
* **Can I take Dexamethasone with other medications?**  Many drug interactions are possible.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **How long can I take Dexamethasone?**  The duration of treatment varies significantly depending on the condition being treated.  Short-term use is generally preferred to minimize side effects.  Long-term use requires careful monitoring by a doctor.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Dexamethasone?**  Alcohol can interact with Dexamethasone and increase the risk of side effects, particularly stomach upset and increased blood sugar.  Consult your doctor.
* **Is Dexamethasone safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The use of Dexamethasone during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully considered by a doctor, as it can potentially harm the fetus or infant. The benefits of treatment must outweigh the potential risks.
