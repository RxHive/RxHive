# D-Panthenol

**Generic Name:** D-Panthenol (also known as provitamin B5)

**Usage:** D-Panthenol is used topically to treat a variety of skin conditions and is also sometimes ingested as a supplement.  Topical uses include:

* **Minor burns and sunburns:** Soothes and promotes healing.
* **Diaper rash:** Reduces inflammation and irritation.
* **Skin irritations:** Alleviates dryness, itching, and redness from various causes (e.g., eczema, psoriasis).
* **Wound healing:** Aids in tissue repair and regeneration.
* **Hair and scalp conditions:** Improves hair health and reduces dryness, potentially helping with dandruff.

Oral ingestion is less common and is typically used as a dietary supplement to address potential B5 deficiencies, although evidence for this is limited.  Consult a doctor before using orally.


**Side Effects:** D-Panthenol is generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience:

* **Topical application:** Mild, temporary burning or stinging sensation upon application.  Rarely, allergic reactions such as redness, itching, or rash may occur.
* **Oral ingestion:**  While rare, large doses may cause diarrhea.  It is generally considered safe, but consult a doctor for concerns.


**How it Works:** D-Panthenol is a provitamin, meaning it's converted into pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) in the body. Pantothenic acid is crucial for the production of coenzyme A (CoA), which is involved in numerous metabolic processes.  Topically, it:

* **Hydrates the skin:** Attracts and retains moisture.
* **Reduces inflammation:**  Helps to calm irritated skin.
* **Promotes cell regeneration:** Speeds up the healing process of damaged skin.
