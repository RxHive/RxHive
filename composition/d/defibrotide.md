# Defibrotide
### Generic Name
Defibrotide

### Usage
Defibrotide is a medication used to treat hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS), also known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD), in patients who have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  It's specifically indicated for HSOS cases accompanied by renal or pulmonary dysfunction.  The drug works by improving blood flow in the liver's sinusoids, which are small blood vessels.  While its primary use is in HSOS after HSCT, it's important to note that  its application is limited to this specific and serious post-transplant complication.  There are no other established uses.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dose is calculated based on the patient's baseline body weight (weight before the HSCT preparative regimen).  Hemodynamic stability (meaning their blood pressure and heart rate are stable, ideally requiring no more than one vasopressor medication) and the absence of significant bleeding are crucial before administration. The standard intravenous (IV) dose is 6.25 mg/kg every 6 hours for a minimum of 21 days and up to a maximum of 60 days. Treatment continues until HSOS resolves or the patient is discharged from the hospital.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The dosage for infants, children, and adolescents is the same as the adult dose, calculated using baseline body weight and with the same pre-administration requirements for hemodynamic stability and absence of significant bleeding.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Defibrotide isn't removed by hemodialysis.  However, careful monitoring is critical in patients with these conditions. If severe or life-threatening bleeding occurs, Defibrotide should be withheld.  Treatment might be restarted at the same dose once bleeding resolves and hemodynamic stability is achieved.  If significant bleeding recurs, Defibrotide should be permanently discontinued.  Similarly, hypersensitivity reactions should lead to permanent discontinuation.  Before invasive procedures, Defibrotide should be stopped at least 2 hours beforehand and can be resumed after the procedure, only once the risk of bleeding related to the procedure is eliminated.

**Important:** Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Defibrotide works by several mechanisms to improve blood flow and reduce clotting in the liver's sinusoids. It enhances the activity of plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down blood clots (fibrin). It also modifies the function of endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels), reducing their activation and promoting fibrinolysis (the breakdown of blood clots).  This is achieved by increasing the production of tissue plasminogen activator and thrombomodulin while decreasing the production of von Willebrand factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Defibrotide is derived from porcine (pig) tissue.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Defibrotide or any of its components, and concomitant use with systemic anticoagulants or fibrinolytic agents (except those used to maintain or clear central lines).  
*   **Increased Risk:** Defibrotide increases the risk of hemorrhage (bleeding) and hypersensitivity reactions. Close monitoring is essential.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Defibrotide can enhance the antiplatelet effects of other antiplatelet medications, increasing the risk of bleeding.  Concurrent use of systemic anticoagulants or fibrinolytics is contraindicated. These should be stopped before Defibrotide is started.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Defibrotide's safety during pregnancy is unknown.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Defibrotide.
*   **Specific Populations:** Careful monitoring is necessary for patients with impaired hepatic or renal function.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Defibrotide administered?** A: Defibrotide is administered intravenously (IV) over 2 hours using a 0.2-micron in-line filter.  The IV line should be flushed with D5W or normal saline before and after administration.  It should not be administered with other medications.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately to determine the best course of action. Do not double the dose.

*   **Q: How should Defibrotide be stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.

*   **Q:  Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Defibrotide?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy and balanced diet is always recommended.

*   **Q: Is there a reversal agent for Defibrotide?** A:  No, there is no known reversal agent for Defibrotide.  This highlights the importance of careful monitoring for bleeding.
