# Diethylcarbamazine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate
### Generic Name
Diethylcarbamazine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms associated with filariasis, a parasitic infection spread by mosquitoes.  Diethylcarbamazine is the active ingredient targeting the filarial worms, while chlorpheniramine maleate helps alleviate allergic reactions often accompanying the infection or the diethylcarbamazine treatment itself.  These allergic reactions can manifest as itching, rash, fever, and swelling.  The combination medication aims to tackle both the parasitic infection and its associated symptoms concurrently.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the symptoms *and* the parasitic infection, but it's not a cure for all types of filariasis; the specific type of filariasis must be confirmed by a physician before treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup).  It is **absolutely crucial** to follow the instructions provided by a physician or pharmacist.  Self-medicating with this combination drug can be dangerous.  There is no standard universal dosage that can be provided here. A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs.


**Important Note:**  There is no generally accepted pediatric IV dosage for this combination.  Intravenous administration is typically not used for this specific combination medication.  Oral administration (tablets or syrup) is the most common route.


### Side Effects

Common Side Effects:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Weakness
* Fatigue
* Stomach upset
* Loss of appetite
* Rash or itching


Less Common but Serious Side Effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and sudden onset of hives.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* Seizures
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain)
* Changes in blood counts
* Neurologic symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, discontinue use and contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Diethylcarbamazine acts by killing or incapacitating the filarial worms that cause filariasis. It interferes with their metabolic processes, leading to their eventual death. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens. This reduces the allergic symptoms associated with the parasitic infection and the drug's effects on the worms.  The combined effect provides both treatment for the parasitic infection and relief from its allergic manifestations.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with a known allergy to diethylcarbamazine, chlorpheniramine maleate, or any other component of the medication should avoid using it.
* **Liver Disease:**  Patients with liver problems should exercise caution and only use this medication under strict medical supervision.  Liver function tests may be needed before and during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor.  The potential benefits must be weighed against any potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as interactions are possible.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Drowsiness and dizziness are possible side effects. Avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication, as it may exacerbate side effects.
