# Docusates
### Generic Name
Docusates

### Usage
Docusates are stool softeners primarily used to relieve occasional constipation and prevent hard stools.  They work by allowing more water and fat into the stool, making it softer and easier to pass.  This is particularly helpful for individuals who experience infrequent bowel movements or have difficulty passing stools due to conditions like dehydration or certain medications. While not a treatment for chronic constipation, docusates can provide relief from occasional constipation symptoms and help maintain regular bowel habits.  They are sometimes used to facilitate bowel movements before medical procedures such as colonoscopies but should not be used regularly for this purpose.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Constipation):**

* **Oral:** 50-500 mg once daily (often at bedtime) or divided into doses every 6 hours.
* **Rectal:** 50-100 mg of docusate liquid, administered as a retention or flushing enema.  This form is less common.
* Docusates may sometimes be combined with other laxatives, such as casanthranol, under a doctor's supervision.

**Pediatric Dosage (Constipation):**  Dosage should always be determined by a doctor and is based on the child's age and weight.

* **Oral:**
    * Under 3 years: 10-40 mg/day, or divided into doses every 6 hours.
    * 3-6 years: 20-60 mg/day, or divided into doses every 6 hours.
    * 6-12 years: 40-150 mg/day, or divided into doses every 6 hours.
    * Over 12 years: 50-500 mg/day (often at bedtime) or divided into doses every 6 hours; or 50-100 mg of docusate liquid rectally as a retention or flushing enema.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically necessary for individuals with renal (kidney) or hepatic (liver) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent but can include:

* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramping
* Throat irritation (if taken orally without adequate fluid)

Less common, but more serious side effects,  may include:

* Intestinal obstruction (rare but serious)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage â€“ extremely rare)

**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works
Docusates are surfactant laxatives.  They work by lowering the surface tension of the stool, allowing more water and fat to be absorbed into the stool mass. This increases stool bulk and softens it, making it easier to pass.  They don't stimulate bowel contractions like stimulant laxatives.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Docusates should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to docusates or any of its components, those with intestinal obstruction, acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or who are concurrently using mineral oil.
* **Interactions:** Docusates can potentially increase the absorption of other medications, potentially increasing their effectiveness or toxicity.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Concomitant use with aspirin may increase gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Warnings:**  Prolonged, frequent, or excessive use of docusates can lead to dependence and electrolyte imbalance.  Use only as directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  While generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, it's essential to consult with your doctor before using docusates if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Excretion into breast milk is unknown.

* **Q: Can I take docusates every day?** A: No, docusates are not intended for daily use.  Chronic use can lead to dependence and electrolyte imbalances.  They should only be used as needed for occasional constipation.
