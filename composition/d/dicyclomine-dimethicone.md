# Dicyclomine + Dimethicone
### Generic Name
Dicyclomine + Dimethicone

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional bowel disorders.  Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic, meaning it reduces muscle spasms in the intestines. This helps alleviate cramping pain and discomfort often experienced with IBS. Dimethicone is an antiflatulent, working to reduce gas and bloating, common symptoms accompanying IBS.  While the primary use targets IBS symptoms, it may sometimes be used off-label to manage other conditions causing similar gastrointestinal distress, but this should always be under a doctor's supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet strength, liquid suspension) and the individual's age and health condition.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.  There isn't a standardized pediatric dosing regimen for this combination; pediatric use should be determined and closely monitored by a healthcare professional.  Adult dosages are generally determined by the physician based on the severity of symptoms. Oral formulations are the most common, and dosages will be specified on the prescription.  There is no IV formulation of this combination drug.

### How it Works

Dicyclomine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates smooth muscle contractions in the digestive tract.  By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, dicyclomine relaxes intestinal muscles, thereby lessening spasms and cramping. Dimethicone acts as a defoaming agent, breaking up gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating their easier passage and reducing bloating.  The combination of these two active ingredients provides a synergistic effect, addressing both the spasms and the gas associated with IBS and similar conditions.
