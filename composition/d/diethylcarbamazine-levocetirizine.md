# Diethylcarbamazine + Levocetirizine
### Generic Name
Diethylcarbamazine + Levocetirizine


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms associated with lymphatic filariasis (commonly known as elephantiasis) and allergic reactions that may accompany it.  Diethylcarbamazine is an antifilarial drug, meaning it targets and kills the filarial worms (e.g., *Wuchereria bancrofti*, *Brugia malayi*) responsible for this parasitic infection.  Levocetirizine is an antihistamine that helps relieve allergic symptoms like itching, rash, swelling, and hives which are frequently experienced, particularly during the treatment of filariasis, due to the body's reaction to dying worms.  While this combination is primarily used for filariasis, it might be prescribed off-label in certain situations where both antifilarial and antihistamine effects are deemed beneficial, but this should only be done under the direction of a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary depending on factors like age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  There is no standard, universally accepted dosage for this specific combination, as it's not a pre-formulated drug. Rather,  diethylcarbamazine and levocetirizine are often prescribed individually, then combined.  Therefore, dosage instructions will be provided separately for each component by the prescribing doctor. A doctor will consider the patient's specific needs and carefully adjust the dose.

**Illustrative Example (Not a Prescription):** A typical adult dosage of diethylcarbamazine might range from 6mg/kg per day (divided into several doses), while a common adult levocetirizine dosage is 5mg once daily.  *However, this is a simplified example, and actual dosages can differ significantly.*  Children's doses will be significantly lower and calculated based on weight and age, again under strict medical supervision.  The medication can be administered orally (tablets or syrup, if available).  Intravenous (IV) administration is typically not used for either component.


### Side Effects

* Nausea

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Diethylcarbamazine works by paralyzing and killing filarial worms in the body. This reduces the worm burden and helps alleviate the symptoms of lymphatic filariasis. Levocetirizine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, levocetirizine reduces the intensity of allergic symptoms, such as itching, rash, and swelling.  The combination tackles both the parasitic infection and its associated allergic response.
