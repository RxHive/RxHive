# Dacomitinib
### Generic Name
Dacomitinib

### Usage
Dacomitinib is a targeted therapy primarily used as a first-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's indicated for patients whose tumors have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutation.  These mutations are detectable through FDA-approved tests, and their presence is crucial for determining if dacomitinib is the appropriate treatment.  This medication works by inhibiting the activity of the EGFR, a protein that promotes cancer cell growth.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The standard oral dose is 45 mg once daily. This continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects arise.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of side effects (see Dosage Adjustments below).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of dacomitinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 30-89 mL/min.  For CrCl < 30 mL/min, the manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage instructions.
* **Toxicity Management:**  Dose reduction is recommended for various side effects.  For instance, if a patient experiences grade 2 diarrhea, treatment might be temporarily interrupted until the side effect improves to grade â‰¤1.  The treatment can then be resumed at the same dose, or a reduced dose if the diarrhea recurs.  Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or any grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction requires temporary interruption until improvement to a lower grade, followed by resumption at a reduced dose.  Grade 3 or 4 dermatologic toxicity also necessitates temporary interruption with subsequent dose reduction.  Interstitial lung disease (ILD) at any grade requires permanent discontinuation of dacomitinib.  Specific dose reduction steps are: Initial/usual dose: 45 mg OD; First dose reduction: 30 mg OD; Second dose reduction: 15 mg OD.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dacomitinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by irreversibly binding to and blocking the activity of EGFR.  EGFR is a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth and division of cells.  In some lung cancers with specific EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitutions), EGFR is overactive, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.  By inhibiting EGFR, dacomitinib helps to slow or stop the growth of these cancer cells.  Dacomitinib also has activity against other kinases, such as DDR1, EPHA6, LCK, DDR2, and MNK1.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dacomitinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) may reduce dacomitinib's effectiveness. Using dacomitinib with certain drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase their blood levels and risks.
* **Warnings:** Dacomitinib can cause severe diarrhea, interstitial lung disease, and serious skin reactions.  It's also known to cause fetal harm, and women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for at least 17 days after treatment.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during and for at least 17 days after treatment. Monitor for signs of these serious side effects.
* **Specific Populations:**  Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.  Use caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dacomitinib with food?** A: Dacomitinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Take the next dose as scheduled.

* **Q: How should I store dacomitinib?** A: Store dacomitinib as directed on the label, usually at room temperature.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Serious side effects include severe diarrhea, skin reactions (rash, peeling skin), shortness of breath, and symptoms suggestive of interstitial lung disease.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking dacomitinib?** A: Dacomitinib may cause drowsiness or dizziness;  avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
