# Dacomitinib

**Generic Name:** Dacomitinib

**Usage:** Dacomitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, it's indicated for:

* Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) mutations.  This is usually used after prior treatment failure with a EGFR TKI (such as gefitinib or erlotinib).
*  It may also be used as a first-line treatment for certain patients in combination with other therapies.  Exact usage guidelines depend on individual patient factors and current treatment recommendations.  Consult a medical professional for precise treatment plans.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, dacomitinib can cause side effects. Some common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is a very frequent side effect and can be severe.  Management often involves medication to control diarrhea.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These can be managed with antiemetic medications.
* **Dry skin and rash:** Moisturizers may be helpful.
* **Fatigue:** This is common with many cancer treatments.
* **Stomach pain:**  This can be managed with medication.
* **Nail changes:**  Nails may thicken or become discolored.
* **Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs):** This is a serious side effect that requires immediate medical attention.
* **Interstitial lung disease:** Another serious lung condition.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Especially low potassium and magnesium.
* **Heart problems (rare but serious):**  Such as QT prolongation.


This is not an exhaustive list.  More serious and less common side effects can also occur.  It is crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Dacomitinib works by blocking the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase.  EGFR is a protein that plays a role in the growth and division of cancer cells. By inhibiting EGFR, dacomitinib helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells that depend on EGFR signaling for survival.  Specifically, it targets the EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R mutations) mentioned above, which makes it more effective against those specific types of NSCLC than other EGFR TKIs.


**FAQs:**

* **Is dacomitinib a chemotherapy drug?** No, it's a targeted therapy, a type of cancer treatment that targets specific molecules involved in cancer growth.  While it's used in cancer treatment, it's mechanistically different from chemotherapy.
* **How is dacomitinib administered?** It's taken orally (by mouth) as a tablet.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Are there any specific dietary restrictions?**  Your doctor may provide dietary recommendations depending on the side effects you experience.  Managing diarrhea is often a key element in dietary considerations.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking dacomitinib?**  Itâ€™s generally recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking dacomitinib due to potential interactions and the risk of increased side effects.  Consult your doctor for specific advice.
* **What are the long-term effects of dacomitinib?** Long-term effects vary, some side effects may persist after treatment ends, while others may resolve. Regular monitoring is important to manage any long-term effects.
