# Docusate
### Generic Name
Docusate

### Usage
Docusate is primarily used as a stool softener to prevent straining during bowel movements and to treat constipation.  It works by making the stool softer and easier to pass.  A less common use is as a ceruminolytic agent, meaning it helps soften and remove earwax.  In this case, it's usually administered directly into the ear canal.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Oral (as a stool softener):** Docusate calcium: 240 mg once daily; Docusate sodium: 50-360 mg once daily or in divided doses.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual needs and response.
* **Rectal (as a stool softener):** Enema (containing 283 mg/5 mL):  One enema 1-3 times daily.
* **Otic (for earwax removal):**  Solution (0.5%): Apply enough drops to fill the affected ear once nightly for up to two consecutive nights.  Oral liquid (Docusate sodium): 1 mL in a 2 mL syringe administered into the affected ear.  If earwax isn't cleared within 15 minutes, irrigate with 50-100 mL of lukewarm normal saline.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children varies significantly depending on age and weight and whether it's used for constipation or earwax removal.  Always follow the prescribing doctor's instructions.  Weight-based dosing is often preferred for infants and young children.

* **Oral (for constipation):** Docusate sodium:  The dosage varies from 5 mg/kg/day for infants and young children, divided into several doses, to up to 150 mg/day in divided doses for older children.  For adolescents, the dose can be higher, sometimes reaching 500mg/day in divided doses.
* **Rectal (for constipation):**  Enema dosage also depends on the child's age, ranging from 100 mg once daily to 283 mg once or multiple times daily.
* **Otic (for earwax removal):**  Solution (0.5%): Apply sufficient drops to fill the affected ear once nightly for up to two consecutive nights.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Throat pain (with oral liquid formulations), diarrhea, rash.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Although rare, some individuals may experience more serious adverse reactions.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider if any unexpected or concerning side effects occur.


### How it Works
Docusate is a surfactant.  This means it lowers the surface tension of the stool.  By reducing surface tension, it allows water and fats to penetrate the stool, making it softer and easier to eliminate.  This effect facilitates easier bowel movements and reduces straining.  The mechanism is similar for both oral and rectal administration. In the ear, it softens earwax to aid in its removal.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Docusate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to docusate or any of its components, those experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or intestinal obstruction, or patients with a perforated eardrum or ear inflammation (for otic use).
* **Use with Caution:**  Newborns may need special caution with some formulations containing propylene glycol.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels) has been reported in newborns whose mothers used high doses of docusate sodium during pregnancy. The excretion of docusate in breast milk is unknown; alternatives may be preferred during breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:** Although rare, interactions with other medications are possible.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
