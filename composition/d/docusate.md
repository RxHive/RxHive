# Docusate

**Generic Name:** Docusate Sodium (also known as Dioctyl Sodium Sulfosuccinate)


**Usage:**

Docusate sodium is a stool softener used to treat constipation.  It's often used for:

* **Relief of occasional constipation:** This includes situations where bowel movements are infrequent, hard, or difficult to pass.
* **Prevention of constipation:**  Especially helpful for individuals prone to constipation, such as those recovering from surgery or those who have medical conditions that cause constipation.
* **Easier bowel movements:**  Docusate sodium makes stools softer and easier to pass, reducing straining.
* **Preparation for medical procedures:**  Sometimes used to soften stool before procedures such as colonoscopies or rectal examinations.


**Side Effects:**

Docusate sodium is generally considered safe when used as directed.  However, some possible side effects include:

* **Mild cramping or diarrhea:** These are usually mild and temporary.
* **Nausea:** Though infrequent.
* **Stomach upset:**  A less common side effect.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions like rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.


**How it Works:**

Docusate sodium works by increasing the amount of water absorbed into the stool. This makes the stool softer and bulkier, making it easier to pass through the intestines. It does this by lowering the surface tension of the stool, allowing it to mix better with water.  It does *not* stimulate the bowel like a laxative; instead, it works to physically change the consistency of the stool.
