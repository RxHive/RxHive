# Diclofenac + Rabeprazole
### Generic Name
Diclofenac + Rabeprazole

### Usage

Diclofenac + Rabeprazole is a combination medication used primarily to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other musculoskeletal conditions.  Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is the primary pain reliever and anti-inflammatory agent. Rabeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is included to protect the stomach lining from the potential ulcer-causing effects of diclofenac.  NSAIDs like diclofenac can irritate the stomach and increase the risk of ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.  The rabeprazole component helps mitigate this risk. While primarily used for musculoskeletal pain, this combination may sometimes be considered for other inflammatory conditions under strict medical supervision, but this is not a typical application.


### Dosage

Dosage of Diclofenac + Rabeprazole varies depending on the specific formulation (tablet strength), the patient's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor.  There's no standard pediatric dosage for this combination; it's generally not recommended for children.  

* **Adults (Oral):**  The typical adult dosage involves taking one tablet once or twice daily, as prescribed by a physician.  The exact dose and frequency will be tailored to individual needs.  Do not exceed the prescribed dosage.

* **Children (Oral):**  This combination is typically not prescribed for children. Diclofenac and rabeprazole are often available in individual formulations suitable for children, but only under strict medical supervision and with carefully adjusted dosages based on the child's weight and age.

* **IV Administration:** This combination medication is not available in an intravenous (IV) form. Diclofenac and rabeprazole are given intravenously separately if needed, but never as a pre-mixed combination.  IV administration is only done in a hospital setting by trained medical professionals.

### How it Works

Diclofenac inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.  By reducing prostaglandin levels, diclofenac helps alleviate pain and reduce swelling.  Rabeprazole reduces stomach acid production by blocking the proton pump in the stomach cells. This protective effect minimizes the risk of stomach ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems commonly associated with NSAID use.


### Precautions

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication and require lower doses.  Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function is recommended.
* **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking this medication as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
