# Diclofenac + Rabeprazole

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Rabeprazole

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation (swelling) associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It's particularly useful for patients who also have or are at risk of developing gastrointestinal problems (e.g., ulcers) associated with NSAID use, like Diclofenac.  Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The Rabeprazole helps protect the stomach lining from the potentially damaging effects of Diclofenac.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, gas.  Less common but more serious: peptic ulcer disease, bleeding, perforation (hole) in the stomach or intestines.
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, fluid retention.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching.
* **Liver:** Elevated liver enzymes (indicated by blood tests).
* **Kidney:**  Decreased kidney function.

This is not an exhaustive list, and serious side effects are possible. Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or severe symptoms.

**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:** Works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.  It belongs to a class of drugs called NSAIDs.
* **Rabeprazole:** Reduces stomach acid production by blocking the proton pump in the stomach lining's cells. This protective effect minimizes the risk of ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems often associated with NSAIDs like Diclofenac.  The combination provides pain relief while mitigating the potential for stomach damage.
