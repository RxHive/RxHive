# Diloxanide

**Generic Name:** Diloxanide furoate

**Usage:** Diloxanide furoate is an amebicide used to treat intestinal amebiasis caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  It's specifically effective against the luminal (intestinal) stage of the infection.  It's often used in conjunction with other medications, like metronidazole, to treat both the intestinal and extra-intestinal (e.g., liver) forms of amebiasis.  It's generally not used alone to treat invasive amebiasis.

**Side Effects:** Diloxanide furoate is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and flatulence are the most common side effects.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rarely, allergic reactions such as skin rash, itching, or hives can occur.
* **Other rare side effects:**  Headache, dizziness, and changes in taste perception have been reported.

**How it Works:** Diloxanide furoate is a luminal amebicide.  This means it works by killing *Entamoeba histolytica* parasites residing in the intestines.  The exact mechanism isn't completely understood, but it's thought to interfere with the parasite's energy production and metabolism, ultimately leading to its death.  It doesn't effectively penetrate tissues outside the intestines, which is why it's often used in combination with other drugs for more extensive infections.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking diloxanide furoate?** A: There's no specific interaction with alcohol, but it's generally advisable to avoid alcohol while taking any medication unless otherwise advised by your doctor. Alcohol can sometimes worsen gastrointestinal side effects.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The duration of treatment is typically 10 days.  Symptoms may improve within a few days, but the full course of medication is necessary to eliminate the parasites.

* **Q: Is diloxanide furoate safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  The safety of diloxanide furoate during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  It should only be used during these periods if the potential benefits outweigh the risks, under strict medical supervision.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Is diloxanide furoate available over-the-counter?** A: No, diloxanide furoate is a prescription medication. It requires a doctor's diagnosis and prescription.  Self-treating amebiasis can be dangerous.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.
