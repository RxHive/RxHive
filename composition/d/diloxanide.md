# Diloxanide
### Generic Name
Diloxanide Furoate

### Usage

Diloxanide furoate is a medication primarily used to treat intestinal infections caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*, a parasite that can lead to amebiasis.  It's specifically effective against the cyst stage of the parasite, preventing its spread and further infection.  Diloxanide furoate targets the parasite within the intestinal lumen (the inside of the intestine), meaning it primarily works on the infection within the gut itself.  It is not effective against invasive amebiasis (where the parasite has spread beyond the intestines) and is typically used in conjunction with other drugs for treating such infections.  Its main role is to eradicate the remaining cysts to prevent recurrence of the infection.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual adult dose for asymptomatic intestinal amebiasis is 500 mg three times a day (TID) for ten days. A second course might be considered if necessary, based on the doctor's assessment.

**Children:** For children weighing over 25 kg (approximately 55 lbs) and adolescents, the dosage is 20 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses, for ten days. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 1500 mg.  Dosage for children weighing less than 25 kg should be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Important Note:**  The information above is for guidance only.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual's age, weight, overall health, and the severity of the infection.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Abdominal cramps
*   Diarrhea
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Skin rash (erythema, pruritus, urticaria)
*   Flatulence (gas)
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and swelling.  If you experience any serious or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Diloxanide furoate is a luminal amebicide. This means it works directly within the intestinal lumen (the space inside the intestines) to destroy the trophozoites (active forms) of *Entamoeba histolytica*.  By eliminating these trophozoites, it prevents the formation of cysts, which are the infectious stage of the parasite. This action helps clear the infection and prevents its spread.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Diloxanide furoate should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergies to the medication or its components.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of diloxanide furoate during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking this medication.

* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with liver or kidney impairment.  A doctor should be consulted to determine the appropriate dosage.

* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements you are taking, as they may interact with diloxanide furoate.
