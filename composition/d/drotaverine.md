# Drotaverine
### Generic Name
Drotaverine

### Usage
Drotaverine is primarily used as an antispasmodic medication.  Its main application is in treating functional bowel disorders, where it helps relieve the painful spasms associated with conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It's also effective in reducing pain associated with renal colic (kidney stones).  While not its primary use, it may find application in other conditions involving smooth muscle spasms, though this should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the patient's age and the condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.

**Adults (Functional bowel disorders and renal colic pain):** The usual oral dose is 40-80 mg twice or three times daily.

**Children:** Drotaverine is contraindicated in children under 1 year of age.

* **Ages 1-5 years:**  The oral dose is typically 20 mg three or four times a day.
* **Ages 6-12 years:** The oral dose is generally 40 mg three times daily. The maximum single dose should not exceed 80 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No specific dose adjustment is recommended by manufacturers for mild to moderate hepatic impairment; however, caution is advised. Drotaverine is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Similar to hepatic impairment, no specific dose adjustment is usually recommended for mild to moderate renal impairment, but use should be cautious.  It's contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.

The medication is usually taken orally.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding the specific form of the medication (tablet, capsule, etc.) and the frequency of administration.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, while not experienced by everyone, can include:

* Heat sensation
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Allergic dermatitis (skin rash)
* Fainting
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth

Less common but potentially serious side effects may occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Drotaverine works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). By inhibiting this enzyme, Drotaverine increases cAMP levels within smooth muscle cells. This increase in cAMP leads to a reduction in calcium uptake and altered calcium distribution within the cells. The net effect is relaxation of smooth muscle, thus relieving spasms and associated pain.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Drotaverine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to drotaverine or any component of the formulation.
* Severe cardiac disease.
* Porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme synthesis).
* Glaucoma.
* Severe liver disease.
* Severe kidney disease.
* Children under 1 year of age.

**Precautions and Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate cardiac disease.

**Drug Interactions:** Drotaverine may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa; therefore, concurrent use should be avoided or carefully monitored.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Caution is advised during pregnancy.  The excretion of Drotaverine in breast milk is unknown; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.

### FAQs
**Q: Can I take Drotaverine with food?**

A:  Drotaverine may be taken with or without food.

**Q: How should I store Drotaverine?**

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q:  Can I drive or operate machinery after taking Drotaverine?**

A:  Because dizziness and fainting are potential side effects, it's best to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.

**Q: When should I contact my doctor?**

A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects, or if your symptoms worsen.  This is especially important for any heart-related symptoms.
