# Doxapram
### Generic Name
Doxapram

### Usage
Doxapram is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, specifically an analeptic, primarily used to treat respiratory depression.  Its main application is in cases of respiratory depression following anesthesia.  It's also indicated for mild to moderate drug-induced respiratory and CNS depression, and for acute hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels) secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's important to note that Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant and not a cure for the underlying condition causing respiratory distress.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the indication and method of administration (IV intermittent injection or infusion).  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.

* **Respiratory Depression Following Anesthesia:**
    * **IV Intermittent Injection:** Initial dose: 0.5-1 mg/kg; repeat at 5-minute intervals if needed. Maximum single dose: 1.5 mg/kg; maximum total dose: 2 mg/kg.
    * **IV Infusion:** Initial dose: 5 mg/min until response or adverse effects; then reduce to 1-3 mg/min. Maximum total dose: 4 mg/kg.

* **Drug-Induced CNS Depression:**
    * **IV Intermittent Injection:** Initial dose: 1-2 mg/kg; repeat after 5 minutes if needed; repeat at 1-2 hour intervals until sustained consciousness. Maximum daily dose: 3000 mg.
    * **IV Infusion:** Initial dose: 1-2 mg/kg, repeat after 5 minutes if needed.  If a response is noted, initiate infusion at 1-3 mg/min, suspending if the patient awakens.  Infusion should not exceed 2 hours.  Re-initiate after a 30-minute to 2-hour rest, including a bolus dose. Maximum daily dose: 3000 mg.

* **Acute Hypercapnia Secondary to COPD:**
    * **IV Infusion:**  Begin at 1-2 mg/min, adjusting to a maximum of 3 mg/min. Infusion should not exceed 2 hours. Additional infusions are not recommended.


**Pediatric Dosage (â‰¥12 years):**  Dosage is similar to adults, but always under strict medical supervision.  Specific pediatric dosing should be determined by a physician based on the child's weight and condition.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nervous system: Apprehension, clonus, disorientation, dizziness, hallucinations, headache, hyperactivity, hyperreflexia, involuntary muscle movements, paresthesia, seizures.
* Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmias, changes in pulse, chest pain, chest tightness, ECG changes, flushing, increased blood pressure, phlebitis, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia.
* Respiratory: Bronchospasm, cough, dyspnea, hyperventilation, hypoventilation (rebound), tachypnea.
* Gastrointestinal: Bowel urgency, diarrhea, hiccups, nausea, vomiting.
* Dermatologic: Burning sensation, diaphoresis (sweating), pruritus (itching).
* Other possible side effects:  Fever, increased BUN levels, decreased hematocrit/hemoglobin/RBC count, hemolysis, albuminuria, mydriasis, urinary incontinence/retention, muscle spasms, fasciculations, laryngospasm.


Less common but serious side effects such as QT prolongation and atrioventricular block have been reported, particularly in premature neonates.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works
Doxapram primarily stimulates respiration by acting on the peripheral carotid chemoreceptors, which detect changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. This stimulates the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata of the brain, leading to increased respiratory rate and depth. At higher doses, it may also directly stimulate the respiratory center.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Doxapram is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, cerebral edema, cerebrovascular accident, epilepsy or other seizure disorders, head injury, significant cardiovascular impairment, severe hypertension, and certain respiratory conditions like mechanical ventilation problems or pulmonary embolism.
* **Interactions:** Doxapram may interact with other drugs, potentially increasing or decreasing their effects.  Discuss all medications with your doctor or pharmacist before using Doxapram.  Specific interactions are possible with MAO inhibitors, sympathomimetics, and other CNS stimulants.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with hypermetabolic states (e.g., hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma), hepatic or renal impairment, premature neonates, infants, and those with cerebrovascular disease.  Avoid rapid infusion and extravasation. Adequate airway is necessary before administration. Resuscitative equipment should be readily available.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Doxapram administered?** A: Doxapram is administered intravenously, either as an intermittent bolus or continuous infusion.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the dose and route of administration.

* **Q: Can I take Doxapram with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking before starting Doxapram. Interactions are possible.

* **Q: How should Doxapram be stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Doxapram is usually administered in a hospital setting under direct medical supervision; therefore, missed doses aren't typically a concern for the patient to manage.  Consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions.

* **Q: Is Doxapram safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  The safety of Doxapram during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, planning pregnancy, or breastfeeding.
