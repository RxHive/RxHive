# Doxercalciferol
### Generic Name
Doxercalciferol

### Usage

Doxercalciferol is a synthetic vitamin D2 analog primarily used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism.  This condition occurs when the parathyroid glands produce excessive parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to low blood calcium levels, often seen in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  It's used in two main patient populations:

* **CKD patients on dialysis:** Doxercalciferol helps control elevated PTH levels in individuals with advanced CKD who are undergoing dialysis treatment.  The goal is to manage PTH levels without causing dangerously high calcium levels.

* **CKD patients *not* on dialysis (stages 3 or 4):**  While less common, Doxercalciferol may be used in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (stages 3 or 4) who aren't yet on dialysis but have problematic secondary hyperparathyroidism.  Use in this population should be carefully considered and guided by the latest Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.  These guidelines generally emphasize a more conservative approach to using vitamin D analogs in non-dialysis CKD patients, reserving their use for cases with severe, progressive hyperparathyroidism.


### Dosage

Dosage of Doxercalciferol varies significantly depending on whether the patient is on dialysis and their overall health.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be interpreted as a replacement for medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **CKD patients on dialysis (Oral):**  The initial dose is typically 10 mcg three times per week during dialysis sessions (never more often than every other day).  The dose is adjusted (usually in 2.5 mcg increments every 8 weeks) to achieve the target PTH level, with a maximum dose of 20 mcg three times a week.

* **CKD patients on dialysis (Intravenous):** The initial dose is usually 4 mcg as a bolus injection three times a week at the end of dialysis sessions (no more often than every other day).  The dose is titrated (typically 1-2 mcg increments every 8 weeks) to reach the target PTH level, up to a maximum of 18 mcg weekly.

* **CKD patients *not* on dialysis (Oral):**  The starting dose is typically 1 mcg daily.  The dose is carefully increased (in 0.5 mcg increments every 2 weeks), as needed, to reach the target PTH level, not exceeding a maximum of 3.5 mcg daily.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Doxercalciferol in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage may need to be adjusted based on blood calcium and phosphorus levels, as well as PTH levels.  These parameters are carefully monitored, and the dose may be reduced or temporarily stopped if hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia occurs.  Dose adjustments are also considered for hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These occur in more than 10% of patients:

* Headache
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Insomnia
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Dizziness
* Edema (swelling)
* Rhinitis (runny nose)
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anemia
* Infections
* Asthenia (weakness)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium): This is a serious side effect that needs immediate medical attention. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and in severe cases, seizures.
* Hyperphosphatemia (high blood phosphorus): This can contribute to complications and requires monitoring.
* Allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema):  These are rare but potentially life-threatening.

Any new or worsening side effect should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Doxercalciferol is a vitamin D analog.  After being metabolized in the body, it becomes the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2). This active form works to:

* Increase the absorption of calcium from the intestines.
* Increase the reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys.
* Increase the release of calcium from bones (in conjunction with parathyroid hormone).

By increasing calcium levels, doxercalciferol helps reduce the overproduction of PTH by the parathyroid glands, leading to better control of secondary hyperparathyroidism.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Doxercalciferol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), or vitamin D toxicity.

* **Drug Interactions:** Doxercalciferol interacts with several medications, including calcium supplements, phosphate binders, cardiac glycosides, and certain diuretics.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.  Interactions can increase the risk of hypercalcemia or other adverse effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Doxercalciferol is classified as Category C for pregnancy, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  Use during pregnancy should only occur if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. The effects of Doxercalciferol on breastfeeding are also not fully known.  Careful monitoring of the infant is required if breastfeeding continues during treatment.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Doxercalciferol should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease.

* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels is essential to ensure safe and effective treatment and prevent hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Doxercalciferol?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on individual response and the severity of the condition.  It's a long-term medication for many patients with CKD.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance.  Don't try to make up for a missed dose by taking a double dose.

* **Q: Can I take Doxercalciferol with other medications?** A:  It's critical to discuss all medications you're taking with your doctor.  Many drugs can interact negatively with Doxercalciferol, and your doctor needs to know about them to ensure safe and effective treatment.

* **Q: How should I store Doxercalciferol?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist; typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Are there any foods I should avoid while taking Doxercalciferol?** A:  Your doctor may recommend dietary restrictions, especially regarding calcium and phosphorus intake, to optimize the effectiveness and safety of treatment and minimize the risk of hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia.
