# Diclofenac + Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory infections, as well as pain and inflammation.  It combines the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of diclofenac and paracetamol (acetaminophen) with the antihistamine effects of chlorpheniramine maleate.  Specific uses may include:

* **Pain relief:** Headache, muscle aches, toothache, menstrual cramps.
* **Fever reduction:** Associated with infections.
* **Inflammation reduction:**  From conditions like arthritis (though not a primary treatment).
* **Allergy symptom relief:** Runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes (due to chlorpheniramine maleate).


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, ulcers (especially with diclofenac).
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia (chlorpheniramine maleate is a sedating antihistamine).
* **Allergic Reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).
* **Other:** Liver damage (rare but possible with paracetamol overdose), increased bleeding risk (diclofenac), blurred vision.


**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:**  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and provides mild to moderate pain relief through a mechanism not fully understood, but thought to involve inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. This helps relieve symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
