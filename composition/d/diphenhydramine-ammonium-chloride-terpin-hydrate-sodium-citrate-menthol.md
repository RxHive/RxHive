# Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Terpin Hydrate + Sodium Citrate + Menthol

This combination of Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride + Terpin Hydrate + Sodium Citrate + Menthol is a commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medication, though the exact formulation may vary slightly between brands.  It's important to note that **this is not a single drug with a single generic name**, but rather a combination of several active ingredients.  Therefore, a single generic name isn't applicable.


**Generic Name:**  N/A (Combination Product)


**Usage:** This combination is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu, specifically:

* **Cough:**  Terpin hydrate and ammonium chloride act as expectorants, helping to loosen and thin mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up.
* **Runny Nose/Congestion:**  While not a primary function of this combination, the expectorant effect can help with congestion by clearing nasal passages.  This may be further assisted by menthol's cooling effect.
* **Sneezing:** Although not explicitly targeted, the reduction in congestion can alleviate sneezing.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage but may include:

* **Drowsiness:**  Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with strong sedative effects.
* **Dry Mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by the sedative effects of diphenhydramine.
* **Nausea:**  Ammonium chloride can cause nausea in some individuals.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Constipation:**  A possibility, although less frequent.
* **Allergic Reactions:** While rare, allergic reactions are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Diphenhydramine (antihistamine):**  Though not typically used for its antihistamine action in this context,  it contributes primarily to the sedative effects, which can help with nighttime coughs.
* **Ammonium Chloride (expectorant):** Helps to thin and loosen mucus.
* **Terpin Hydrate (expectorant):**  Also helps to thin and loosen mucus, often working synergistically with ammonium chloride.
* **Sodium Citrate (buffer):** Helps to adjust the pH of the medication for better absorption and stability.
* **Menthol (counterirritant):**  Provides a cooling sensation, potentially offering temporary relief from congestion and cough.  The effect is mostly topical.
