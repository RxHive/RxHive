# Diclofenac diethylamine + Methyl Salicylate + Alcohol

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac diethylamine + Methyl salicylate + Alcohol (This combination doesn't have a single, universally accepted generic name.  The name reflects the individual components.)

**Usage:** This topical combination is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with:

* Musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., arthritis, sprains, strains)
* Minor aches and pains
* Bruises

**It's important to note:** This is a topical analgesic and anti-inflammatory; it's not intended for internal use. Its effectiveness is primarily localized to the area of application.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized, but can include:

* Skin irritation: Redness, itching, burning, rash, swelling at the application site.
* Allergic reactions: In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions like hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue can occur.  Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if this happens.
* Sensitivity to light (photosensitivity): Increased sun sensitivity may occur in some individuals.
* Other rare side effects:  These are less common but can include blisters, skin peeling, and discoloration.


**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac diethylamine:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing inflammation and pain at the site of application.  It inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain.

* **Methyl salicylate:** A salicylate derivative with analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory properties.  Similar to aspirin, it works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.  It also possesses counter-irritant properties, meaning it can create a mild irritation that can distract from deeper pain.

* **Alcohol (usually ethanol):** Acts as a solvent and penetration enhancer, helping the other active ingredients absorb into the skin more effectively. It also contributes to a cooling sensation, offering temporary pain relief.
