# Dextrose
### Generic Name
Dextrose

### Usage

Dextrose, a form of glucose, is primarily used to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  This is its most crucial application, especially in emergency situations where rapid blood sugar elevation is needed. It's administered intravenously (IV) or orally depending on the severity and the patient's condition.

Beyond hypoglycemia treatment, dextrose serves several important secondary roles:

* **Fluid replacement:**  Dextrose solutions can be used to replenish fluids lost through dehydration, often combined with electrolytes to restore the body's electrolyte balance.
* **Nutritional support:**  Dextrose is a key component of parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding), providing the body with essential calories when oral intake is impossible or insufficient.
* **Glucose tolerance test:**  It's used as a diagnostic tool in glucose tolerance tests to assess how well the body processes glucose and helps diagnose conditions like diabetes.
* **Adjunctive treatment for hyperkalemia:** Although off-label, dextrose, given intravenously with insulin, may help lower dangerously high potassium levels (hyperkalemia).


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the reason for administration, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the condition.  Always follow a healthcare provider's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Hypoglycemia (IV):** 10-25 grams (40-100 mL of 25% solution or 20-50 mL of 50% solution). Repeat as needed in severe cases.
* **Hypoglycemia (Oral):** 15-20 grams as a single dose. Repeat in 15 minutes if blood sugar remains low.  Follow with a meal or snack.
* **Glucose tolerance test (Oral):**  75 grams (one-step) or 50 grams initially followed by 100 grams (two-step) according to the test protocol.
* **Hyperkalemia (IV, off-label):** 25 grams of dextrose (50 mL of D50W) over 5-30 minutes, administered with 10 units of regular insulin.  Repeat as needed.


**Children:**

Dosage calculations for children are based on weight (mg/kg) and vary considerably based on the child's age and condition.  Specific dosages for hypoglycemia, glucose tolerance tests, and hyperkalemia treatment in children need to be determined by a healthcare professional. Parenteral nutrition dosage is also weight-based and involves different initial and maintenance rates depending on the child's age.  Always follow a physician's precise instructions.


**Important Note:**  The administration route (IV, oral, etc.) and concentration of the dextrose solution are crucial and must be determined by a medical professional. Incorrect administration can have serious consequences.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  (Frequency not specified in all cases)

* Localized phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Venous thrombosis (blood clot in a vein)
* Confusion
* Loss of consciousness

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis â€“ a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Dehydration
* Glycosuria (glucose in the urine)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Hyperosmolar syndrome (high blood sugar and osmolality)
* Hypervolemia (increased blood volume)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Local pain (at injection site)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dextrose, being a simple sugar (glucose), is readily absorbed and metabolized by the body.  It directly raises blood glucose levels, counteracting hypoglycemia. In parenteral nutrition, it serves as a primary source of calories. When administered with insulin in hyperkalemia treatment, it facilitates the movement of potassium into cells, thus reducing serum potassium levels.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Dextrose is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to dextrose or corn products, severe dehydration, clinically significant hyperglycemia, anuria (lack of urine production), hepatic coma, and certain situations involving intracranial or intraspinal hemorrhage.  It should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients with certain conditions, such as those with hepatic or hepatobiliary disorders, diabetes, pulmonary edema, or renal impairment, may have an increased risk of complications.  Very-low-birth-weight infants are also at greater risk.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While not extensively interactive, dextrose's use alongside other medications, especially those affecting blood sugar or electrolytes, should be closely monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  While dextrose itself is generally considered safe, its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully managed under a doctor's supervision.
* **Other Precautions:**  Concentrated dextrose solutions need appropriate dilution for peripheral venous administration.  The rate of IV administration should be closely monitored, particularly in infants and vulnerable populations. Refeeding syndrome is a risk for severely undernourished individuals.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dextrose without a doctor's prescription?** A: Oral dextrose for treating mild hypoglycemia might be available over-the-counter, but intravenous administration always requires a doctor's prescription and medical supervision.
* **Q: How should I store dextrose?** A: Store dextrose according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of dextrose use?** A:  The long-term effects depend on the reason for use and dosage.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is essential, especially for those on long-term parenteral nutrition or frequent dextrose infusions.
* **Q: Is dextrose the same as glucose?** A: Dextrose is a form of glucose, specifically D-glucose.  The terms are often used interchangeably in a medical context.
* **Q: Can I use dextrose to gain weight?** A: Dextrose provides calories, but it's not a recommended way to gain weight. Healthy dietary practices and exercise are preferable.
