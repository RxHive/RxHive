# Dextrose

**Generic Name:** Dextrose (also known as D-glucose or corn sugar)

**Usage:**

* **Intravenous (IV) Infusion:**  Dextrose is commonly used intravenously to provide the body with essential glucose when a person is unable to consume it orally or cannot maintain adequate blood sugar levels. This is often seen in situations like:
    * Severe dehydration
    * Malnutrition
    * Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
    * Post-surgery recovery
    * Certain medical emergencies

* **Additive in Food and Pharmaceuticals:** Dextrose is used as a sweetener and filler in many food products and medications.  It's also used in some intravenous medications as a vehicle (a solution to dissolve the active ingredient in).


**Side Effects:**

Side effects of dextrose, particularly when given intravenously, can include:

* **Phlebitis:** Inflammation of the vein at the IV insertion site.
* **Infiltration:** Leakage of the IV fluid into the surrounding tissue.
* **Thrombophlebitis:** Blood clot formation in the vein.
* **Hyperglycemia:** High blood sugar, especially in individuals with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. This can lead to symptoms such as increased thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, and fatigue.
* **Fluid overload:**  If given too rapidly or in excessive amounts, dextrose can lead to fluid overload, resulting in edema (swelling) and shortness of breath.
* **Infection:** At the IV site.

**How it Works:**

Dextrose is a simple sugar that is readily absorbed into the bloodstream.  Once in the blood, it is used by the body's cells as a primary source of energy.  Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps to move dextrose from the blood into cells where it can be used for metabolic processes.

**FAQs:**

* **Is dextrose the same as glucose?**  Yes, dextrose is another name for D-glucose.
* **Is dextrose safe?** When administered appropriately by healthcare professionals, dextrose is generally safe. However, improper administration can lead to significant side effects.
* **Can I take dextrose orally?** Yes, dextrose is a common sugar found in many foods, and it's safe for oral consumption, unless you have specific health conditions like diabetes.
* **What are the differences between dextrose and sucrose (table sugar)?** Sucrose is a disaccharide (composed of glucose and fructose), while dextrose is a monosaccharide (a single glucose molecule). Dextrose is more readily absorbed.
* **Can I use dextrose to treat hypoglycemia at home?**  No.  For treating hypoglycemia, use medically approved methods.  Always consult a doctor before treating hypoglycemia yourself.  Intravenous dextrose should only be administered by a trained medical professional.
* **Should I be concerned if dextrose is listed as an ingredient in my food or medicine?**  Generally, the amount of dextrose in food or medications is not a cause for concern unless you have specific dietary restrictions or health conditions such as diabetes.  Always check with your doctor if you are unsure.
