# Digoxin
### Generic Name
Digoxin

### Usage
Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside derived from the foxglove plant (Digitalis), primarily controls the ventricular response rate in adults with chronic atrial fibrillation.  It's also used to treat mild-to-moderate heart failure (stage C according to ACCF/AHA guidelines) in adults.  In pediatric patients, digoxin increases myocardial contractility to manage heart failure.  Off-label uses include managing fetal tachycardia (through maternal administration) and controlling the rate in supraventricular tachycardia.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition and route of administration (oral or intravenous).  A physician will carefully determine the appropriate dose based on individual factors.  Generally, a total digitalizing dose (TDD) approach may be used for atrial fibrillation or flutter, followed by a maintenance dose.  For heart failure, a maintenance dose is typically started without a loading dose.  Specific dosing instructions (including loading and maintenance doses) are complex and should only be determined and overseen by a healthcare professional. Note that monitoring Digoxin concentrations is crucial, especially in cases of renal impairment, as toxicity can occur even at therapeutic levels. Switching between oral and IV administration may also require dosage adjustments.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosing is weight-based and differs significantly based on age (premature neonate, full-term neonate, infants, children).  Loading and maintenance doses are typically administered, with careful monitoring of the child's response and serum levels.  A healthcare professional should always determine the exact dosage.  The route of administration (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) will also influence the dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for renal impairment, and the degree of adjustment depends on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  Hepatic impairment does not typically require dosage adjustments.  Elderly patients, particularly those over 70, often require lower doses due to increased risk of toxicity.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Visual disturbances (blurred or yellow vision)

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Arrhythmias (e.g., accelerated atrioventricular junctional rhythm, asystole, atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular dissociation, complete atrioventricular block, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia)
* Altered mental status (confusion, delirium, depression)
*  Thrombocytopenia
*  Skin rash
*  Gynecomastia

If any adverse effects occur, consult a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Digoxin primarily affects the sodium-potassium pump in heart muscle cells.  By inhibiting this pump, it increases intracellular calcium, leading to stronger heart contractions (positive inotropic effect).  This improves heart function in heart failure.  In arrhythmias, digoxin slows the conduction of electrical impulses through the heart, particularly in the atrioventricular node, helping regulate heart rhythm.  It also enhances vagal tone, further slowing the heart rate.


### Precautions
Digoxin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to digoxin or other digitalis preparations and in those with ventricular fibrillation.  Use with caution in patients with acute myocardial infarction, renal impairment, and hypothyroidism.  Electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) significantly increase the risk of digoxin toxicity.  Digoxin interacts with many drugs, including some antibiotics, diuretics, and antineoplastic agents.  Careful monitoring is crucial when digoxin is co-administered with these medications.  Pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits with their physician.  Digoxin is excreted in breast milk.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store digoxin?** A: Store digoxin tablets in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Follow any specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose. Consult your physician or pharmacist for advice on what to do.

* **Q:  What are the signs of digoxin toxicity?** A: Signs of toxicity may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, visual disturbances, changes in heart rhythm, and altered mental status.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect digoxin toxicity.

* **Q: Can I take digoxin with other medications?** A: Many drugs can interact with digoxin, potentially leading to increased or decreased levels in the body.  Always inform your physician and pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Q: How often should I have my digoxin levels checked?** A: The frequency of blood level monitoring is determined by your physician based on your individual needs and response to treatment.  Regular monitoring is often important, especially in the early stages of treatment and in patients with kidney problems.
