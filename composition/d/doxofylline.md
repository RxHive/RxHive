# Doxofylline
### Generic Name
Doxofylline

### Usage
Doxofylline is a medication primarily used to treat asthma and other reversible airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive bronchitis.  It works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe.  This is particularly helpful during asthma attacks or when symptoms of chronic bronchitis are flaring up.  While its primary use is for respiratory conditions, it's important to note that Doxofylline should only be used under the direction of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Doxofylline dosage varies depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose.  Generally:

* **Adults (Asthma or Bronchoconstriction):** The typical oral dose is 400 mg twice or three times daily (BID or TID).

* **Children (Asthma):** The typical oral dose is 200 mg twice or three times daily (BID or TID).  However, pediatric dosing requires careful consideration and should always be determined by a physician.


Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer specific dosage adjustments for these situations; however, dose reduction and close monitoring of Doxofylline serum levels are generally recommended.  It's crucial to consult with a doctor before adjusting the dosage. Doxofylline is typically administered orally.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Upper abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Extrasystoles (irregular heartbeats)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
* Proteinuria (protein in the urine)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance and case reports.  These include a wide range of symptoms affecting various systems.  If any unusual or concerning side effects develop, it is vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Doxofylline is a xanthine bronchodilator.  It works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  Increasing cAMP levels leads to relaxation of the smooth muscles in the airways, widening the passages and making breathing easier. This mechanism helps alleviate symptoms associated with asthma and other obstructive airway diseases.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Doxofylline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Doxofylline, other xanthine compounds, or any component of the formulation; those with acute myocardial infarction; those with hypotension; and breastfeeding women.

* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with cardiac disease or chronic obliterative lung disease. Doxofylline toxicity is a potential risk, especially with higher doses or in individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid co-administration with products containing caffeine.  Consult a doctor about potential interactions with other medications.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Doxofylline is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. However, excretion in breast milk is unknown, and breastfeeding is contraindicated.

* **General Considerations:** Doxofylline can be taken with or without food.

### FAQs
