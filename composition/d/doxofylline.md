# Doxofylline

**Generic Name:** Doxofylline

**Usage:**

Doxofylline is a bronchodilator used to treat and prevent bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways in the lungs) in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and reversible airway obstruction associated with asthma.  It's often used for long-term management of these conditions, not for acute attacks.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and frequency based on the individual's needs and condition severity.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, doxofylline can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Restlessness
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Heart palpitations
* Tremors
* Seizures (rare, but more likely with higher doses or pre-existing conditions)


More serious, though less common, side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
* Low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia) â€“  particularly if combined with other medications
* Seizures (especially at higher doses)
* Liver damage (rare)


**How it Works:**

Doxofylline is a theophylline derivative.  Theophylline relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways of the lungs, causing them to widen. This increased airflow makes it easier to breathe.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve the inhibition of phosphodiesterase, leading to increased cyclic AMP levels, which ultimately results in bronchodilation.


**FAQs:**

* **Is doxofylline addictive?** No, doxofylline is not addictive.
* **Can I take doxofylline with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Doxofylline can interact with other drugs, including some antibiotics, cimetidine, and certain diuretics.  These interactions can either reduce the effectiveness of doxofylline or increase the risk of side effects.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take two doses at once.
* **How long does it take to work?** The onset of action can vary depending on the individual and the formulation, but effects are generally seen within a few hours.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking doxofylline?**  Consult your doctor. Alcohol can potentially interact with doxofylline and worsen some side effects.
* **Can I stop taking doxofylline suddenly?** No, you should not stop taking doxofylline suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor will likely recommend a gradual tapering off of the medication.
