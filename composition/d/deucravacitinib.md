# Deucravacitinib
### Generic Name
Deucravacitinib

### Usage

Deucravacitinib is primarily used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  This means it's prescribed for individuals whose psoriasis hasn't responded adequately to topical treatments (creams, ointments).  Currently, it is not approved for other conditions, though research into its potential use in other autoimmune diseases is ongoing.

### Dosage

**Adults (Plaque Psoriasis):** The recommended dose is 6 mg taken orally once daily.  This should be taken with or without food.  The tablets should not be crushed or chewed.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of deucravacitinib in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.  Deucravacitinib is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Upper respiratory infections
* Other infections (including pneumonia and COVID-19)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers, tongue ulceration, and stomatitis)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Acne (including cystic acne and acneiform dermatitis)
* Herpes simplex
* Folliculitis
* Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels


**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**

* Herpes zoster (shingles)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Deucravacitinib can increase the risk of serious infections, malignancies (including lymphomas), hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema), rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), and significant elevations in CPK levels.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any serious side effects occur.

### How it Works

Deucravacitinib is a tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor.  TYK2 is a type of enzyme involved in immune responses. By inhibiting TYK2, deucravacitinib helps to reduce the overactive immune response that contributes to plaque psoriasis.  The exact mechanism by which this inhibition leads to improvement in psoriasis symptoms is not fully understood.
