# Diacetylmorphine (Heroin)
### Generic Name
Diacetylmorphine (Heroin)

### Usage

Diacetylmorphine, also known as diamorphine, is a potent opioid analgesic.  Its primary use is for the management of severe pain, particularly in situations where other analgesics have proven insufficient. This includes pain associated with surgical procedures, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), terminal illnesses, and cancer.  A notable secondary use is in the relief of dyspnea (shortness of breath) in patients experiencing acute pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs).  It's crucial to understand that diacetylmorphine's use is strictly controlled due to its high potential for abuse and dependence.  It's typically reserved for situations where other, less addictive pain medications are ineffective or unsuitable.

### Dosage

Dosage of diacetylmorphine varies greatly depending on the patient's condition, prior opioid use, and route of administration.  Precise dosage should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional.  The information below provides general ranges and should not be interpreted as a prescription.

**Adults:**

* **Dyspnea (IV):** 2.5-5 mg as a slow intravenous injection (1 mg/min). The dose and frequency are adjusted based on the response to treatment.
* **Dyspnea (Oral):** Initial dose 5-10 mg every 4 hours as needed.  Dosage adjustments are made based on the patient's response.
* **Pain Management (IM/SubQ):**  Opioid-naive patients may start with 5-10 mg every 4 hours as needed,  adjusting the dose based on pain control. Continuous subcutaneous infusion may be used for persistent pain. Breakthrough pain may be managed with one-sixth of the total 24-hour subcutaneous infusion dose.
* **Pain Management (IV):** Opioid-naive patients may start with 2.5-5 mg every 4 hours as needed, adjusting the dose based on pain control. Continuous intravenous infusion may be used for persistent pain; for acute myocardial infarction analgesia, an initial dose of 5 mg as a slow intravenous injection (1mg/minute) may be given, followed by 2.5-5 mg as needed.
* **Pain Management (Oral):** Opioid-naive patients may start with 5-10 mg every 4 hours as needed, titrating the dose to achieve adequate pain relief.

**Children and Adolescents:** Use is extremely limited and generally reserved for terminally ill children with neoplastic diseases where oral administration is difficult. Doses are significantly reduced and carefully titrated according to age, weight, symptom severity, and prior opioid use.  Always under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not clearly defined in standard guidelines.  Healthcare professionals often proceed with caution, using lower doses and carefully monitoring patients for adverse effects.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Headache
* Itching
* Sweating

Less common but serious side effects:

* Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing â€“ a medical emergency)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis in rare cases)
* Dependence and addiction


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience serious side effects.**

### How it Works

Diacetylmorphine is rapidly metabolized in the body to morphine, its active metabolite. Morphine binds to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain and causing feelings of euphoria and relaxation.  It also affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, leading to potential side effects in those areas.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Diacetylmorphine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to morphine or diacetylmorphine, those concurrently using monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), patients with biliary colic, acute alcohol use disorder, increased risk of paralytic ileus, asthma attack, respiratory depression, obstructive airway diseases, pheochromocytoma, increased intracranial pressure, and head injuries.
* **Drug Interactions:** Diacetylmorphine interacts with various medications, including other opioids, sedatives, and alcohol.  Healthcare professionals must be informed of all medications being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Diacetylmorphine crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk. It's not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Elderly and Debilitated Patients:**  These populations are particularly vulnerable to the side effects of diacetylmorphine and require careful monitoring and dose adjustments.
* **Substance Abuse History:**  Patients with a history of substance abuse have a significantly increased risk of misuse and dependence.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is diacetylmorphine addictive?** A: Yes, diacetylmorphine is highly addictive, with a strong potential for abuse and dependence.

* **Q: How should I store diacetylmorphine?** A:  Store as directed by your healthcare professional, typically in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets.  Specific storage requirements depend on the form of the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not attempt to make up for missed doses. Contact your healthcare professional for guidance.

* **Q: Can I stop taking diacetylmorphine suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping diacetylmorphine after prolonged use can lead to serious withdrawal symptoms.  Always taper the dose under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of diacetylmorphine use?** A:  Long-term use can lead to severe physical and psychological dependence, organ damage, and various health complications.
