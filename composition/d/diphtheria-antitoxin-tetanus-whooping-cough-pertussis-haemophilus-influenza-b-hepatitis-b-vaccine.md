# Diphtheria Antitoxin + Tetanus + Whooping Cough (Pertussis) + Haemophilus Influenza B + Hepatitis B Vaccine
### Generic Name
Diphtheria Antitoxin + Tetanus + Whooping Cough (Pertussis) + Haemophilus Influenza B + Hepatitis B Vaccine

### Usage
This combination vaccine is used to actively immunize infants and children up to 2 years of age against five diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), diseases caused by *Haemophilus influenzae* type b, and hepatitis B.  It provides primary immunization and booster shots to build and maintain protection against these potentially serious illnesses.

### Dosage
**Pediatric Dosage (Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and *Haemophilus* B disease prevention):**

* **Primary Immunization (Infants 6 weeks to 1 year):**  The vaccine is given intramuscularly (IM) as a 0.5 mL dose.  Three doses are given at intervals of at least one month.  Infants who received a single hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth can begin this 3-dose series at 6 weeks of age.

* **Booster Immunization:** A 0.5 mL booster dose is administered at 13-24 months of age.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Eating disorder

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
This combination vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the five targeted diseases.  The diphtheria antitoxin provides passive immunity against diphtheria, while the toxoids (inactivated toxins) for tetanus and pertussis, and the inactivated components for *H. influenzae* type b and Hepatitis B, stimulate active immunity by triggering the body to create its own protective antibodies.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any of its components, acute febrile illness, or those who experienced encephalopathy (brain damage) after a previous pertussis-containing vaccine (not attributable to another identifiable cause). Patients with existing encephalopathy, convulsions, or other neurologic disorders should avoid the pertussis component.

* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, syncope (fainting), seizures, Arthus-type hypersensitivity, reactions related to prior pertussis vaccination, and shoulder injury following vaccine administration.

* **Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders, those who have experienced Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome within six weeks of a prior tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, and patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can this vaccine be mixed with other vaccines?** A: No, this vaccine should not be mixed with other vaccines or injections.  Use separate needles and syringes for each injection.

* **Q: What should I do if my child has a fever after the shot?** A:  A mild fever is a common side effect.  You can use an age-appropriate antipyretic (such as acetaminophen) to manage fever and discomfort.  However, for high fevers or concerning symptoms, contact a healthcare provider.

* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.  Generally, vaccines should be refrigerated at a consistent temperature.

* **Q:  Is this vaccine safe during pregnancy?** A:  This vaccine is not indicated for women of childbearing age.
