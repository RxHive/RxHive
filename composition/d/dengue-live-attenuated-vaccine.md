# Dengue Live Attenuated Vaccine
### Generic Name
Dengue Live Attenuated Vaccine

### Usage
The dengue live attenuated vaccine is used to prevent dengue fever.  Dengue fever is caused by any of four related viruses (serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4). This vaccine is specifically indicated for individuals aged 9â€“16 years who have *previously* had a laboratory-confirmed dengue infection and live in dengue-endemic areas.  Crucially, this vaccine is *not* approved for individuals who have never had dengue fever or whose infection history is unknown.  Administering the vaccine to someone without prior infection significantly increases the risk of severe dengue disease.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** This vaccine should only be given to individuals with prior, laboratory-confirmed dengue infection residing in endemic areas.  Pre-vaccination serological testing to confirm prior infection is recommended if documentation is unavailable.

* **Children and Adolescents (9-16 years):**  A 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SubQ) injection is given in three doses. The doses are administered at 0, 6, and 12 months.

* **Adults and Children <9 years:**  The vaccine is not approved for use in individuals over 16 years or under 9 years of age.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in these groups.


### Side Effects
The following side effects have been reported:

**Common (affecting more than 10% of recipients):**

* Headache
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Pain at the injection site
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Asthenia (weakness or fatigue)

**Less Common (affecting 1-10% of recipients):**

* Swelling at the injection site

**Rare (less than 1%, post-marketing reports and/or case reports):**

* Abdominal pain
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Erythema (redness of the skin)
* Hematoma at injection site
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Itching at the injection site
* Local anesthesia at the injection site
* Status asthmaticus (severe asthma attack)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Vomiting


Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works
The dengue live attenuated vaccine works by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against the four dengue virus serotypes.  While the precise mechanism of protection isn't fully understood, the vaccine elicits a dengue-specific immune response, helping to protect against future infection.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Severe hypersensitivity to the vaccine or any of its components.
* Severe immunodeficiency or immunosuppression due to illness or treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunosuppressive drugs, including high-dose corticosteroids).


**Warnings:**

*  There's an increased risk of severe dengue disease if the vaccine is given to someone who has *not* had a prior dengue infection.
* The risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions and syncope (fainting) is increased.
* The vaccine's safety and effectiveness haven't been established for individuals living in non-endemic areas who travel to endemic areas.
* Simultaneous administration of other age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) is generally recommended, unless contraindicated.  However, live vaccines should be separated by at least 4 weeks.
*  The vaccine may not provide immunity in all individuals.


**Drug Interactions:**  Several medications may affect the vaccine's efficacy or increase the risk of adverse effects.  These include, but aren't limited to, acetaminophen, azathioprine, corticosteroids, immune globulins, and other immunosuppressants. Consult a healthcare professional regarding potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.


**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of this vaccine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  The decision to vaccinate during these periods should involve a careful consideration of risks and benefits.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for the vaccine to be effective?** A:  Full protection isn't immediately established after the vaccination series.  It takes time for the body to develop an adequate immune response.
* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?** A: The vaccine should be kept refrigerated until administration.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects, such as pain at the injection site, usually resolve on their own.  Contact your doctor if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.
* **Q: Can I get the vaccine if I have other health conditions?** A:  This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with severe immunodeficiency or hypersensitivity. It's crucial to discuss any pre-existing health conditions with your doctor before receiving the vaccine.
* **Q: Is this vaccine safe for everyone?** A: No.  This vaccine is specifically for individuals aged 9-16 years with prior laboratory-confirmed dengue infection and living in dengue-endemic areas.
