# Dutasteride
### Generic Name
Dutasteride

### Usage
Dutasteride is primarily used to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as an enlarged prostate.  It improves urinary symptoms associated with BPH, such as difficulty urinating, weak urine stream, frequent urination, and nighttime urination.  Furthermore, dutasteride reduces the risk of acute urinary retention (sudden inability to urinate) and the need for surgery related to BPH.  It can be used alone or in combination with other medications, such as tamsulosin, to manage BPH symptoms more effectively.  **It is important to note that dutasteride is not approved for the prevention of prostate cancer.**  Before starting dutasteride, other urological conditions, including prostate cancer, should be ruled out.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults is 0.5 mg once daily, taken orally. This can be administered alone or in combination with tamsulosin.  Dutasteride is not indicated for use in children, and its safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are generally not necessary, although caution is advised in individuals with severe hepatic impairment due to the drug's extensive liver metabolism.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Decreased libido (sex drive) – most prevalent during the first six months of treatment
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement or tenderness)
* Impotence (erectile dysfunction) – most prevalent during the first six months of treatment
* Ejaculatory disorder

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* High-grade prostate cancer (increased risk)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives)
* Cardiac failure
* Depression
* Testicular pain or swelling

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Dutasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.  5-alpha-reductase is an enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  DHT plays a significant role in the growth of the prostate gland. By inhibiting this enzyme, dutasteride reduces DHT levels in the body, leading to a decrease in prostate size and consequently, an improvement in BPH symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dutasteride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to dutasteride, other 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride), or any component of the formulation.  It is absolutely contraindicated in pregnant women.
* **Pregnancy:** Dutasteride is classified as Category X for pregnancy.  It can cause fetal harm if exposed during pregnancy.  Pregnant women or women who may become pregnant should not handle dutasteride capsules due to potential skin absorption.  
* **Interactions:**  The effects of dutasteride may be increased by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor before starting dutasteride.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Blood Donation:** Avoid donating blood during treatment and for six months after stopping treatment due to the risk of unintended exposure to a pregnant female recipient.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dutasteride with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.  Certain interactions may occur, particularly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  It may take several months to see a significant improvement in symptoms.  Consistent use is essential.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store dutasteride?** A: Store dutasteride at room temperature, away from moisture and light, and out of the reach of children.
* **Q: Can dutasteride affect my fertility?** A: Dutasteride has been shown to affect semen parameters (sperm count, volume, motility). The impact on male fertility is not fully understood.  Discuss any concerns about fertility with your doctor.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking dutasteride abruptly?** A:  No, do not stop taking dutasteride without consulting your doctor.  Stopping the medication abruptly may lead to a return of symptoms.
