# Dyflos
### Generic Name
Dyflos (Demecarium Bromide)

### Usage
Dyflos (demecarium bromide) is a cholinesterase inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma, especially in patients who have had their eye lenses surgically removed (aphakic patients) and when other glaucoma medications have been ineffective.  It was also historically used in the diagnosis and management of accommodative convergent strabismus (a type of eye misalignment).  It's important to note that Dyflos is currently discontinued from the market and is no longer readily available.

### Dosage
**Because Dyflos is no longer available, dosage information is provided for historical context only and should not be used for treatment.**  Prescribing information varied depending on the specific condition and patient response.  It was typically administered as eye drops, with dosage carefully tailored by an ophthalmologist.  Children and adults would have received different dosages based on their age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  Frequency of administration also varied.  Precise dosage details would have been determined on an individual basis by a physician.

### Side Effects
**Please note:  This information is for historical reference only, as the drug is no longer available.**  Common side effects associated with Dyflos could include:

* Blurred vision
* Eye pain
* Headache
* Conjunctival injection (redness of the eye's conjunctiva)
* Miosis (constriction of the pupils)
* Reduced visual acuity
* Eyelid spasms
* Increased tearing

Less common, but more serious side effects, could include:

* Allergic reactions
* Iris cysts
* Retinal detachment (separation of the retina from the underlying tissue)
* Severe and persistent eye pain


**If you experienced any adverse effects while using Dyflos in the past, it's recommended you consult a healthcare professional.**

### How it Works
Dyflos is an irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterases.  Cholinesterases are enzymes that break down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for nerve impulse transmission, including in the eye. By inhibiting cholinesterases, Dyflos causes an accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites in the eye. This increased acetylcholine leads to effects similar to those of excessive stimulation of cholinergic receptors, resulting in improved drainage of fluid from the eye and lowering intraocular pressure – a key feature in managing glaucoma.

### Precautions
**This information is purely for historical reference, given that Dyflos is discontinued.**  The use of Dyflos required careful monitoring by an ophthalmologist due to its potential for significant side effects.  Particular caution would have been necessary in patients with:

* Certain heart conditions
* Asthma or other respiratory conditions
* Other pre-existing eye conditions
* Pregnancy or breastfeeding


The drug’s vapors were highly toxic, necessitating careful handling to avoid inhalation and skin contact.  Interaction with other medications was also a potential concern, highlighting the need for a physician to review the patient's complete medical history and medication list.
