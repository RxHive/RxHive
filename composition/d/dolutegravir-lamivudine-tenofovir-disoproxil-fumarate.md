# Dolutegravir + Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

**Generic Name:** Dolutegravir/Lamivudine/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (various brand names exist)

**Usage:**  This combination drug is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults and adolescents weighing at least 40 kg (approximately 88 lbs).  It's a complete regimen, meaning it doesn't require additional HIV medications to be effective.  It's typically used as a first-line treatment for HIV, meaning it's often the initial medication prescribed.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment are determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response to the medication.  **It is crucial to understand that this medication does not cure HIV; it manages the infection and suppresses the virus to undetectable levels.**

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination drug can cause side effects. Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, insomnia
* **Skin:** Rash
* **Renal (Kidney):**  Elevated creatinine levels (a marker of kidney function), especially with tenofovir.  Regular kidney function monitoring is necessary.
* **Musculoskeletal:** Muscle pain, weakness
* **Metabolic:** Changes in lipid levels (cholesterol and triglycerides), changes in blood sugar levels


More serious, but less common side effects can include:

* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  Liver enzyme abnormalities.
* **Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS):**  Inflammation that can occur as the immune system recovers.
* **Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (fatty liver):**  A rare but serious condition.
* **Renal failure:** In rare cases, particularly those with pre-existing kidney issues.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Severe allergic reactions.


This list is not exhaustive, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary from person to person.  It's essential to report any concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.


**How it Works:** This combination drug works by targeting different stages of the HIV lifecycle:

* **Dolutegravir:**  An integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  It prevents the HIV virus from integrating its genetic material into the DNA of human cells, thus stopping viral replication.

* **Lamivudine:**  A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). It interferes with the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is essential for the virus to replicate its genetic material.

* **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate:** An NRTI.  Similar to lamivudine, it inhibits reverse transcriptase, preventing viral replication.


The combination of these three medications provides a powerful synergistic effect, significantly suppressing HIV replication and improving immune function.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol use can have negative interactions with the medication and can harm the liver, which is already under some stress due to the medication and the virus. Consult your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take other medications with this?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting this combination therapy. Some medications can interact negatively.

* **Q: How often do I need blood tests?** A: Regular blood tests to monitor kidney function, liver function, and viral load are essential while on this medication.  The frequency of these tests will be determined by your doctor.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Signs of serious side effects include severe rash, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), severe abdominal pain, persistent nausea or vomiting, significant muscle pain, difficulty breathing, or any other unusual symptoms.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.

* **Q: Will this medication cure HIV?** A: No, this medication does not cure HIV.  It suppresses the virus to undetectable levels, which significantly improves quality of life and prevents transmission.  It must be taken consistently as prescribed for optimal effectiveness.
