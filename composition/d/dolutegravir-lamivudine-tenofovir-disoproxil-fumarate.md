# Dolutegravir + Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
### Generic Name
Dolutegravir + Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (often abbreviated as DTG/3TC/TDF)


### Usage
This combination medication is a complete antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen used primarily to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents weighing at least 40 kg.  It's a crucial part of managing HIV, aiming to reduce the viral load to undetectable levels and improve the CD4+ T-cell count (a key indicator of immune system health).  This, in turn, helps to prevent the progression of HIV to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and opportunistic infections. While its primary use is treating HIV-1, it is not effective against HIV-2.


### Dosage

**Adults and Adolescents (≥40 kg):**  The typical dose is one tablet taken orally once daily, with or without food.  Consistency is key; missing doses can lead to treatment failure and drug resistance.

**Children (<40 kg):**  This particular combination is not typically formulated for children under 40 kg.  Alternative pediatric formulations of individual components or different ART combinations are usually prescribed, tailored to the child's weight and age.  A doctor should always determine the appropriate dosage for children.

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:** Dolutegravir + Lamivudine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not available in an intravenous form. Each component may be available separately in IV forms, but they are not typically combined for intravenous administration.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary for individuals with certain kidney or liver problems.  A healthcare professional should always assess individual needs and adjust the dosage accordingly.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Rash


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Liver problems (hepatitis)
* Kidney problems (renal impairment)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Changes in bone mineral density
* Depression
* Increased risk of lactic acidosis (buildup of lactic acid in the blood)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

This triple combination medication works by targeting different stages of the HIV life cycle.

* **Dolutegravir (DTG):** This is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). It prevents the HIV virus from integrating its genetic material into the DNA of human cells, stopping the virus from replicating.

* **Lamivudine (3TC):**  This is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). It interferes with the process of reverse transcription, preventing the HIV virus from converting its RNA into DNA, a necessary step for replication.

* **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF):** Another NRTI, similar to lamivudine, it inhibits reverse transcription by acting as a "fake" building block in the DNA chain, halting further viral replication.


By combining these three medications, the chances of viral resistance are significantly reduced, leading to more effective HIV suppression.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated for individuals with known hypersensitivity to any of its components.  Pre-existing liver or kidney disease requires careful monitoring and may necessitate dose adjustments or alternative treatment.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Numerous interactions are possible with other medications, including some common over-the-counter drugs. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, careful monitoring is essential.  The benefits of treatment usually outweigh the risks, but this should be discussed with a doctor.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may have a higher risk of certain side effects, requiring close monitoring.

* **Children:**  As mentioned earlier, this specific combination is usually not prescribed for children under 40 kg due to the lack of suitable pediatric formulations.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with alcohol?** A: While moderate alcohol consumption may not always be problematic, it’s best to discuss alcohol use with your doctor.  Excessive alcohol use can negatively affect the liver, potentially exacerbating side effects.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.  Consistency is essential for effective treatment.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking this medication when I feel better?** A:  Absolutely not.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug resistance, making future treatment far more challenging.  Continue taking the medication as prescribed by your doctor even if you feel well.  Regular monitoring of viral load is crucial for the long-term success of the therapy.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of this medication?**  A:  Long-term use may be associated with some side effects like changes in bone mineral density or kidney function, so regular monitoring is crucial.  Your doctor will discuss any potential long-term effects and necessary precautions with you.  The benefits of suppressing the HIV virus significantly outweigh the risks of long-term side effects.
