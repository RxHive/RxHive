# Doxofylline + Salbutamol

**Generic Name:** Doxofylline + Salbutamol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat reversible airway obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It's often prescribed for those who experience symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.  It's crucial to remember that this is a symptomatic treatment and doesn't address the underlying cause of the condition.  The prescription will be tailored to the individual's needs and severity of their condition.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Doxofylline + Salbutamol can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **From Salbutamol:** Tremors, headache, palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat), muscle cramps, nervousness, insomnia, increased heart rate.  Severe reactions are rare but can include paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties).
* **From Doxofylline:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, headache, dizziness.  Less common but more serious side effects include seizures (rare, especially with higher doses), heart rhythm problems, and liver problems.

It's important to note that this isn't an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


**How it Works:** This combination drug works through two different mechanisms:

* **Salbutamol (a beta-2 agonist):** Relaxes the muscles in the airways, widening the passages and making it easier to breathe. This provides quick relief from bronchospasm.
* **Doxofylline (a theophylline derivative):** Relaxes the airways and reduces inflammation, providing longer-lasting relief than salbutamol alone. It also has bronchodilating effects and helps clear mucus from the airways.

The combination of these two drugs offers both rapid and sustained relief from respiratory symptoms.
