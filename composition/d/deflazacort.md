# Deflazacort
### Generic Name
Deflazacort

### Usage
Deflazacort is primarily used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients aged 2 years and older.  It's a corticosteroid, meaning it reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system. While its precise mechanism in DMD isn't fully understood, it's believed to help slow the progression of muscle weakness and improve muscle function.  It's important to note that deflazacort is not a cure for DMD, but rather a treatment to manage its symptoms.  Off-label uses of deflazacort, mirroring other corticosteroids, exist for various inflammatory conditions, but these should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):**

* **Adults and children aged 2 years and older (oral):** The usual dose is 0.9 mg/kg/day, administered once daily.  Dosage should be rounded up to the nearest possible dose when using tablets, or to the nearest tenth of a milliliter when using suspension.  The medication should be discontinued gradually after more than a few days of use.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally needed for mild to moderate impairment.  However, for severe hepatic impairment, specific dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling, and caution is advised.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is necessary, but use should be cautious.

**Administration:**

* **Tablets:** Can be administered whole or crushed and mixed immediately with applesauce.
* **Suspension:** Shake well before each use. Measure the dose with the provided dispenser, mix thoroughly with 3-4 ounces of juice or milk (excluding grapefruit juice), and administer immediately.

### How it Works

Deflazacort is a corticosteroid prodrug.  This means it's converted in the body to its active form, 21-desDFZ, which binds to glucocorticoid receptors in cells. This interaction reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system. While deflazacort's exact mechanism in DMD remains unclear, it's thought to help slow the progression of muscle damage.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Deflazacort is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to deflazacort or any component of the formulation.
* **Warnings:** Deflazacort can suppress the adrenal glands, increase the risk of infections, and cause various other side effects, including psychiatric disturbances, bone loss, and increased risk of thromboembolic events.  It's crucial to monitor for these.  Use with caution in patients with heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, gastrointestinal issues, severe hepatic impairment, renal impairment, myasthenia gravis, osteoporosis, pheochromocytoma, seizure disorders, and systemic sclerosis.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of deflazacort during pregnancy is unknown.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised.
* **Drug Interactions:** Deflazacort can interact with many other medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pediatric Use:**  Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 2 years of age. Long-term use in children may affect growth.
* **Immunizations:** Live vaccines should be administered at least 4-6 weeks before starting deflazacort.
