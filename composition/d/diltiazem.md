# Diltiazem
### Generic Name
Diltiazem

### Usage

Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker primarily used to treat several cardiovascular conditions.  Its main uses include:

* **Hypertension (high blood pressure):** Diltiazem helps relax blood vessels, reducing the force of blood against artery walls, thus lowering blood pressure.

* **Chronic stable angina (chest pain):** By widening coronary arteries, Diltiazem improves blood flow to the heart, relieving chest pain caused by reduced blood supply.

* **Vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal's angina):** This type of angina is caused by spasms in the coronary arteries. Diltiazem's ability to relax blood vessels effectively manages these spasms and associated chest pain.

* **Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (irregular heartbeats):** In these conditions, Diltiazem is used to control the rapid ventricular (heart chamber) rate, improving heart rhythm stability. It's particularly useful for acute rate control.  It may also be used off-label for chronic rate control.

* **Supraventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeat):** Diltiazem can be used both acutely (IV) and chronically (oral) to slow the heart rate in various types of supraventricular tachycardias.

Diltiazem also has off-label uses, including management of chest pain related to cocaine use, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.  However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for these off-label applications.

### Dosage

Diltiazem dosages vary significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation (immediate-release, extended-release, intravenous).  The following information is for general guidance only and should not replace a doctor's prescription:

**Adults:** Dosages are highly individualized and usually started low and gradually increased.  Specific doses for hypertension, angina, and atrial fibrillation/flutter are described in the detailed prescribing information. Intravenous administration requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.

**Children:** Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight and are significantly lower than adult doses. A healthcare professional must determine the appropriate pediatric dosage.

**Dosage Forms:** Diltiazem is available in immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets and capsules, and intravenous solutions.  Extended-release formulations should not be crushed or chewed.

**Important Note:** Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.  Never alter your prescribed dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of Diltiazem can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Swelling in the ankles and feet (peripheral edema)
* Fatigue

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Heart block
* Liver damage
* Allergic reactions (including skin rashes, itching, and rarely, severe reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome)

If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker.  Calcium plays a vital role in muscle contraction, including the heart muscle and blood vessel walls. Diltiazem works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into these cells. This results in:

* **Relaxation of blood vessels:**  This reduces blood pressure and improves blood flow to the heart.
* **Slowing of the heart rate:** This is particularly beneficial in conditions with rapid heartbeats.

By affecting calcium influx in specific cardiac cells, Diltiazem regulates heart rate and rhythm and eases the strain on the heart.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Diltiazem is contraindicated in patients with certain heart conditions, including severe heart block, sick sinus syndrome (without a pacemaker), and severe hypotension. It is also contraindicated during pregnancy.  It should be used cautiously with IV beta-blockers.

* **Drug Interactions:** Diltiazem interacts with many other medications, including some heart medications, antidepressants, and antibiotics. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Special Populations:**  Individuals with liver or kidney impairment, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers require special considerations and may need dosage adjustments.

* **Warnings:**  Diltiazem can cause dizziness and low blood pressure, potentially leading to falls. Caution is advised when driving or engaging in activities requiring alertness. Abruptly stopping Diltiazem can worsen underlying heart conditions, so gradual discontinuation under medical supervision is crucial.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Diltiazem?** A: It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking Diltiazem, as it can increase the risk of low blood pressure and dizziness.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Diltiazem suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking Diltiazem suddenly without consulting your doctor. Abrupt cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure and potentially trigger other serious cardiovascular events.  It must be tapered off gradually.

* **Q: How should I store Diltiazem?** A: Store Diltiazem at room temperature, away from moisture and heat, as directed on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
