# Dicyclomine + Mefenamic Acid
### Generic Name
Dicyclomine + Mefenamic Acid

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat moderate to severe pain associated with menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea).  Dicyclomine, an antispasmodic, helps relax the muscles in the uterus, reducing cramping. Mefenamic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces inflammation and pain.  While its primary use is for menstrual cramps, it might be considered, under a doctor's strict supervision, for other types of abdominal pain where muscle spasms and inflammation are contributing factors. However, it's crucial to understand this is *not* a first-line treatment for most types of pain and should only be used as directed by a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined and supervised by a healthcare professional.  There's no single standardized dosage for this combination as formulations vary.  A doctor will prescribe the specific dosage based on your individual needs, age, and the severity of your symptoms. Generally, it involves taking one or two tablets or capsules at a time, several times a day as needed for pain.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**  There are no established IV formulations for this combination; it's typically administered orally.  Pediatric use is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a pediatrician due to limited safety data in children.

### How it Works

Dicyclomine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes muscle contractions. By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, dicyclomine helps to relax the smooth muscles in the uterus, thereby alleviating cramping pain. Mefenamic acid inhibits the production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that contribute to inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, mefenamic acid decreases both inflammation and pain sensations. The combination of these two actions provides a more comprehensive approach to managing menstrual cramps.
