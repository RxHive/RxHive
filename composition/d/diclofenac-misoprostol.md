# Diclofenac + Misoprostol

**Generic Name:** Diclofenac + Misoprostol

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analogue that protects the stomach lining from the damaging effects of diclofenac.  Diclofenac's anti-inflammatory effect makes it suitable for treating arthritis, while misoprostol helps prevent the serious gastrointestinal side effects (like ulcers and bleeding) commonly associated with NSAIDs.  This combination is often prescribed for patients who need pain relief from arthritis but are at increased risk of stomach problems from NSAIDs alone.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea (a common and sometimes severe side effect of misoprostol), abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, bloating, gas.  Serious side effects like stomach ulcers and bleeding are less common but possible.
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (particularly with long-term use).
* **Other:**  Skin rash, itching, swelling, fluid retention.


**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:** Works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, diclofenac decreases pain and swelling in joints.

* **Misoprostol:**  Works by increasing the production of protective mucus in the stomach lining.  It also helps maintain normal blood flow to the stomach lining, thus reducing the risk of ulceration and bleeding that can be caused by diclofenac.
