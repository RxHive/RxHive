# Deferoxamine

**Generic Name:** Deferoxamine

**Usage:** Deferoxamine is used to treat iron overload in patients with:

* **Transfusional hemosiderosis:**  This occurs when patients receive many blood transfusions, leading to a buildup of iron in the body.
* **Thalassemia major:** A severe form of inherited anemia requiring frequent blood transfusions.
* **Other anemias requiring chronic transfusions:**  Conditions such as sickle cell anemia may necessitate regular transfusions, resulting in iron overload.
* **Acute iron poisoning:**  Although less common, deferoxamine can be used in cases of accidental or intentional iron overdose.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Mild side effects:**  These may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, fever, skin rash, and flushing.
* **Serious side effects (although less common):** These can include:
    * **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Especially in patients receiving rapid infusions.
    * **Cardiomyopathy (heart muscle damage):**  Long-term use is associated with a small risk.
    * **Renal failure (kidney damage):**  Rare but possible, particularly with high doses or impaired kidney function.
    * **Retinopathy (eye damage):**  Though rare, vision changes should be reported immediately.
    * **Allergic reactions:**  Such as hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.
    * **Infections:**  Deferoxamine can potentially increase susceptibility to infections.
    * **Hearing loss (ototoxicity):**  A rare but serious side effect.

It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Deferoxamine is a chelating agent.  This means it binds to iron in the body, forming a complex that can be excreted through the urine. This helps remove excess iron that accumulates in the organs and tissues from blood transfusions or other sources.  The iron-deferoxamine complex is less toxic than free iron and is safely eliminated by the kidneys.


**FAQs:**

* **How is Deferoxamine administered?** Deferoxamine is typically given intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection, often at night through a pump. Oral formulations are not as effective.
* **How long will I need treatment?** Treatment duration depends on the severity of iron overload and individual response.  It can range from several months to many years.
* **What are the monitoring requirements?** Regular blood tests (iron studies, liver and kidney function tests) are necessary to monitor iron levels and assess organ function during deferoxamine therapy.  Eye and hearing exams may also be recommended, especially with prolonged use.
* **Are there any drug interactions?** Yes, deferoxamine can interact with certain medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Is Deferoxamine safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.  A doctor should make the final decision regarding its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
