# Diphenoxylate + Atropine
### Generic Name
Diphenoxylate + Atropine

### Usage

Diphenoxylate + Atropine is primarily used as an antidiarrheal medication.  It's typically used for the symptomatic relief of acute, nonspecific diarrhea in adults and children (dosing varies by age and weight).  This combination medication isn't intended to treat the underlying cause of diarrhea; instead, it helps manage the symptoms by slowing down bowel movements.  It's considered an adjunctive therapy, meaning it works best when used alongside measures to address the root cause of diarrhea (such as rehydration and identifying foodborne illness).  It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause of the diarrhea and the appropriate course of treatment.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Diarrhea):**

* **Oral Tablets (Diphenoxylate 5mg + Atropine 0.025mg):** The usual starting dose is one tablet four times a day (QID) until diarrhea is controlled.  The maximum daily dose is 20mg of diphenoxylate (four tablets).  Once initial control is achieved, the dose should be reduced significantly; maintenance doses may be as low as one-fourth of the initial dose.  If no improvement is seen within 10 days of using the maximum dose, discontinue use and seek medical advice.

**Pediatric Dosage (Diarrhea):**  Dosing is complex and depends on the child's weight and age.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions. Dosages are typically provided as a liquid formulation (e.g., 2.5mg diphenoxylate/0.025mg atropine per 5mL). Weight-based and age-based dosing guidelines are available, but a doctor should determine the correct dose for a child.  

* **Weight-based:**  The liquid may be dosed at 0.3-0.4mg/kg/day of diphenoxylate, divided into four doses. The maximum daily dose is 10mg of diphenoxylate.
* **Age-based:** Specific dosage ranges are defined by age and weight, but  this should always be determined by a doctor.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, extreme caution is advised in patients with abnormal liver or kidney function, especially in cases of advanced hepatorenal disease.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, nausea.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Confusion, hallucinations, difficulty urinating, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), abdominal pain, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).
* **Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any side effects, even those not listed, consult your doctor or pharmacist.


### How it Works

Diphenoxylate works by slowing down the movement of the intestines (reducing motility). This helps to reduce the frequency of bowel movements and solidify the stool.  The atropine included in the formulation serves to reduce the risk of accidental or intentional overdose of diphenoxylate.  Atropine, an anticholinergic agent, acts on the parasympathetic nervous system reducing the likelihood of misuse by causing unpleasant side effects if ingested in large quantities.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Diphenoxylate + Atropine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the components, obstructive jaundice, diarrhea associated with *Clostridioides difficile* (C. diff) infection, or other enterotoxin-producing bacteria.  In addition, tablets are not suitable for children under 6 years old.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment, acute ulcerative colitis, or those taking other medications that can interact with it. The risk of atropinism (dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention) increases with higher doses.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of diphenoxylate + atropine during pregnancy is unknown, and it is excreted in breast milk.  Consult your healthcare provider before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Diphenoxylate + Atropine can interact with many other medications, including those for the central nervous system, anticholinergics, and others.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication and require lower doses.
