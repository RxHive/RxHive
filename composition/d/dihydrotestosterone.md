# Dihydrotestosterone
### Generic Name
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)

### Usage
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a potent androgenic hormone, a metabolite of testosterone.  Its primary use is in the treatment of hypogonadism, a condition characterized by the body's inability to produce sufficient testosterone.  This deficiency can lead to various symptoms like reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle mass, and fatigue. DHT is sometimes used off-label in the management of certain types of hair loss, although this application is less common and often controversial due to potential side effects.  It is crucial to remember that DHT should only be used under strict medical supervision and is not a first-line treatment for hair loss.

### Dosage
The dosage of DHT varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated, the individual's response, and the form of administration.  There is no standardized, universally accepted dosage for DHT, as its use is largely limited to specialized clinical scenarios.  Dosage and administration are determined entirely by a physician and are highly individualized.  Different forms of DHT, such as topical gels or injections, will also have distinct administration instructions.  **It is absolutely critical to follow your physician's instructions precisely and never adjust the dosage yourself.**

### Side Effects
Common side effects of DHT can include:

* Acne
* Increased hair growth (hirsutism)
* Prostate enlargement
* Increased aggression or irritability
* Fluid retention
* Gynecomastia (in rare cases, despite DHT not being directly aromatized,  it can indirectly influence estrogen levels)
* Liver problems (with certain forms of administration)

Less common but serious side effects can include:

* Heart problems
* Blood clots
* Sleep disturbances


If any adverse effects occur, it is imperative to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
DHT works by binding to androgen receptors in various tissues throughout the body.  This binding triggers a cascade of cellular events that promote the development and maintenance of male characteristics. In the context of hypogonadism, this replenishes the lack of naturally occurring androgens, alleviating symptoms.  In hair loss treatment (off-label use), its mechanism is less clearly understood, but it’s theorized to involve stimulation of hair follicles, though research supporting this remains limited and debated.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** DHT is contraindicated in individuals with prostate cancer or a history of prostate cancer, as it can stimulate prostate growth.  It is also contraindicated in individuals with significant liver dysfunction.
* **Drug Interactions:** DHT can interact with other medications, particularly those affecting hormone levels or liver function.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** DHT should not be used by pregnant or breastfeeding women.  The potential risks to the fetus or infant are significant.
* **Children:**  DHT is generally not used in children unless under extremely specialized medical circumstances.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults are generally at higher risk for the side effects associated with DHT, such as prostate enlargement.  Careful monitoring is required.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use DHT for hair loss without a doctor's prescription?**  A: No.  DHT is not approved for this purpose in many jurisdictions, and using it without medical supervision is dangerous and can lead to serious side effects.
* **Q: How is DHT stored?** A:  Storage guidelines will vary depending on the specific formulation. Always follow the instructions provided by your pharmacist. Generally, it's best to store DHT in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q:  How long does it take to see results from DHT treatment?** A: The time it takes to see results varies widely depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  Significant improvements usually aren’t seen quickly.  Discuss expectations with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not try to make up for a missed dose.  Contact your doctor for further instructions.  Never double the dose.
