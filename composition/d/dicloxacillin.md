# Dicloxacillin
### Generic Name
Dicloxacillin

### Usage
Dicloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic used primarily to treat infections caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteria that are susceptible to penicillin.  This includes a range of infections, such as skin infections (including impetigo), and soft tissue infections.  While not its primary indication, dicloxacillin may also be used off-label in certain situations, such as treating some types of bone and joint infections or prosthetic joint infections caused by susceptible staphylococci.  Always consult a healthcare provider to determine if dicloxacillin is the right treatment for your specific infection.  It is crucial to note that dicloxacillin is ineffective against many other types of bacteria.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical adult dose is 125-250 mg every six hours.  However, dosages can vary significantly depending on the severity and location of the infection.  For more severe infections like skin and soft tissue infections, higher doses (500 mg every six hours) may be prescribed for 7-14 days.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage for children is calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) and typically divided into four doses per day (every six hours). The exact dosage will depend on the child's weight, the severity of the infection, and the doctor's assessment. Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Dosage Forms:** Dicloxacillin is usually available as oral capsules or tablets.

**Administration:**  It's generally recommended to take dicloxacillin on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after meals, with plenty of water.  Consistent, around-the-clock dosing may be necessary to maintain effective blood levels of the medication.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments for individuals with liver or kidney impairment are not always explicitly stated in prescribing information.  However, reducing the total dosage or adjusting the frequency may be considered for those with renal impairment. Your physician will determine the best approach based on your specific condition.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Gastrointestinal upset:  Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
*  Blood disorders (e.g., anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver problems (e.g., increased liver enzymes)
* Kidney problems (e.g., interstitial nephritis)
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dicloxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria, inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  This disruption ultimately leads to bacterial cell lysis (rupture and death).  Because it is penicillinase-resistant, it can overcome the effects of the enzyme penicillinase (beta-lactamase), which some bacteria produce to inactivate penicillin antibiotics.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Dicloxacillin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to penicillins or any component of the medication.  There's a risk of serious allergic reactions, including potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Dicloxacillin can interact with various medications, including aminoglycosides, macrolides, and oral contraceptives. Inform your doctor about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dicloxacillin is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning studies in animals haven't shown harm, but human studies are lacking.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with a history of allergies or asthma should use dicloxacillin cautiously.  Those with impaired renal or hepatic function may require dosage adjustments under medical supervision.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dicloxacillin with food?**  A:  It's generally recommended to take it on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: Improvement in symptoms usually starts within a few days, but the full course of treatment should be completed as prescribed, even if you feel better.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store dicloxacillin?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Is dicloxacillin effective against all bacterial infections?** A: No, it is primarily effective against *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteria that are susceptible to penicillin.  It will not treat viral or fungal infections.
