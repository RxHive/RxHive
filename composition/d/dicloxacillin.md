# Dicloxacillin

**Generic Name:** Dicloxacillin sodium

**Usage:** Dicloxacillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic used to treat infections caused by certain bacteria.  It's particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria, and is often prescribed for skin infections (like impetigo, cellulitis, and abscesses), pneumonia, and infections of the bones, joints, or respiratory tract.  It's commonly used when other penicillins are ineffective or unsuitable.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, dicloxacillin can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and heartburn.  These are often mild and may resolve on their own.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling (face, lips, tongue), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs).  Penicillin allergies are a serious concern; inform your doctor if you have any history of penicillin allergy.
* **Less common side effects:**  Headache, dizziness, fatigue, changes in liver function tests (rare), and pseudomembranous colitis (a serious intestinal infection caused by *Clostridium difficile*).

This is not an exhaustive list of side effects. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more complete information.

**How it Works:** Dicloxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycans, which are essential components of bacterial cell walls.  By inhibiting the formation of these cell walls, dicloxacillin prevents bacterial growth and ultimately leads to bacterial death.  It's important to note that it's only effective against bacteria; it does not work against viruses or other types of pathogens.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take dicloxacillin with food?**  Yes, taking dicloxacillin with food or milk can help reduce stomach upset.
* **How long do I need to take dicloxacillin?** The duration of treatment depends on the severity and type of infection.  Always complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you start to feel better.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking dicloxacillin?**  While there's no direct interaction, alcohol can sometimes worsen gastrointestinal side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking dicloxacillin.
* **Can I take other medications with dicloxacillin?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.  Some medications can interact with dicloxacillin.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Allergic reactions can range from mild (rash, itching) to severe (anaphylaxis).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or hives.
