# Dolasetron
### Generic Name
Dolasetron

### Usage
Dolasetron is primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, specifically during initial and repeat cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.  Its main function is to block the action of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in triggering nausea and vomiting. While its primary use is in the context of chemotherapy, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other areas where nausea and vomiting are significant symptoms.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (prevention):**  The dosage depends on the emetogenic potential of the chemotherapy regimen.  For moderately emetogenic regimens, the typical oral dose is 100 mg given within one hour before chemotherapy. For highly emetogenic regimens (often including cisplatin or anthracyclines with cyclophosphamide), 100 mg is typically given on the day(s) of chemotherapy.  This is usually part of a multi-drug antiemetic regimen, often including dexamethasone, an NK1 receptor antagonist, and potentially other agents like olanzapine.  For low-emetogenic regimens, a single 100 mg dose might suffice.  Precise dosing and regimen are determined by the oncologist based on the specific chemotherapy used and individual patient factors.

**Children:**

* **Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (prevention):** For children aged 2 years and older, but less than 17, the oral dose is 1.8 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 100 mg, administered within one hour before chemotherapy. Adolescents aged 17 and older receive the adult dose of 100 mg.  Pediatric dosing should always be determined and supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in treating children receiving chemotherapy.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is usually necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. For those with renal (kidney) impairment, dosage adjustment is not typically required, but electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended due to the potential for cardiac effects.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, but warranting attention):**

* Cardiovascular issues: Bradycardia (slow heart rate), tachycardia (fast heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), edema (swelling), arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), QT prolongation (potentially leading to serious heart rhythm disturbances).
* Gastrointestinal problems: Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* Nervous system effects: Dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbances.
* Skin reactions: Rash, itching.
* Allergic reactions: In rare cases, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and to discuss any concerns.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works

Dolasetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of serotonin at the 5-HT3 receptors in the body.  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in triggering nausea and vomiting, both in the gut (peripheral) and in the brain (central, specifically at the chemoreceptor trigger zone). By blocking these receptors, dolasetron prevents serotonin from initiating the vomiting reflex, thus reducing or eliminating nausea and vomiting.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dolasetron is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to dolasetron or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Dolasetron can interact with other medications, particularly those that prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.  It may also interact with other serotonergic drugs, increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Warnings:**  Use caution in elderly patients, children, and patients with renal impairment due to the potential for increased risk of adverse effects, particularly cardiac effects.  ECG monitoring might be recommended in certain patient groups.  Dolasetron should be used cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The risk-benefit ratio should be carefully considered.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store dolasetron?** A: Store dolasetron as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking dolasetron?** A: Consult your doctor.  Alcohol can worsen nausea and may interact with other medications you're taking.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses; generally, do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can dolasetron cause drowsiness?** A: While drowsiness is not a common side effect, fatigue is possible. Avoid activities requiring alertness if you feel drowsy.
* **Q: How long does it take for dolasetron to work?** A:  The onset of action varies, but it's generally effective when taken as directed before chemotherapy.
* **Q: Is dolasetron safe for long-term use?** A: Dolasetron is typically used for a short duration in conjunction with chemotherapy cycles. Long-term use is generally not recommended; discuss any concerns with your physician.
