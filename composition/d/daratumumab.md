# Daratumumab

**Generic Name:** Daratumumab

**Usage:** Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat several types of multiple myeloma (a cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow) and certain types of amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis (a condition where abnormal proteins build up in organs).  It's often used in combination with other medications as part of a multiple myeloma treatment regimen. Specific uses may include:

* Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (in combination with other drugs)
* Relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (meaning the cancer has come back or stopped responding to treatment)
* AL amyloidosis

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, daratumumab can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Infusion-related reactions:** These can include fever, chills, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, headache, back pain, and rash. These reactions often occur during or shortly after the infusion and can be managed with pre-medication.
* **Infections:**  Daratumumab weakens the immune system, making you more susceptible to infections.
* **Low blood counts:** This can lead to anemia (low red blood cells), neutropenia (low white blood cells), and thrombocytopenia (low platelets).
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These can be managed with anti-nausea medications.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak.
* **Constipation**
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.
* **Cardiac events:**  In rare cases, more serious side effects such as heart problems can occur.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.  Serious side effects require immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:** Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called CD38, which is found on the surface of myeloma cells and some other cells. By binding to CD38, daratumumab triggers several mechanisms that help eliminate these cells, including:

* **Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC):** Daratumumab marks the myeloma cells for destruction by other immune cells.
* **Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC):** Daratumumab activates the complement system, a part of the immune system that helps destroy cells.
* **Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP):** Daratumumab facilitates the engulfment and destruction of myeloma cells by phagocytic cells.


**FAQs:**

* **How is daratumumab administered?** It's usually given intravenously (IV) over several hours.
* **How long is the treatment course?**  The duration of treatment varies depending on the type and stage of cancer, response to treatment, and overall health. It's determined by your oncologist.
* **What are the monitoring requirements?**  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor blood counts, kidney function, and other vital signs.
* **Can daratumumab be used in combination with other treatments?** Yes, it's often used in combination with other medications for multiple myeloma, such as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and other monoclonal antibodies.
* **Are there any precautions before taking daratumumab?**  Inform your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions, especially kidney problems or heart conditions.  You may need additional monitoring if you have these conditions.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
