# Daratumumab
### Generic Name
Daratumumab

### Usage

Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer affecting plasma cells in the bone marrow.  Its primary use is in combination with other medications or as monotherapy for both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  "Relapsed" means the myeloma has returned after a period of remission, and "refractory" means the myeloma has not responded to previous treatments.  While not its primary indication, it's also being investigated and used off-label in some cases of relapsed systemic light-chain amyloidosis, a condition where abnormal proteins deposit in organs.

### Dosage

Daratumumab is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage is determined based on the patient's actual body weight and the specific treatment regimen.  **It is crucial to note that the information below represents a summary; precise dosage and regimens should always be determined and overseen by a qualified healthcare professional.**  There is no pediatric dosage established.  Here are examples of common adult regimens:

* **Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma:** Dosage varies widely depending on the specific combination therapy used (e.g., D-VMP, DRd, DVTd), typically involving a loading phase of weekly doses followed by less frequent administrations (every 2, 3, or 4 weeks) until disease progression.  Dosage is usually 16 mg/kg.

* **Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma:**  Again, dosage and frequency depend on the regimen (monotherapy or combinations like DRd, DPd, DVd, or DKd), but generally follows a similar pattern to newly diagnosed regimens, usually at 16 mg/kg.  Regimens can vary widely depending on the specific drugs used in combination, response to treatment, and patient tolerance.


**Important Considerations:**  Premedication is usually given before each Daratumumab infusion to reduce the risk of infusion reactions. This often includes corticosteroids (like dexamethasone or methylprednisolone), acetaminophen, and antihistamines.  Post-infusion medications, such as corticosteroids, may also be prescribed.  Antiviral prophylaxis is often initiated to prevent herpes zoster reactivation.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (>10% incidence) may include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anemia
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Nasal congestion
* Fever
* Infusion reactions


Less common but serious side effects (<10% incidence) can include:  Hypertension, herpes zoster infection, and reactivation of Hepatitis B virus.  Rare but potentially life-threatening side effects include anaphylaxis and pancreatitis.


If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, immediate medical attention is essential.


### How it Works

Daratumumab is a targeted therapy. It's a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to CD38, a protein found on the surface of multiple myeloma cells.  This binding triggers several mechanisms that lead to the death of the myeloma cells:

* **Direct cell death (apoptosis):**  Binding of Daratumumab to CD38 directly induces the myeloma cells to undergo programmed cell death.
* **Immune system mediated cell death:** Daratumumab activates the immune system to attack and destroy the myeloma cells through complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Daratumumab is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the drug or its components.
* **Bone marrow suppression:** Daratumumab can suppress bone marrow function, potentially leading to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Regular blood counts are crucial to monitor this.
* **Infusion reactions:**  Serious infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur.  Careful monitoring and premedication are essential.
* **Hepatitis B reactivation:**  Daratumumab can reactivate Hepatitis B virus in patients who are carriers.  Screening for HBV infection before starting treatment is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and lactation:**  Daratumumab may harm a developing fetus.  Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for three months afterward.  The safety of Daratumumab during breastfeeding is unknown.


### FAQs

* **How is Daratumumab stored?** Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions; it is generally refrigerated.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The response to Daratumumab varies among patients. It's not a medication that provides immediate relief; effects generally manifest over time as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss the appropriate course of action.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage or schedule on your own.

* **Can I drive while taking Daratumumab?**  Fatigue is a common side effect. If you experience fatigue or other side effects affecting alertness, avoid driving or operating machinery.

* **Are there any interactions with other drugs?** Yes, there are potential interactions with other medications; thorough communication with your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking is paramount.
