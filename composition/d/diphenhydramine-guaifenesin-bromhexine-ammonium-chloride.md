# Diphenhydramine + Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Ammonium Chloride
### Generic Name
Diphenhydramine + Guaifenesin + Bromhexine + Ammonium Chloride


This combination is not typically found as a single, fixed-dose generic medication.  Instead, these four ingredients are often combined in various over-the-counter (OTC) formulations for the relief of cold and flu symptoms.  It's crucial to understand that the specific dosage ratios of these ingredients will vary depending on the brand and product.  Always refer to the product labeling for accurate information.


### Usage

This combination medication is used to treat symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  The individual components target different symptoms:

* **Diphenhydramine:** An antihistamine, it primarily works to reduce runny nose and sneezing.  It also has sedative effects, which can help with nighttime coughing and restlessness.

* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant, it helps thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.

* **Bromhexine:** Another expectorant, it works similarly to guaifenesin by loosening mucus, though it is thought to work at a different point in the mucus production process.


* **Ammonium Chloride:** Acts as an expectorant by altering the pH of respiratory secretions which leads to thinning of mucus and making it easier to cough up.

This combination aims to alleviate several symptoms simultaneously:  cough (productive and non-productive), runny nose, congestion, and sneezing.  It's important to note that this medication treats *symptoms*, not the underlying infection itself.


### Dosage

**Dosage information cannot be provided here.** The exact dosage for this combination will vary significantly based on the specific product formulation.  **Always follow the instructions printed on the product packaging carefully**. The dosage will depend on factors such as age, weight, and the severity of symptoms.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.  If you are uncertain about the appropriate dosage, consult a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Headache
* Constipation


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Difficulty urinating
* Confusion
* Hallucinations (especially in older adults or with higher doses)


If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

This medication works through the combined actions of its individual components as previously described.  Diphenhydramine blocks histamine receptors, reducing allergic symptoms. Guaifenesin and Bromhexine thin and loosen mucus, facilitating expectoration.  Ammonium Chloride alters the pH to help thin the mucus. The combined effect is a reduction in the severity of common cold and flu symptoms.
