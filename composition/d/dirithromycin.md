# Dirithromycin
### Generic Name
Dirithromycin

### Usage
Dirithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used primarily to treat various bacterial infections.  Its main applications include treating respiratory tract infections like acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and pharyngitis (strep throat) or tonsillitis. It's also effective against uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.  While not its primary use, it can be used to treat secondary bacterial infections in acute bronchitis.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**  The usual adult dose is 500 mg once daily (OD). The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection:

* **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis; uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections:** 5-7 days
* **Secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis:** 7 days
* **Community-acquired pneumonia:** 14 days
* **Pharyngitis or tonsillitis:** 10 days


**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):** Dirithromycin is generally not recommended for children under 12 years old because its safety and efficacy haven't been established in this age group. For children 12 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild impairment.  Use with caution in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary, but use with caution.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache

Less common, but more serious side effects include Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reactions).  If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Dirithromycin is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, erythromycylamine, after it's absorbed in the intestines.  Erythromycylamine works by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria. This interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from growing and multiplying, thus effectively combating the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dirithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to dirithromycin, erythromycin, or other macrolide antibiotics. It should also be avoided in patients who have developed liver disorders while taking dirithromycin previously.
* **Interactions:** Dirithromycin can interact with several other medications.  It may reduce the effectiveness of cholera and typhoid vaccines, and estrogens.  Concomitant use with pimozide is contraindicated.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment, kidney impairment, porphyria (a metabolic disorder), and breastfeeding women.  Dirithromycin may prolong the QT interval, potentially increasing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Dirithromycin is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use with caution during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dirithromycin with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting dirithromycin to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store dirithromycin?** A: Store dirithromycin as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  You may start feeling better within a few days, but it's essential to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed, even if you feel better sooner.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance.
