# Desoximetasone
### Generic Name
Desoximetasone

### Usage
Desoximetasone is a topical corticosteroid used to relieve the inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions.  Its primary use is for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (skin diseases that respond to corticosteroids).  This includes conditions like eczema, contact dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis.  It's also indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults 18 years and older.  Importantly, it's only for use on the skin and is not intended for internal use.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated, the age of the patient, and the formulation (cream, gel, ointment, or spray). Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses:**  A thin film of cream, gel, or ointment (0.05% or 0.25% strength) is typically applied to the affected area twice daily (BID), gently rubbing it in.
* **Plaque psoriasis:** A thin film of the 0.25% spray is applied BID to the affected area. Treatment should be stopped once the condition is under control, and treatment beyond 4 weeks is generally not recommended.  Do not use if skin atrophy is present.

**Children:**

* The safety and effectiveness of the spray formulation have not been established in children under 18 years of age.
* For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in children and adolescents, creams and gels (0.05% or 0.25%) may be used twice daily. Ointments (0.05% or 0.25%) can be used in children aged 10 years and older.  Always consult a pediatrician before using desoximetasone on a child.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, use should be cautious in these populations.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These are often mild and may not require medical attention.  However, if they persist or worsen, consult a doctor.

* Burning sensation
* Itching
* Erythema (redness)
* Skin irritation

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Skin atrophy (thinning of the skin)
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth)
* Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (reduced cortisol production)

* **Long-term or extensive use can lead to systemic absorption, resulting in effects such as Cushing's syndrome (characterized by weight gain, high blood pressure, and other hormonal imbalances).**

Always inform your doctor if you experience any side effects.


### How it Works
Desoximetasone is a topical corticosteroid with intermediate-to-high potency (depending on the formulation). It works by reducing inflammation and itching.  It stabilizes the membranes of leukocytes (white blood cells), preventing the release of substances that cause inflammation. It also inhibits the accumulation of macrophages (immune cells involved in inflammation), reduces capillary permeability (leakiness of blood vessels), and decreases the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine.  This multifaceted action leads to a decrease in swelling, redness, and itching.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Desoximetasone cream, gel, and ointment should not be used if you are allergic to desoximetasone or any components of the formulation. It should not be used on untreated bacterial, fungal, viral, or tubercular skin infections, including herpes simplex, vaccinia, and varicella. It should not be used in the eyes.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.  Extended use can suppress the HPA axis, leading to adrenal insufficiency.  Avoid prolonged use, large surface areas, and occlusive dressings.  Applying to areas like the face, axilla, or groin may increase absorption and risk of side effects.
* **Interactions:** Desoximetasone's interaction with other drugs, particularly aldesleukin (an anti-cancer medication), may diminish the effect of the other drug.  Combining these should be avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Desoximetasone is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential benefits may outweigh the risks in some cases, but use during pregnancy should only be considered after careful assessment of risks and benefits by a physician.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised. If used by a breastfeeding mother, avoid applying to the chest to prevent accidental ingestion by the infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The timeframe varies depending on the condition and severity, but improvement is usually seen within a few days to weeks.
* **Q: Can I use desoximetasone on my face?** A: While it's possible, it's generally not recommended due to the increased risk of side effects from absorption through thinner facial skin.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: Can I use desoximetasone with other topical medications?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  Using multiple topical medications simultaneously may increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: How should I store desoximetasone?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally ingest desoximetasone?** A: This is unlikely with topical applications, but if it happens, seek immediate medical attention.
