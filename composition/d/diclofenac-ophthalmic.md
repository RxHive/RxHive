# Diclofenac (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Diclofenac (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Diclofenac ophthalmic solution is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to temporarily relieve pain and photophobia (sensitivity to light) in patients undergoing corneal refractive surgery.  It's also used to treat postoperative inflammation following cataract extraction and to manage non-chronic post-traumatic inflammation in non-penetrating eye wounds.  Its primary use is in managing post-surgical inflammation of the eye, particularly after cataract surgery and refractive procedures.  Secondary uses include pain and photophobia relief related to eye surgery and managing inflammation from non-penetrating eye injuries.

### Dosage
**Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and surgical procedure.

* **Postoperative ocular inflammation (cataract surgery):**  0.1% solution:  One drop in the affected eye four times a day (QID), starting 24 hours after surgery and continuing for two weeks.  Alternatively, one drop up to five times in the three hours before surgery, one drop at 15, 30, and 45 minutes post-surgery, then one drop 3-5 times per day for up to four weeks.

* **Ocular pain/photophobia (corneal refractive surgery):** 0.1% solution: One to two drops in the affected eye within one hour before surgery, within 15 minutes after surgery, and then four times a day for up to three days.

* **Non-chronic post-traumatic ocular inflammation (non-penetrating wounds):** 0.1% solution: A wound culture should be performed before starting treatment. Then, one drop is instilled 4-5 times daily, depending on the severity of the inflammation.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of diclofenac ophthalmic in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment due to the minimal systemic absorption of the ophthalmic formulation. However, it's always prudent to consult a doctor for personalized advice.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Transient burning or stinging in the eyes
* Lacrimation (increased tear production)
* Eye redness
* Eye irritation

**Less Common, but More Serious Side Effects:**

* Increased intraocular pressure
* Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)
* Allergic reactions (conjunctivitis, rash, etc.)
* Corneal complications (e.g., ulceration, thinning, perforation)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Diclofenac ophthalmic solution works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking prostaglandin production, diclofenac reduces inflammation and pain in the eye.  It also has other proposed mechanisms involving effects on immune cells, further contributing to its anti-inflammatory action.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Diclofenac ophthalmic is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to diclofenac or any component of the formulation, and those with a history of hypersensitivity (e.g., asthma, urticaria, rhinitis) to aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* **Interactions:** It may interact with other ophthalmic medications, such as prostaglandins and corticosteroids. Consult a doctor before using diclofenac ophthalmic with other eye drops.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with a history of sensitivity to aspirin or other NSAIDs, those at risk for bleeding, those using medications that increase bleeding risk, those on concomitant topical steroids (increased risk of corneal complications), those with diabetes, those with complicated ocular surgeries or corneal problems, and those with rheumatoid arthritis. Avoid use late in pregnancy as it may affect fetal development.  It's unknown if it's excreted in breast milk.
* **General Considerations:** This medication is for ophthalmic use only. Avoid contact of the bottle tip with the eye or skin. Use a separate bottle for each eye if treating both. Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them. Wait at least 5 minutes before applying other eye drops.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store diclofenac ophthalmic?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I use diclofenac ophthalmic if I wear contact lenses?** A: Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I use diclofenac ophthalmic for any eye problem?** A: No, it is specifically for postoperative inflammation, pain and photophobia related to specific eye surgeries, and for non-chronic post-traumatic inflammation in non-penetrating eye wounds. Consult a doctor for other eye problems.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of using diclofenac ophthalmic?** A:  Long-term effects are generally not expected with short courses of treatment as prescribed.  However, prolonged use or use in inappropriate situations can carry risks. Consult a doctor if you have concerns.
