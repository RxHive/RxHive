# Duloxetine
### Generic Name
Duloxetine

### Usage

Duloxetine is a medication primarily used to treat several conditions affecting the nervous system.  Its main application is in managing major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's also approved for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults and children aged 7 and older.  Beyond these primary uses, duloxetine is effectively used to manage several types of chronic pain: diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults, fibromyalgia in adults and adolescents (13 years and older), and chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults.  It's important to note that while some healthcare providers may prescribe duloxetine off-label for other conditions such as stress urinary incontinence or chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, its efficacy and safety in these areas haven't been as extensively studied.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to the medication. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Major Depressive Disorder:** Typically starts at 60mg daily, but sometimes begins at 30mg daily for a week before increasing to 60mg. The maximum dose is 120mg daily, usually divided into two doses.
* **Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain:** Usually 60mg daily, which can be divided into two doses. The maximum dose is 60mg daily. Lower starting doses may be considered if needed.
* **Fibromyalgia and Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain:** Often starts with 30mg daily for a week before increasing to 60mg daily, depending on how well the patient tolerates it.
* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder:**  Starts at 60mg daily (in some cases, 30mg for a week then increased), maximum dose 120mg.  Older adults (over 65) may start with 30mg daily for two weeks before considering an increase.

**Children:**

Dosage in children is determined by the physician based on the child's age, weight, and specific condition. Generally, for generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia (in adolescents 13-17 years old), treatment might begin with 30mg daily, potentially increasing to 60mg daily.  Duloxetine is not typically used in very young children.

**Administration:** Duloxetine is usually taken orally as a capsule.  Some formulations may be available as delayed-release capsules, which should be swallowed whole.  Specific instructions from your doctor or pharmacist are crucial for correct administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) often include:

* Headache
* Drowsiness

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Increased blood pressure

If you experience any troubling side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Duloxetine belongs to a class of drugs called serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). It works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. These are neurotransmitters, chemicals that help nerve cells communicate with each other.  Low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine are associated with depression, anxiety, and certain types of pain. By increasing their levels, duloxetine helps alleviate these symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Duloxetine should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, those taking MAO inhibitors (certain antidepressants), or those with severe liver or kidney disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Duloxetine can interact with other medications, including other antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, certain pain relievers, and blood thinners.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Duloxetine is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects on the developing fetus aren't fully known.  It's excreted in breast milk. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking it during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults and Children:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for older adults and children. Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Suicidal Thoughts:**  There is an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in younger adults. Close monitoring is crucial.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking duloxetine suddenly?** A: No, it's important to gradually reduce the dose under your doctor's supervision to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking duloxetine?** A: It's generally advised to avoid alcohol as it can worsen side effects.
* **Q: How should I store duloxetine?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Does duloxetine cause weight gain or loss?** A:  Weight loss is more common, but weight gain can occur in some individuals.
