This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent.


**How it Works:**

Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).  This means it works by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain.  These are neurotransmitters, chemicals that transmit signals between nerve cells.  By increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters, duloxetine helps improve mood, reduce anxiety, and relieve pain.  The exact mechanism by which it treats stress urinary incontinence is not fully understood but is thought to involve its effect on norepinephrine.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I stop taking duloxetine suddenly?** No.  Stopping duloxetine abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always talk to your doctor before stopping or changing your dose.  They will help you gradually reduce your dose to minimize withdrawal effects.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking duloxetine?**  It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking duloxetine, as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.

* **Can duloxetine cause weight gain or loss?**  Both weight gain and weight loss are possible side effects.  The effect on weight varies from person to person.

* **Is duloxetine habit-forming?** Duloxetine is not considered a habit-forming drug in the same way as opioids or other substances. However, stopping abruptly after long-term use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
