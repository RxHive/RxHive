# Doxorubicin (Liposomal)
### Generic Name
Doxorubicin (Liposomal)

### Usage
Liposomal Doxorubicin is primarily used in the treatment of several cancers. Its main applications include:

* **AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma:** This is a cancer that causes lesions on the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. Liposomal Doxorubicin helps manage and control the growth of these lesions.
* **Multiple myeloma:** A cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow.  Liposomal Doxorubicin is often used in combination with other therapies to treat this condition.
* **Advanced ovarian cancer:**  This medication is used to treat ovarian cancer that has spread beyond the ovaries or has recurred after initial treatment.

While not its primary use, Liposomal Doxorubicin is also sometimes used off-label (meaning it's used for a condition not officially approved by regulatory bodies) in the treatment of other cancers including metastatic breast cancer, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma (salvage treatment), advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, and advanced or recurrent uterine sarcoma.  The effectiveness and safety in these off-label uses should be discussed with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Liposomal Doxorubicin dosages should not be directly substituted for conventional Doxorubicin on a milligram-per-milligram basis. Dosages are calculated based on body surface area (m²) and the specific cancer being treated.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or healthcare provider.

The following are examples of dosages used,  **but should not be considered a substitute for a doctor's prescription**:

* **AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma:**  Typically 20 mg/m² intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* **Advanced ovarian cancer:** Usually 50 mg/m² IV every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* **Multiple myeloma:**  This is typically administered in combination with bortezomib (another cancer medication). A common regimen involves 30 mg/m² IV on day 4 of a 3-week bortezomib cycle.
* **Other Cancers (Off-label use):** Dosage varies significantly depending on the cancer type, stage, and the patient's overall health.  Dosages for off-label uses are determined on a case-by-case basis by the oncologist. Examples include 50mg/m² every 4 weeks for metastatic breast cancer or  a range of doses in combination regimens for other cancers.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Liposomal Doxorubicin in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on factors such as liver function (reduced dose if bilirubin levels are elevated), toxicity (e.g., hand-foot syndrome, neutropenia), and other factors.  Your oncologist will monitor your condition closely and adjust the dose as needed.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Fatigue
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Hand-foot syndrome (pain and redness in the hands and feet)

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Cardiomyopathy (damage to the heart muscle)
* Infusion reactions (allergic-type reactions during administration)
*  Severe bone marrow suppression
* Second cancers

If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, it is crucial to contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Liposomal Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic.  The drug is encapsulated within liposomes (tiny fat bubbles) which helps protect it from breakdown in the body and allows for a more targeted delivery. Once inside the body, Doxorubicin inhibits the action of topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for DNA replication and repair.  By interfering with this enzyme, the drug prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing, ultimately leading to their death.  It also acts as an iron chelator, creating free radicals which further damage cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Liposomal Doxorubicin should not be used in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to Doxorubicin or any of its components, or those who are breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This drug may interact with other medications; inform your doctor of all the medications you're taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication falls into pregnancy category D (meaning it poses a risk to the fetus) and is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Cardiac Function:**  Liposomal Doxorubicin can cause damage to the heart.  Patients with pre-existing heart conditions require careful monitoring.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  This drug can significantly suppress bone marrow function leading to a decrease in blood cells. Regular blood tests are essential to monitor this.
* **Infusion Reactions:**  Infusion reactions can range from mild to severe, even life-threatening.  Close monitoring during administration is necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Liposomal Doxorubicin stored?** A:  Follow your pharmacist's instructions on storage carefully. It usually requires refrigeration.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see effects varies depending on the cancer being treated and the patient's response. It's crucial to follow your treatment plan and attend regular checkups.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Never adjust your dosage without consulting your doctor. Contact them immediately if you miss a scheduled dose.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects are possible, particularly cardiac toxicity.  Regular monitoring is vital to detect and manage any potential complications.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe side effects such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe allergic reaction.
