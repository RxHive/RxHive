# Danazol

**Generic Name:** Danazol

**Usage:**

Danazol is a synthetic steroid with androgenic and progestational properties.  Its primary use is in the treatment of:

* **Endometriosis:**  It reduces the size and growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, lessening pain and other symptoms associated with endometriosis.
* **Fibrocystic breast disease (Fibroadenomas):** While less common now due to other treatment options, it can be used to alleviate symptoms like breast pain and tenderness.
* **Hereditary angioedema (HAE):** Danazol can help prevent attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema, a rare disorder causing swelling in various body parts.


**Side Effects:**

Danazol can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common:** Weight gain, oily skin and acne, hair growth (hirsutism), voice changes (deepening), menstrual irregularities (amenorrhea or irregular bleeding), breast tenderness or enlargement, mood changes (depression, anxiety), headache, fatigue.
* **Serious:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), liver problems (jaundice, elevated liver enzymes), high blood pressure, increased risk of heart disease, changes in cholesterol levels, fluid retention, masculinization (in women), decreased libido.


**How it Works:**

Danazol works by suppressing the production of gonadotropins (hormones from the pituitary gland that stimulate the ovaries). This leads to a reduction in the production of estrogen and progesterone, hormones crucial for the growth of endometrial tissue.  The mechanism by which it reduces HAE attacks is less fully understood, but it's believed to involve an effect on the complement system.
