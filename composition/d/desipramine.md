# Desipramine
### Generic Name
Desipramine

### Usage
Desipramine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD).  It's a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), meaning it works differently than many newer antidepressants. While its primary use is for depression, desipramine is sometimes used off-label for other conditions, such as postherpetic neuralgia (nerve pain after shingles) and bulimia nervosa (an eating disorder).  However, it's crucial to understand that these off-label uses aren't as extensively studied or approved as its use for depression.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using desipramine for any condition.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  The starting dose for depression is typically 25-50 mg daily, taken in divided doses or once daily.  This dose is gradually increased based on individual tolerance and response, usually up to 100-200 mg per day.  In severe cases, higher doses (up to 300 mg/day) may be necessary.  For older adults, the starting dose should be lower (often 25 mg daily), and the maximum daily dose is generally lower (150 mg).  Dosages for off-label uses (postherpetic neuralgia and bulimia) vary and should be determined by a physician.

**Children and Adolescents:**  Desipramine is generally **not recommended** for children.  Its safety and effectiveness in this age group haven't been fully established. If a doctor deems it necessary for an adolescent, the starting dose is usually lower and carefully monitored.


**Administration:** Desipramine is typically administered orally as a tablet or capsule.  Taking it with food can help minimize gastrointestinal upset.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Blurred vision
* Weight changes
* Increased appetite
* Changes in blood pressure (both high and low)
* Changes in heart rate


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Seizures
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially in younger individuals)

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Desipramine primarily works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain.  These are neurotransmitters, chemicals that help nerve cells communicate with each other.  By blocking the reuptake of these neurotransmitters, desipramine increases their availability in the synapses (the gaps between nerve cells), potentially improving mood and reducing depressive symptoms. The exact mechanisms aren't completely understood, and it's believed that additional receptor effects also contribute to its antidepressant action.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Desipramine should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to it or other TCAs, narrow-angle glaucoma, or those currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or certain other medications that prolong the QT interval (a measure of heart rhythm). It should also be avoided during the acute recovery phase of a myocardial infarction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Desipramine can interact with many other medications, including MAOIs, some heart medications, and certain other antidepressants.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements) you are taking before starting desipramine.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of desipramine during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against the potential risks to both mother and child.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults are more susceptible to the side effects of desipramine, particularly cardiovascular effects. Lower doses are typically recommended, and careful monitoring is essential.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  There's an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in young adults taking antidepressants. Close monitoring is necessary, particularly in the initial stages of treatment and when doses are adjusted.  Patients and their families should be aware of this risk and seek immediate medical attention if such thoughts arise.


### FAQs

* **How long does it take to work?**  It typically takes several weeks for desipramine to achieve its full therapeutic effect.
* **Can I stop taking it suddenly?**  No.  Abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping desipramine.
* **How should I store it?**  Store desipramine at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking desipramine?**  No.  Alcohol can interact negatively with desipramine and worsen side effects.
* **What if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately to discuss any concerning side effects.
