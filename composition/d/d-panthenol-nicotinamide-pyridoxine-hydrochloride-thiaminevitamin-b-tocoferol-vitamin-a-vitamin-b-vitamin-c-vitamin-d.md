# D-Panthenol + Nicotinamide + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + ThiamineVitamin B + Tocoferol + Vitamin A + Vitamin B + Vitamin C + Vitamin D

It's impossible to provide detailed information about a generic formulation of D-Panthenol + Nicotinamide + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Thiamine + Tocoferol + Vitamin A + Vitamin B + Vitamin C + Vitamin D without knowing the specific concentrations of each ingredient.  The efficacy and side effects are highly dependent on the dosage.  This combination is a multivitamin and covers a broad range of vitamins, but providing specific details without knowing the dosage is irresponsible and potentially misleading.
