# Daclizumab

**Generic Name:** Daclizumab

**Usage:**

Daclizumab is a prescription medication used to prevent the rejection of transplanted kidneys in people who have received a kidney transplant.  Specifically, it's used in combination with other immunosuppressant medications to reduce the risk of organ rejection.  It's *not* used for other types of organ transplants. Note that while it *was* used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), this indication is no longer supported by the FDA due to safety concerns.


**Side Effects:**

Daclizumab, like other immunosuppressant drugs, carries a risk of serious side effects.  These can include:

* **Infections:** Increased susceptibility to infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) is a major risk.  These infections can range from mild to life-threatening.
* **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):**  This is a rare but potentially fatal brain infection caused by the JC virus.  It's a serious risk associated with immunosuppressant therapy.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  Abnormal liver function tests are possible.
* **Renal dysfunction (kidney problems):**  Existing kidney problems can be worsened.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions, including rash, itching, hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.
* **Other side effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dizziness, and high blood pressure are also possible.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary greatly among individuals.  It is crucial to report any unusual symptoms to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

Daclizumab is a monoclonal antibody. It works by binding to a protein on the surface of certain immune cells called CD25, which is found on activated T-cells. By binding to CD25, it prevents these T-cells from activating and attacking the transplanted kidney. This helps to reduce the body's immune response and prevents organ rejection.
