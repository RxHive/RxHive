# Daclizumab
### Generic Name
Daclizumab

### Usage

Daclizumab is a prescription medication used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults.  It's typically reserved for individuals who haven't responded adequately to two or more other MS treatments.  The medication works by targeting a specific part of the immune system, helping to reduce the frequency and severity of MS relapses.  It does not cure MS but aims to manage the disease's progression.  It's important to note that daclizumab is not indicated for the treatment of MS in children.

### Dosage

Daclizumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as a 150 mg injection once monthly.  The medication comes in a pre-filled syringe.  It's crucial to follow the healthcare provider's instructions precisely.  There are no specific dosage adjustments recommended for renal impairment. However, the medication is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hepatic disease, pre-existing hepatic impairment, or a history of autoimmune hepatitis.  Dosage adjustments or treatment interruption may be necessary based on liver function tests (LFTs).  Always consult your doctor before adjusting the dosage or frequency.  The safety and effectiveness of daclizumab in children under 17 have not been established, and its use is not recommended in this age group due to the increased risk of liver injury and immune-mediated disorders.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (>10%) may include:

* Skin rash or allergic skin reactions
* Infections (upper respiratory tract infections are common)
* Autoimmune disorders

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (1-10% or less frequent) include:

* Depression and suicidal thoughts
* Liver injury (hepatotoxicity), including autoimmune hepatitis (a serious condition)
* Immune-mediated disorders (various types)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious or unusual ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. It works by blocking interleukin-2 (IL-2), a protein that plays a crucial role in activating certain immune cells. By inhibiting IL-2, daclizumab helps modulate the immune response, reducing the inflammation and damage to the nervous system characteristic of MS. The exact mechanism of how this translates to therapeutic effects in MS is not fully understood.

### Precautions

* **Hepatotoxicity:**  Daclizumab can cause severe liver injury, including autoimmune hepatitis, even after treatment ends.  Liver function tests (LFTs) are required before, during, and after treatment.  Pre-existing liver disease is a contraindication.
* **Immune-mediated disorders:** Daclizumab can increase the risk of various immune-mediated disorders, affecting organs like the skin, liver, and intestines.
* **Contraindications:** Daclizumab is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, pre-existing liver disease, and those with a history of autoimmune hepatitis.
* **Interactions:** Daclizumab can interact with other medications, particularly other immunosuppressants.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Live vaccines should be avoided during and for a period after daclizumab treatment.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Daclizumab is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  The decision to breastfeed while on daclizumab should be made in consultation with a doctor.
* **Depression and Suicide:**  Daclizumab may increase the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts.  Close monitoring for mental health changes is essential.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking daclizumab?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.  Excessive alcohol use can have potential interactions with certain medications, and it can affect liver health.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you notice any adverse effects, particularly serious or unusual ones.
