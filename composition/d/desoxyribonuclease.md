# Desoxyribonuclease
### Generic Name
Desoxyribonuclease

### Usage
Desoxyribonuclease is a proteolytic enzyme used topically to treat various conditions involving necrotic tissue and exudates.  Its primary use is in wound care, specifically for cleaning and promoting healing of ulcers and other wounds characterized by excessive debris and pus.  A secondary use is in the treatment of mild vaginitis and cervicitis, where it helps to clear away viscous secretions.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition and route of administration.  There's no standardized dosage across all applications. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or the product labeling.

**Wound Dressing for Ulcers (Topical):**
* One vial of powder is mixed with 10-50 mL of saline.
* The solution is applied to the wound and allowed to remain in contact for 6-8 hours.
* This process may be repeated 3-4 times daily.


**Vaginitis and Cervicitis (Intravaginal):**
* **Ointment:** A 30g vaginal ointment is applied deep into the vagina at bedtime for 5 consecutive nights.
* **Solution (Severe Cases):** 10 mL of solution is administered intravaginally for 1-2 minutes, allowing it to disperse before inserting a cotton tampon.

**Important Note:**  The specific dosage and method of application should always be determined and supervised by a healthcare professional.  Improper use can lead to complications.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Local irritation or burning at the application site.
* Mild allergic reactions (rash, itching).

Serious side effects are rare but can occur.  If you experience any severe reactions, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or a severe allergic reaction, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Desoxyribonuclease works by breaking down deoxyribonucleoprotein and DNA found in necrotic (dead) tissue and exudates (pus-like fluid). This enzymatic action helps to liquefy the thick, viscous material, cleaning the wound surface and creating a more favorable environment for healing. By removing this debris, it also indirectly supports the action of antibodies and leukocytes, further promoting the healing process. When used with fibrinolysin, its effects are enhanced.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Desoxyribonuclease is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to bovine materials (as it's often derived from bovine sources) or hypersensitivity to mercury compounds, including thimerosal (a preservative sometimes found in formulations).
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in hematomas (blood clots) associated with neurosurgery.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of desoxyribonuclease during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  It should be used cautiously in these populations only when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor before use.
* **Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications are not widely documented, but it is advisable to inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.

### FAQs
* **Q: How should I store desoxyribonuclease?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the specific formulation. Always refer to the product label for precise guidelines. Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I use desoxyribonuclease on all types of wounds?** A: No.  It is primarily indicated for wounds with significant necrotic tissue and exudates. It's not suitable for all types of wounds. Consult a healthcare professional to determine its appropriateness for your specific wound.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects, like local irritation, usually resolve spontaneously. If you experience more severe or persistent side effects, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: Is desoxyribonuclease an antibiotic?** A: No, desoxyribonuclease is not an antibiotic. It works by cleaning the wound bed to facilitate healing, not by killing bacteria.  Antibiotics may still be necessary to treat any underlying infections.
