# Doxazosin
### Generic Name
Doxazosin

### Usage
Doxazosin is primarily used to treat two conditions:

1. **Mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure):**  It helps to lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.  It's often used in conjunction with other medications or as an alternative treatment option.

2. **Symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH):**  BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland that can cause urinary problems. Doxazosin relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder, improving urinary flow and reducing symptoms like frequent urination, weak urine stream, and nighttime urination.  It's crucial to rule out prostate cancer before starting treatment with Doxazosin, as the symptoms can overlap.  Note that Doxazosin doesn't treat the underlying cause of BPH, but it effectively manages its symptoms.

There are also off-label uses of Doxazosin, such as assisting in the expulsion of distal ureteral stones (smaller kidney stones) and in treating hypertension in children and adolescents. However, these uses lack robust clinical evidence and require careful consideration by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release), and the individual's response.  **Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and instructions.**

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension (Immediate-release):**  Typically starts at 1 mg once daily (OD), gradually increased by doubling the dose at intervals of 1-2 weeks, up to a maximum of 16 mg/day.
* **Hypertension (Extended-release):** Typically starts at 4 mg OD for 4 weeks, then adjusted as needed up to a maximum of 8 mg/day.
* **BPH (Immediate-release):** Usually begins at 1 mg OD, increasing to a maximum of 8 mg/day in 1-2 week intervals.
* **BPH (Extended-release):**  Starts at 4 mg OD for 4 weeks, then adjusted as needed up to a maximum of 8 mg/day.

**Children and Adolescents:** Doxazosin use in this population is off-label, with limited safety and efficacy data.  Dosage should be determined by a physician, generally starting at a lower dose (e.g., 1 mg/day) and carefully monitored.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. Severe hepatic impairment generally necessitates avoiding Doxazosin. Renal (kidney) impairment usually doesn't require dosage adjustments, but close monitoring is advisable.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Fatigue
* Headache

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (affecting 1-10% or less, but warrant immediate medical attention):**

* Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Edema (swelling)
* Nausea
* Sexual dysfunction
* Priapism (prolonged, painful erection)

This is not an exhaustive list.  Other side effects are possible.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Doxazosin is an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the effects of norepinephrine (a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict).  By blocking these receptors, Doxazosin relaxes blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.  In the case of BPH, it also relaxes muscles in the prostate and bladder, improving urinary flow.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Doxazosin is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to Doxazosin or other similar medications (prazosin, terazosin). It's also contraindicated in those with certain types of galactose intolerance.
* **Interactions:** Doxazosin can interact with several other medications, including other antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and others.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Doxazosin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are unknown.  Alternative medications are generally preferred for managing hypertension during pregnancy.  Doxazosin is excreted in breast milk, requiring careful consideration if breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  Older adults and those with heart conditions or hepatic impairment require careful monitoring when using Doxazosin due to an increased risk of orthostatic hypotension.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Doxazosin?** A:  It's generally recommended to limit alcohol consumption while taking Doxazosin due to the increased risk of hypotension.
* **Q: How should I store Doxazosin?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Doxazosin suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Doxazosin can lead to a rebound effect, potentially causing a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor should gradually reduce the dosage before completely discontinuing the medication.
* **Q:  What are the early signs of an allergic reaction to Doxazosin?** A: Look out for skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
