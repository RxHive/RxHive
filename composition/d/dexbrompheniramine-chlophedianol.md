### How it Works

Dexbrompheniramine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Chlophedianol is a cough suppressant that acts on the brain to reduce the cough reflex.  Together, they address multiple symptoms associated with the common cold and allergies.
