# Dasatinib

**Generic Name:** Dasatinib

**Usage:** Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used to treat certain types of adult chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL).  Specifically:

* **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML):** It's used as a first-line treatment in some patients and as a second-line treatment for those who have not responded well to or cannot tolerate imatinib (Gleevec).  It may also be used for patients in the chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis of CML.
* **Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ ALL):** It's used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to treat this type of leukemia.

**Side Effects:** Dasatinib, like other TKIs, can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare.  The severity can vary greatly among individuals. Common side effects include:

* **Fluid retention (edema):** Swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Gastrointestinal upset.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Muscle aches and pains (myalgia):** Muscle soreness.
* **Headaches:** Pain in the head.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation.
* **Pleural effusion:** Fluid buildup around the lungs.
* **Increased risk of bleeding:** Bruising or bleeding more easily.
* **Liver problems:** Elevated liver enzymes.


**More serious, but less common side effects include:**

* **Heart problems:** Including fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion), and heart failure.
* **Severe liver damage:** Hepatitis.
* **Severe skin reactions:** Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
* **Lung problems:** Including interstitial lung disease.
* **Kidney problems:** Renal impairment.
* **Second cancers:** Increased risk of developing other cancers over time.


**How it Works:** Dasatinib works by blocking the activity of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enzyme.  This enzyme is abnormally active in CML and Ph+ ALL and drives the uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells. By inhibiting this enzyme, dasatinib helps slow or stop the growth and spread of these cancer cells.
