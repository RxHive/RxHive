# Dasatinib
### Generic Name
Dasatinib

### Usage

Dasatinib is a medication primarily used to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).  It's effective in various stages of CML, including chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis.  Dasatinib is also used for patients who have developed resistance to or intolerance of other CML treatments like imatinib.  Furthermore, it's indicated in the treatment of Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), both in adults who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other therapies, and in newly diagnosed pediatric patients (in combination with chemotherapy).  While not explicitly labeled for this purpose, Dasatinib has also been used off-label in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

### Dosage

Dasatinib dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  Always follow the prescription and guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Adults:**

* **Newly diagnosed chronic-phase Ph+ CML:**  The usual starting dose is 100 mg once daily (OD).  A dose increase to 140 mg OD may be considered if the patient doesn't show an adequate hematologic or cytogenetic response.
* **Ph+ CML (resistant or intolerant to prior therapy):** The starting dose is typically 100 mg OD, with potential escalation to 140 mg OD if needed.  For accelerated or blast phase CML, the usual starting dose is 140 mg OD, potentially increasing to 180 mg OD if the initial dose is ineffective.
* **Ph+ ALL (resistant or intolerant to prior therapy):**  Usually starts at 140 mg OD, with potential escalation to 180 mg OD.
* **Off-label GIST:** A common off-label dosage is 70 mg twice daily (BID).


**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children with Ph+ CML or ALL is weight-based and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  For example, a child weighing 10-20 kg might start with 40 mg OD, while a child weighing over 45 kg may start with 100 mg OD.  Dosages are adjusted based on body weight and response.  In newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, Dasatinib is typically used in combination with chemotherapy, and dose escalation isn't recommended.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Specific adjustments are determined by a physician based on the patient's individual clinical picture and laboratory results.  Dose reductions or temporary treatment interruptions may also be necessary due to side effects.


### Side Effects

Dasatinib, like many cancer therapies, can cause various side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in at least 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Pain
* Facial edema
* Peripheral edema
* Diarrhea

* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Fluid retention
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Anemia
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Pulmonary arterial hypertension
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
* Serious bleeding
* Cardiac problems (arrhythmias, heart failure)
* Liver damage
* Bone marrow suppression


**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that play a vital role in cell signaling and growth.  In CML and ALL, the abnormal BCR-ABL protein, a tyrosine kinase, drives the uncontrolled growth of leukemia cells. Dasatinib works by binding to and inhibiting the activity of BCR-ABL, thus slowing or stopping the proliferation of these cancerous cells.  It also inhibits other tyrosine kinases, such as those in the SRC family, which may contribute to its effectiveness.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dasatinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in breastfeeding women.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Dasatinib's metabolism can be affected by certain medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (which can increase Dasatinib levels) and inducers (which can decrease levels) should be used cautiously, if at all.  Gastric acid-reducing agents may also decrease Dasatinib absorption.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Dasatinib is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it can cause fetal harm.  Effective contraception is essential during treatment and for 30 days afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during and for two weeks after treatment.
* **Other Precautions:** Dasatinib can increase the risk of bone marrow suppression, cardiac events, QT prolongation, severe skin reactions, pulmonary arterial hypertension, fluid retention, and bleeding.  Regular monitoring is crucial.  Patients with pre-existing heart conditions, liver or kidney problems, or a history of bleeding disorders should be closely monitored.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Dasatinib with food?** A:  Dasatinib can be taken with or without food, but taking it with food may help reduce gastrointestinal upset.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: How should I store Dasatinib?** A: Store Dasatinib as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Dasatinib?** A:  No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, as they may increase Dasatinib blood levels and increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: How long will I need to take Dasatinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your specific condition, response to treatment, and your doctor's recommendations.  It can range from months to years.
