# Dolutegravir
### Generic Name
Dolutegravir

### Usage
Dolutegravir is an antiretroviral medication specifically classified as an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  Its primary use is in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It's crucial to understand that dolutegravir is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral agents; it is never administered as a monotherapy.  This combination approach is essential for effective HIV management and to minimize the development of drug resistance. Dolutegravir is used in both treatment-naive (patients never previously treated for HIV) and treatment-experienced (patients who have received prior HIV therapy) individuals.  The specific combination of drugs will vary depending on individual patient factors, including resistance testing results and other health conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The standard adult dose is 50 mg once daily (OD). However, this can be adjusted based on several factors:

* **Co-administration with certain drugs:**  If dolutegravir is given concurrently with medications like carbamazepine, efavirenz, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, tipranavir/ritonavir, or rifampin, the dose increases to 50 mg twice daily (BID).
* **INSTI-experienced patients:** For patients who have previously used INSTIs and have certain resistance mutations or suspected INSTI resistance, a 50 mg BID dose is also recommended.
* **Switching regimens:** For patients already virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) who are switching to a regimen including dolutegravir and rilpivirine, a 50 mg OD dose is appropriate.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is weight-based and differs between the tablet and soluble tablet for oral suspension formulations.  These are *not* interchangeable on a milligram-for-milligram basis.  Consult prescribing information for precise dosing based on weight and formulation. Generally, lower doses are used for younger children and adolescents, with dose escalation as weight increases.  Dosage may also differ depending on previous INSTI use and resistance.  Precise instructions for pediatric use should be obtained from a healthcare provider.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary in cases of hepatic or renal impairment.  For mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, no adjustment is usually needed.  However, dolutegravir use is generally not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Similarly, for mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment in treatment-naive or INSTI-naive patients, adjustments aren't typically required.  In INSTI-experienced individuals with severe renal impairment, caution is advised, and careful monitoring is essential.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Increased serum lipase levels
* Pruritus (itching)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence)
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Depression

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including acute hepatic failure
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
* Suicidal ideation or tendencies
* Myositis (muscle inflammation)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Weight gain


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.

### How it Works
Dolutegravir works by inhibiting the HIV integrase enzyme.  Integrase is crucial for HIV replication because it integrates the virus's genetic material into the host cell's DNA. By blocking this integration process, dolutegravir prevents the virus from replicating and spreading.  This action, in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, helps to suppress the HIV viral load and improve the CD4+ T-cell count (a key indicator of immune system health).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Dolutegravir is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components. It's also contraindicated with concomitant use of dofetilide.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Dolutegravir can interact with other medications.  Healthcare providers should be informed of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) a patient is taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Dolutegravir is a Category B drug in pregnancy. While generally considered a preferred INSTI during pregnancy, it's associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects.  Benefits and risks should be carefully weighed.  The drug is excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding may need to be discontinued during treatment.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, with dosage adjustments potentially needed, as described above.
* **Geriatric Patients:**  Use in older adults requires careful monitoring due to potential increased sensitivity to adverse effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dolutegravir with food?** A:  Dolutegravir can be taken without regard to meals, but administration should be timed appropriately in relation to antacids, sucralfate, or supplements containing calcium or iron to avoid interaction.
* **Q: How long will I need to take dolutegravir?** A:  Dolutegravir is usually a lifelong treatment for HIV.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.  Consult your healthcare provider for further guidance.
* **Q: How is dolutegravir stored?** A: Store dolutegravir as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I stop taking dolutegravir if I feel better?** A: No, discontinuing treatment prematurely can lead to the development of drug resistance and disease progression. Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions.
