# Dolutegravir

**Generic Name:** Dolutegravir

**Usage:** Dolutegravir is an antiretroviral medication used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It's typically part of a combination therapy regimen, meaning it's used with other antiretroviral drugs.  It's used in adults, adolescents, and children (with weight and age restrictions)  to:

* Suppress HIV replication, thereby reducing the viral load in the body.
* Improve CD4+ T-cell counts (a type of white blood cell crucial for a healthy immune system).
* Reduce the risk of HIV transmission.
* As part of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in some specific circumstances (though other drugs are typically preferred for PrEP).


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, rash, insomnia, dizziness.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased liver enzymes (hepatitis), allergic reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe skin reaction), depression, suicidal thoughts, kidney problems, pancreatitis.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Neurological side effects such as seizures, ataxia (lack of muscle control), and encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), particularly in individuals with pre-existing neurological conditions.


**How it Works:** Dolutegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  It works by blocking the activity of the HIV integrase enzyme.  Integrase is essential for HIV to insert its genetic material into the DNA of human cells, a crucial step in the virus's replication cycle. By inhibiting integrase, dolutegravir prevents the virus from reproducing and spreading.


**FAQs:**

* **Is dolutegravir safe during pregnancy?**  It is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but a doctor should carefully monitor both mother and baby.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking dolutegravir?**  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally not contraindicated, but excessive alcohol use can negatively impact liver health, which should be monitored since dolutegravir can affect liver enzymes.
* **Can I take dolutegravir with other medications?**  Potential drug interactions exist. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications can affect dolutegravir's effectiveness, or vice versa.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.  Consistency in taking medication is vital for optimal HIV management.
* **How long will I need to take dolutegravir?**  HIV treatment is typically lifelong.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to the virus rebounding and becoming more resistant to medication.
