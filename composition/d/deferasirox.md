# Deferasirox
### Generic Name
Deferasirox

### Usage

Deferasirox is primarily used to treat chronic iron overload.  This condition occurs when the body accumulates too much iron, often due to repeated blood transfusions (transfusional iron overload) or conditions like thalassemia (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia syndromes).  The excess iron can damage vital organs like the liver, heart, and pancreas. Deferasirox helps remove this excess iron from the body.


### Dosage

Deferasirox dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's weight, age, the cause of iron overload, and their response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  Dosages are typically expressed in milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day).  The medication comes in several forms: tablets for suspension, oral tablets, and sprinkle granules.

**Adults:**

* **Transfusional iron overload:** Initial doses vary widely depending on the formulation used (tablets for suspension vs. oral tablets/granules).  Maintenance dosage is adjusted every 3-6 months based on serum ferritin levels (a marker of iron stores) and the patient's response.  The goal is to reduce serum ferritin to safe levels, usually below 500 mcg/L and maintain these levels.  Maximum doses are usually limited to avoid adverse effects.

* **Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia:**  Similar to transfusional overload, initial and maintenance doses depend on the formulation and are adjusted based on serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron concentration (iron levels in the liver).  Regular monitoring of liver iron concentration via liver biopsy or other approved methods is vital.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is generally calculated based on weight, similar to adults, but is usually initiated at a lower dose. Deferasirox is generally not used for children under 2 (or 10 depending on the specific indication) years old, unless in special circumstances and under strict medical supervision.  Specific dosage adjustments may be needed based on age and condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are frequently necessary due to potential side effects.  Significant adjustments might be required for patients with liver or kidney problems. These adjustments will be carefully determined by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Deferasirox can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  The frequency and severity of these side effects vary greatly amongst individuals.

**Common side effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Headache
* Dizziness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Liver damage (increased liver enzymes)
* Kidney damage (increased creatinine levels, acute kidney injury)
* Hearing loss
* Vision problems
* Bone marrow suppression (low blood cell counts)
* Serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Deferasirox is an iron chelator. This means it binds to iron in the body, forming a complex that can be excreted in the stool.  By removing excess iron, it helps prevent the damage caused by iron overload to vital organs.


### Precautions

* **Kidney disease:** Deferasirox can harm the kidneys.  Regular kidney function tests are essential, particularly for people with pre-existing kidney problems. Use is contraindicated in those with severe kidney impairment.
* **Liver disease:** Deferasirox can also affect the liver. Regular liver function tests are necessary.  It should generally be avoided in individuals with severe liver disease.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Deferasirox is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning it may be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Whether to use it during breastfeeding should be determined by a physician considering the risk-benefit balance for the mother and child.
* **Drug interactions:** Deferasirox can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by certain liver enzymes. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your healthcare provider before starting Deferasirox.
* **Other precautions:**  Regular monitoring of blood counts is important due to the risk of bone marrow suppression.  Patients should be aware of potential hearing and vision changes.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long do I need to take Deferasirox?** A: The duration of treatment depends on individual response and the severity of iron overload.  It may be long-term and monitored closely by a physician.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Deferasirox suddenly?** A: No, always consult your doctor before stopping Deferasirox.  Stopping suddenly may be harmful.
* **Q: How should I store Deferasirox?** A: Store it according to the label instructions, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I take Deferasirox with food?** A: Some formulations are best taken on an empty stomach or with a light meal.  Follow your healthcare provider's and the medication's label instructions precisely.
* **Q: Are there other iron chelation therapies?** A: Yes, other medications are available for iron chelation; your doctor will help choose the most appropriate treatment for you.
