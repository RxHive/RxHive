# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride
### Generic Name
Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Guaifenesin + Ammonium Chloride


### Usage

This combination medication is a multi-symptom cold and cough remedy.  It's primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold, the flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Each ingredient targets a specific symptom:

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.  It works on the cough center in the brain.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies and colds. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.

* **Ammonium Chloride:**  This acts as an expectorant, assisting in the removal of mucus from the respiratory tract.  It works by increasing the amount of fluid in the respiratory tract, thus thinning the mucus.


This combination medicine is intended to provide relief from multiple cold and flu symptoms simultaneously.  It's important to note that this medication only treats *symptoms* and doesn't cure the underlying infection.
