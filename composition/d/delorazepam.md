# Delorazepam
### Generic Name
Delorazepam

### Usage
Delorazepam is a benzodiazepine primarily used to treat insomnia (difficulty sleeping).  It helps induce sleep and improve sleep quality.  It's also used as a premedication before medical procedures, helping to reduce anxiety and induce sedation.  This premedication use is particularly common before diagnostic endoscopy, endoscopic surgery, and other surgical procedures.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the reason for use and the route of administration.  Always follow your doctor's prescription precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Insomnia (oral):** 0.5-2 mg once daily at bedtime.
* **Premedication (intramuscular - IM):** Dosages depend on the specific procedure.  Examples include 2 mg for diagnostic endoscopy one hour prior, 5 mg for endoscopic surgery one hour prior, and 0.5-2 mg for surgical premedication one hour prior.
* **Premedication (intravenous - IV):** Dosages depend on the specific procedure and are weight-based.  Examples include 0.02 mg/kg infused slowly over 3-5 minutes ten minutes before diagnostic endoscopy or 0.05 mg/kg for endoscopic surgery, also infused slowly over 3-5 minutes ten minutes before the procedure.  Surgical premedication IV doses are typically 0.02-0.05 mg/kg.


**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of delorazepam have not been established in children.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Caution is advised for individuals with liver disease.  Lower doses (0.25-0.5 mg orally) may be necessary for those with moderate-to-severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Delorazepam clearance is reduced in patients with renal insufficiency.  Specific dose recommendations for renal impairment are not available, and caution is advised.
* **Geriatric Patients:**  Elderly individuals often have a slower elimination rate of delorazepam.  Dosage adjustments may be required.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Weakness
* Dizziness
* Vertigo
* Fatigue
* Confusion
* Difficulty concentrating
* Tremor
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Nervousness
* Agitation
* Transient memory impairment
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Respiratory depression (slowed breathing)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Diplopia (double vision)
* Rash
* Hypothermia (low body temperature)
* Sexual dysfunction
* Urinary incontinence

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include severe respiratory depression.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  Always consult your healthcare provider if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works
Delorazepam is a benzodiazepine that works by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve activity, promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety. By increasing GABA's effect, delorazepam reduces brain activity, leading to sedation, reduced anxiety, and improved sleep.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Delorazepam is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, myasthenia gravis, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sleep apnea, and during pregnancy.
* **Interactions:**  Concomitant use with alcohol or other CNS depressants (e.g., hypnotics, opioid analgesics) is contraindicated due to additive effects.  It also interacts with sodium oxybate, increasing the effects of both drugs.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and when co-administered with other CNS depressants.  There is an increased risk of anterograde amnesia (loss of memory of events after taking the drug) and paradoxical reactions (opposite effects to those intended).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Delorazepam is contraindicated during pregnancy and is excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding inadvisable.
* **Withdrawal:** Abrupt withdrawal should be avoided as it can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Dosage should be tapered down under medical supervision.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for Delorazepam to work?**  A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration.  Oral administration takes longer than intravenous or intramuscular administration.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Delorazepam?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided completely while taking Delorazepam due to the risk of additive CNS depression.

* **Q: How long can I take Delorazepam?** A:  Delorazepam is generally not intended for long-term use (beyond 2-4 weeks), unless it's used only occasionally on an as-needed basis.  Discuss long-term use with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Delorazepam?** A: No, as it can cause drowsiness and impaired coordination. Avoid activities requiring mental alertness and motor coordination while taking this medication.

* **Q: How should I store Delorazepam?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  Keep out of the reach of children.
