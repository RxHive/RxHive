# Dexmethylphenidate
### Generic Name
Dexmethylphenidate

### Usage
Dexmethylphenidate is primarily used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  It's a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that helps improve focus, attention, and reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity associated with ADHD.  While not a primary indication, it may be considered off-label for other conditions in some cases, but this should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage is highly individualized and should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the patient's response and needs.  The information below is for general understanding and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults (ADHD):**

* **Immediate-release:** The usual starting dose is 2.5 mg twice daily (BID).  The dose can be increased gradually, in increments of 2.5-5 mg per week, up to a maximum of 20 mg per day.
* **Extended-release:** The usual starting dose is 10 mg once daily (OD). The dose can be increased gradually, in increments of 10 mg per week, up to a maximum of 40 mg per day.
* **Conversion from other medications:**  Converting from other stimulants like methylphenidate requires careful dose adjustment under the guidance of a doctor.

**Children aged 6 years and older (ADHD):**

The dosage is the same as for adults, but the starting dose may be lower and adjustments made more cautiously, based on the child's weight and response.  Again, this is strictly under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Adjustments may be needed based on individual response.  The manufacturer does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment, however, a healthcare provider may recommend adjustments in these cases based on the individual's health and response to the medication.

**Administration:** Immediate-release tablets can be taken with or without food. Extended-release capsules should be swallowed whole and not crushed, chewed, or broken.  Specific instructions will be provided by the prescribing physician or pharmacist.

### How it Works

Dexmethylphenidate is a stimulant that primarily affects the brain.  It works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that play a crucial role in attention, focus, and motor control.  By increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain's synapses, it helps improve cognitive function and reduce symptoms of ADHD.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Dexmethylphenidate should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other components of the formulation, or within 14 days of stopping a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). It is also contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, a known history of Tourette syndrome, motor tics, or significant anxiety.
* **Drug Interactions:**  It can interact with numerous medications, particularly MAOIs, antidepressants, blood pressure medications, and other CNS stimulants.  Always inform your doctor of all other medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Dexmethylphenidate is classified as Pregnancy Category C. The risk to the fetus is not fully known. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  Children, older adults, and patients with certain medical conditions (e.g., heart conditions, high blood pressure, pre-existing psychiatric disorders) may require closer monitoring and dosage adjustments.
* **Potential for Abuse and Dependence:**  Dexmethylphenidate is a controlled substance with a potential for abuse and dependence.  It is essential to follow the prescribed dosage and avoid misuse.
