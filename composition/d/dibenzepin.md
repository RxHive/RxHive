# Dibenzepin
### Generic Name
Dibenzepin

### Usage
Dibenzepin is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily used to treat depression.  While its main application is in managing depressive symptoms, it's crucial to remember that this medication should only be used under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  It's not a first-line treatment for depression in many cases, and alternative antidepressants might be considered first.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose for depression is 240-480 mg per day.  In cases of severe depression, this can be increased to a maximum of 720 mg per day, but this should only be done under careful medical supervision.  For elderly patients, the starting dose is lower, typically 240 mg per day, with a maximum of 480 mg per day.  The dose should always be carefully adjusted based on the individual's response and tolerance.

* **Intravenous/Intramuscular (IV/IM):**  An initial dose of 120-240 mg per day may be given intravenously or intramuscularly, gradually increasing to a maximum of 360 mg per day. This route of administration is typically reserved for specific clinical situations and will be determined by a healthcare provider.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dibenzepin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 17.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dosage may need adjustment in patients with liver or kidney problems. For those with severe liver disease, dibenzepin is generally contraindicated.  For renal impairment, specific dosage adjustments aren't provided in current guidelines but should be assessed by a physician.

**Important Note:**  The provided dosages are for informational purposes only.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose and route of administration based on individual patient factors.  Never alter your dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.

### How it Works

Dibenzepin is a tricyclic antidepressant that works primarily by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation. It also possesses antihistaminic and weak anticholinergic properties. By interfering with the reuptake process, dibenzepin increases the levels of norepinephrine in the brain, which can help alleviate symptoms of depression. However, the exact mechanism by which it achieves its antidepressant effect is not fully understood. The therapeutic benefits typically take several weeks to become apparent, suggesting a complex interaction within the central nervous system.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dibenzepin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, recent myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, severe liver disease, a current manic episode, and those concurrently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

* **Interactions:**  Dibenzepin can interact with many other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effects, or leading to increased adverse effects. These include, but are not limited to: cimetidine, diltiazem, disulfiram, methylphenidate, ritonavir, verapamil, carbamazepine, rifampicin, estrogens, adrenaline, amiodarone, general anesthetics, SSRIs, antihistamines, antimuscarinics, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, disopyramide, diuretics, flecainide, MAOIs, moclobemide, moxifloxacin, nefopam, nicorandil, noradrenaline, pimozide, procainamide, propafenone, quinidine, selegiline, sibutramine, sotalol, terfenadine, thioridazine, and tramadol.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, paralytic ileus, prostatic hypertrophy, heart failure, epilepsy, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, bronchial asthma, history of mania or other psychoses, urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, or diabetes.  Dibenzepin should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  There's an increased risk of suicidality, particularly at the beginning of treatment.  Patients should be monitored closely.
