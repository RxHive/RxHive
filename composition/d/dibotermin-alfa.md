# Dibotermin Alfa
### Generic Name
Dibotermin Alfa

### Usage
Dibotermin alfa is a protein used to promote bone formation.  Its primary use is as a substitute for autologous bone graft in single-level lumbar interbody spine fusion surgery for adults with degenerative disc disease who have had at least six months of unsuccessful non-operative treatment.  A secondary use is as an adjunct to standard care (open fracture reduction and intramedullary unreamed nail fixation) in the treatment of acute tibia fractures in adults.  It's crucial to understand that Dibotermin alfa does *not* provide structural support; it aids in bone growth.

### Dosage

**Single-level lumbar interbody spine fusion:**

*   The amount of Dibotermin alfa used depends on the size and shape of the fusion device and the intervertebral disc space. Typically, 4 mg (2.7 cm³ of wetted matrix) is implanted within the lumbar interbody fusion device or the anterior portion of the intervertebral disc space.  The maximum dose is 8 mg (5.3 cm³ of wetted matrix) within the intervertebral disc space.  Precise volume determination is crucial and should be guided by the specifics of the surgical situation.

**Acute tibia fracture:**

*   A 12 mg pack is implanted per fracture site. The maximum dose is 24 mg (two 12 mg packs). The amount used will vary depending on the fracture's anatomy and the ability to close the wound without excessive packing or compression of the product.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Dibotermin alfa in children under 18 years of age have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended for patients with hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not specified in current labeling):

*   Nervous system issues: Radiculopathy (including radiculitis, lumbar radiculopathy, radicular pain, lumbosacral radiculitis, and sciatica).
*   Musculoskeletal issues: Heterotopic ossification (including exostosis, extraskeletal ossification, postoperative heterotopic calcification, increased bone formation, and implant-site calcification), osteolysis (bone loss), and increased bone resorption.
*   Infections: Localized infection at the implant site.
*   Other: Device dislocation and fluid collections (e.g., localized edema, pseudocyst, and implant-site effusion).


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects can also occur.  It is vital to contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works
Dibotermin alfa is an osteoinductive protein.  This means it stimulates the formation of new bone tissue at the implant site.  It achieves this by binding to receptors on mesenchymal cells, causing them to differentiate into cells that form cartilage and bone.  This process results in the gradual replacement of the Dibotermin alfa implant with trabecular bone (spongy bone).

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Hypersensitivity to Dibotermin alfa or any component of the formulation.
*   Skeletal immaturity.
*   Active malignancy or treatment for malignancy.
*   Active infection at the surgical site.
*   Persistent compartment syndrome or neurovascular residua of compartment syndrome.
*   Pathological fractures (e.g., those associated with Paget's disease or metastatic bone disease).


**Warnings and Increased Risks:**

*   Immune responses.
*   Heterotopic ossification (formation of bone in abnormal locations).
*   Increased bone resorption (breakdown of bone).
*   Fluid collection (e.g., pseudocyst, edema, effusion).

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Dibotermin alfa is not recommended during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception due to unknown risks to the fetus.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; a decision regarding breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.

**General Considerations:**  Dibotermin alfa should only be administered by a qualified surgeon following established surgical procedures.  Specific implantation techniques vary depending on whether the procedure is for spine fusion or tibia fracture repair.  The manufacturer's instructions should be followed carefully.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Dibotermin alfa to work?**
A: Bone formation is a gradual process. The timeframe for noticeable bone growth will vary depending on individual factors and the specific application (spine fusion or tibia fracture).


**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after receiving Dibotermin alfa.


**Q: How is Dibotermin alfa stored?**
A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with the medication.  Generally, it's crucial to maintain proper temperature and avoid damage to the packaging.


**Q:  Is Dibotermin alfa suitable for all types of fractures?**
A: No,  current approval is limited to acute tibia fractures treated with specific surgical techniques.


**Q: Can Dibotermin alfa be used in children?**
A: No, the safety and effectiveness of Dibotermin alfa in children have not been established.
