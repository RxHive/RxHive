# Dexfenfluramine
### Generic Name
Dexfenfluramine

### Usage
Dexfenfluramine is a serotonergic anorectic drug, meaning it affects serotonin levels in the brain to suppress appetite.  Its primary use was in the management of obesity, aiding in weight loss and maintaining weight loss when combined with a low-calorie diet.  It is important to note that Dexfenfluramine is no longer available on the market due to serious safety concerns.

### Dosage
Because Dexfenfluramine is no longer available, specific dosage information is not applicable.  The drug was previously available in various formulations, but detailed dosage recommendations varied based on individual patient needs, including age, weight, and the severity of obesity.  Dosage adjustments were guided by a physician's assessment.

### Side Effects
Dexfenfluramine's withdrawal from the market stemmed from serious side effects, including:

*   **Valvular heart disease:**  Damage to the heart valves.
*   **Pulmonary hypertension:** High blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs.
*   Other, less severe side effects may have included (though complete data is limited):  headache, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and dry mouth.

**It is crucial to emphasize that if any adverse effects occurred while taking this medication (even if it was in the past), a healthcare provider should be consulted immediately.**

### How it Works
Dexfenfluramine increases the activity of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain that influences appetite.  It achieves this by increasing serotonin release into synapses (the spaces between nerve cells), inhibiting its reuptake, and directly stimulating postsynaptic serotonin receptors.  The increased serotonin activity in the brain ultimately leads to a decrease in appetite, particularly for carbohydrates.


### Precautions
Dexfenfluramine is no longer available due to serious risks of valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.  Therefore, precautions are not relevant for current use.  However, the historical data highlights the importance of careful medical supervision for any appetite suppressant medication.
