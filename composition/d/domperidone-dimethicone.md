# Domperidone + Dimethicone
### Generic Name
Domperidone + Dimethicone


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with gastrointestinal distress, particularly in conditions involving nausea, vomiting, and bloating.  Domperidone is a prokinetic agent that helps to speed up the movement of food through the stomach and intestines, reducing the feeling of fullness and nausea. Dimethicone is an anti-foaming agent that helps to break down gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, reducing bloating and discomfort.  The combined effect offers relief from symptoms like heartburn, indigestion, and flatulence often experienced after meals or in conditions like dyspepsia. While primarily used for symptomatic relief, it may be beneficial in managing symptoms associated with certain gastrointestinal disorders. However, it's crucial to understand that this medication doesn't treat the underlying cause of the gastrointestinal problem, only the symptoms.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation available (e.g., tablets, suspension), age, and the severity of symptoms.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  There's typically no established pediatric dosage for this combination specifically,  and usage in children should only occur under strict medical supervision.  

**Adults (Oral):**  The typical adult dose is usually one or two tablets or the equivalent amount of oral suspension as directed by a physician, typically taken after meals.

**Children (Oral):**  This combination is generally not recommended for children without specific advice from a pediatrician.  The appropriateness and dosage would need individual assessment.

**IV Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously. Domperidone and Dimethicone are primarily formulated for oral use.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Headache, drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth.  These are generally mild and transient.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Though rare, serious side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), irregular heartbeat, and changes in mood or mental state.  

**Important Note:** If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Domperidone works by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract.  This action helps to reduce nausea and vomiting and speeds up gastric emptying.  Dimethicone acts as an anti-foaming agent, reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the digestive system.  This allows the gas bubbles to coalesce and be more easily expelled, relieving bloating and flatulence.  The combined effect provides relief from multiple digestive symptoms.
