# Droperidol
### Generic Name
Droperidol

### Usage
Droperidol's primary use is in preventing and treating nausea and vomiting caused by surgery and diagnostic procedures (postoperative nausea and vomiting or PONV).  It's also used off-label in several situations, including: managing acute, undifferentiated agitation (often in combination with a benzodiazepine), treating migraine headaches, and as an adjunct in general anesthesia.  It's important to note that these off-label uses are not as well-established as its use for PONV and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and other medications being used.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Adults:**

* **PONV:** The FDA recommends a maximum initial dose of 2.5 mg intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Additional doses of 1.25 mg may be given cautiously only if the benefits outweigh the risks.  However, guideline recommendations often suggest lower initial doses (0.625-1.25 mg IV) given at the end of surgery.
* **Acute Agitation (off-label):**  Initial doses range from 5-10 mg IM or 2.5-10 mg IV, often combined with a benzodiazepine.  The dose can be repeated every 5 minutes (IV) until sedation is achieved, up to a maximum of 20 mg per episode.
* **Migraine (off-label):**  A typical dose is 2.5 mg IM.
* **General Anesthesia (off-label):**  A dose of 5 mg IV may be administered before other medications like meperidine and diazepam.


**Children:**

* **PONV:**  The safety and efficacy of droperidol in children under 2 years old haven't been established.  For children aged 2-12 years, the initial dose is generally no more than 0.1 mg/kg IM or IV, with additional doses given cautiously. Guidelines might suggest even lower doses (0.05-0.075 mg/kg IV). Adolescents might receive initial doses similar to adults (up to 2.5 mg, with cautious increases).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in these cases.


### Side Effects
Droperidol can cause various side effects, ranging from common to rare and serious.

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, anxiety, restlessness.
* **Less Common, but Serious:**  Prolonged QT interval (can lead to potentially fatal heart rhythm disturbances like torsades de pointes), low blood pressure (especially orthostatic hypotension), extrapyramidal symptoms (muscle stiffness, spasms, involuntary movements), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a rare but life-threatening condition affecting the nervous system).  Other less common side effects include respiratory issues (bronchospasm, laryngospasm), and allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

**Important:** If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Droperidol is a butyrophenone antipsychotic.  Its antiemetic (anti-nausea and vomiting) effect comes from blocking dopamine's action in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the brain.  This zone plays a vital role in triggering nausea and vomiting.  Droperidol also affects the nervous system and blood vessels, leading to effects such as decreased blood pressure and reduced pulmonary artery pressure.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Droperidol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known or suspected QT prolongation (a heart condition), congenital long QT syndrome, or hypersensitivity to droperidol.  It's also contraindicated in children under 2 years old.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid using droperidol concurrently with medications that prolong the QT interval (certain antihistamines, antimalarials, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants), or other CNS depressants (like barbiturates) as these can increase the risk of serious side effects.  Caution is needed with drugs that can cause low potassium or magnesium levels.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Droperidol is a Pregnancy Category C drug; its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered. Its excretion into breast milk is unknown, hence caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, heart conditions, low blood pressure, a history of seizures, or those at risk of aspiration pneumonia.  Elderly and debilitated patients also require close monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does droperidol stay in my system?** A: The duration varies depending on factors like dosage, metabolism, and kidney function.  Itâ€™s generally cleared relatively quickly, but specifics need medical assessment.

* **Q: Can I take droperidol with other medications?** A:  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're taking to avoid potential interactions. Some combinations are contraindicated.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Don't try to double up on doses; consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.

* **Q: Is droperidol addictive?** A:  Droperidol is not considered addictive in the same way as some opioids or other drugs of abuse; however, misuse or improper use should always be avoided.
