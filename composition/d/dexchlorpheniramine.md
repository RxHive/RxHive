# Dexchlorpheniramine

**Generic Name:** Dexchlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:**

Dexchlorpheniramine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever, and other upper respiratory allergies.  These symptoms include:

* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itching of the nose and throat

It's also sometimes used to treat allergic reactions to insect bites or stings, though other medications might be preferred in more serious cases.  It's important to note that dexchlorpheniramine does *not* treat the underlying cause of allergies, only the symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness (this is a very common side effect)
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Upset stomach
* Blurred vision

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Difficulty urinating
* Fast heartbeat
* Seizures
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Severe drowsiness or difficulty waking up

**How it Works:**

Dexchlorpheniramine is a first-generation antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens.  Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with allergies. By blocking histamine's effects, dexchlorpheniramine helps to relieve these symptoms.
