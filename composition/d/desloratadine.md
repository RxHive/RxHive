# Desloratadine

**Generic Name:** Desloratadine

**Usage:**

Desloratadine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies. These symptoms include:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itchy nose and throat
* Hives (urticaria)

It's also used to relieve symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria (a type of hives).  It's available in tablet and liquid form for oral administration.  It's generally taken once daily.  It's important to follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.


**Side Effects:**

Desloratadine is generally well-tolerated, but some people may experience side effects, which are usually mild. These can include:

* Drowsiness (although less common than with some other antihistamines)
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Stomach pain


**Serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately.** These might include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis): characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures


**How it Works:**

Desloratadine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. This means it works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes many of the symptoms of allergies. By blocking histamine's action, desloratadine helps to relieve these symptoms.  It's a non-sedating antihistamine, meaning it's less likely to cause drowsiness than some other antihistamines.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take desloratadine with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **Is desloratadine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Consult your doctor before taking desloratadine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking desloratadine?**  While desloratadine is less likely to cause drowsiness than some other antihistamines, combining it with alcohol could increase the risk of drowsiness or other side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit your consumption.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It usually starts to work within 30 minutes to an hour, but the full effect may take longer.
* **Is desloratadine habit-forming?** No, desloratadine is not habit-forming.
* **Can I use desloratadine for a cold or flu?** No, desloratadine only treats allergy symptoms and will not address symptoms of a cold or flu.  A doctor should be consulted for those illnesses.
