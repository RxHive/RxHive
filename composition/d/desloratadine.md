# Desloratadine
### Generic Name
Desloratadine

### Usage
Desloratadine is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  This includes symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and eyes, and nasal congestion. It's also effective in relieving itching, reducing the number and size of hives associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).  While not its primary indication, desloratadine has also been used off-label in the prophylaxis of NSAID-associated urticaria.  This means it can help prevent hives that sometimes occur after taking certain pain relievers (NSAIDs).

### Dosage

**Adults (â‰¥12 years):** The usual adult dose is 5 mg once daily. For those with hepatic or severe renal impairment, the dosage is typically reduced to 5 mg every other day.

**Children:**  Dosage for children varies significantly based on age:

* **2-5 years:** 1.25 mg once daily.
* **6-11 years:** 2.5 mg once daily.
* **<12 months:**  For infants, the dosage is even more specific and can depend on whether a tablet or syrup formulation is used. It's crucial to follow the specific instructions given by a doctor or pharmacist as different brands may have variations.  (Consult the prescribing information for your specific medication.)

**Administration:** Desloratadine comes in several forms, including tablets (including orally dissolving tablets), and syrup.  Orally disintegrating tablets should be placed directly on the tongue and allowed to dissolve. Syrup should be measured accurately using a calibrated measuring device.

It's extremely important to follow the prescribed dosage precisely, as provided by your physician or pharmacist, rather than relying on general guidelines.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking desloratadine and contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Desloratadine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions, causing many of the symptoms associated with allergies and hives. Desloratadine works by blocking histamine from binding to its receptors, thereby preventing these symptoms from developing or lessening their severity.  It is a long-acting medication, meaning a single daily dose is typically sufficient for 24-hour relief.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Desloratadine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to desloratadine, loratadine, or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Caution is advised when using desloratadine concurrently with medications that affect liver enzymes (like azithromycin, cimetidine, erythromycin, fluoxetine, and ketoconazole) as this can affect desloratadine's metabolism.  It is best to discuss potential interactions with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Hepatic/Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are often needed for people with moderate to severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Desloratadine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to a developing fetus haven't been fully established.  It's also excreted in breast milk.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before using desloratadine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Slow Metabolizers:** People who are slow metabolizers of desloratadine may experience a higher incidence of side effects.
