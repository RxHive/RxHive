# Disodium edetate
### Generic Name
Disodium edetate (also known as EDTA)

### Usage
Disodium edetate is primarily used as an antidote for heavy metal poisoning, specifically for lead, mercury, and other toxic metals.  It works by chelating, or binding, to these metals, forming a stable complex that the body can then excrete in the urine. This effectively removes the toxic metal from the bloodstream and tissues, reducing its harmful effects.  While its primary use is in acute heavy metal poisoning, it also has some applications in other areas, though these are less common and often require specific medical expertise. For example, it's sometimes used in certain diagnostic procedures to help remove calcium deposits or in the treatment of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), though other medications are typically preferred for these conditions.


### Dosage
Dosage of disodium edetate varies significantly depending on the specific metal involved, the severity of the poisoning, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  It's crucial to remember that **this medication is administered only under the strict supervision of a physician**.  There is no standard "over-the-counter" dosage.

* **Intravenous (IV) Administration:** This is the most common route for treating heavy metal poisoning.  The dose, frequency, and duration of treatment are determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician, usually using blood tests to monitor metal levels.  Dosage calculations involve complex factors and are not something to attempt without extensive medical training.

* **Oral Administration:** Oral forms exist but are less frequently used, mainly due to poor absorption and less effective chelation compared to intravenous administration.  Again, only a physician should determine the appropriate oral dose, if any, based on individual patient factors and the specific clinical scenario.

* **Pediatric Dosage:** Pediatric dosage is highly individualized and should always be determined by a physician considering the child's weight, age, and the severity of the poisoning.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Fever
* Muscle aches
* Burning sensation at the IV injection site (if administered intravenously)

Less common, but more serious, side effects may include:

* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) – This is a particular concern, especially with repeated doses.
* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) –  Kidney function should be closely monitored during treatment.
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

**If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works
Disodium edetate works by chelation.  It has a molecular structure that allows it to bind strongly to metal ions such as lead, mercury, and others.  Once bound, the metal-EDTA complex becomes water-soluble and is readily excreted from the body via the kidneys in the urine. This effectively removes the toxic metal from the bloodstream and tissues, thereby reducing its harmful effects.


### Precautions
* **Renal Impairment:**  Disodium edetate is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, individuals with impaired kidney function should be closely monitored during treatment to prevent the accumulation of the drug and potential toxicity.

* **Hypocalcemia:** Disodium edetate can lower blood calcium levels. Monitoring calcium levels is important, and calcium supplementation may be necessary.

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Allergic reactions, though uncommon, can occur.  Individuals with a known allergy to EDTA or any of its components should avoid its use.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of disodium edetate during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Its use should be carefully weighed against potential risks.  Consult a doctor for advice.

* **Drug Interactions:** There are potential interactions with other medications. Inform your physician about all medications, herbal supplements, and over-the-counter drugs you are taking.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I buy disodium edetate over the counter?**  A: No. Disodium edetate is a prescription medication and should only be used under the direct supervision of a physician.

* **Q: How is disodium edetate stored?** A: Store disodium edetate as directed by your physician or pharmacist, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Is disodium edetate safe for long-term use?** A:  No, prolonged use can lead to kidney damage and other complications.  Treatment is usually short-term and focused on removing acute heavy metal poisoning.

* **Q:  What should I do if I suspect heavy metal poisoning?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Do not attempt to self-treat.
