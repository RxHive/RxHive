# Desogestrel + Ethinylestradiol
### Generic Name
Desogestrel + Ethinylestradiol

### Usage
Desogestrel + Ethinylestradiol is a combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) primarily used to prevent pregnancy. It works by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening cervical mucus to hinder sperm from reaching the egg, and altering the uterine lining to make it less hospitable for implantation.  While its primary use is contraception, it's important to note that this medication does *not* protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### Dosage
**Adults (Females):** The standard dosage is one tablet taken orally once daily, at approximately the same time each day.  There are two main starting schedules:

* **Sunday Start:** Begin taking the pill on the first Sunday after the start of your menstrual period.  Use a backup contraceptive method for the first 7 days.
* **Day 1 Start:** Begin taking the pill on the first day of your menstrual period.

The medication comes in 21-day and 28-day packs.  For 21-day packs, take a pill daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day hormone-free interval where you'll likely experience withdrawal bleeding. A new pack is started on the 8th day.  For 28-day packs, take one pill daily without interruption.

**Children (Females):**  Desogestrel + Ethinylestradiol is not intended for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).  After menarche, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The medication is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for renal impairment, but caution is advised and close monitoring of blood pressure is essential.  Consider alternative contraceptive methods in these cases.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Breast tenderness or swelling
* Mood changes (including depression)
* Headaches
* Nausea
* Weight changes
* Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
* Changes in menstrual flow

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, heart attack)
* High blood pressure
* Liver tumors
* Gallbladder disease
* Vision changes

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Desogestrel + Ethinylestradiol is a combined hormonal contraceptive.  Ethinylestradiol is an estrogen, and desogestrel is a progestin.  They work synergistically to prevent pregnancy through a combination of mechanisms:

1. **Ovulation Suppression:** The hormones suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, preventing the maturation and release of an egg from the ovary.

2. **Cervical Mucus Thickening:** The hormones thicken the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to penetrate and reach the egg.

3. **Endometrial Changes:**  The hormones alter the lining of the uterus (endometrium), making it less receptive to a fertilized egg.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, certain types of cancers, liver disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure, migraine with aura, or those who smoke heavily (especially over 35).  It's also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Interactions:** This medication can interact with many other drugs, including some used to treat HIV, hepatitis C, and other conditions. Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.

* **Warnings:**  Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events when using this medication, especially in women over 35.  This medication may increase the risk of blood clots, high blood pressure, and certain types of cancer. Regular monitoring is crucial.  Caution is necessary in women with diabetes, obesity, or a family history of blood clots.

### FAQs

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a pill?** A:  If you miss one pill, take it as soon as you remember and continue with your regular schedule. If you miss two or more pills, follow the instructions provided in your medication leaflet, or consult your healthcare provider immediately.  You may need to use backup contraception.

* **Q: Can I still get pregnant while taking this medication?** A:  While highly effective, this medication is not 100% effective.  There's a small chance of pregnancy, especially if pills are missed or taken incorrectly.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects. Some side effects are common and may resolve on their own, but others require medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: Does this medication protect against STIs?** A: No, this medication only prevents pregnancy.  You should use barrier methods (like condoms) to protect against STIs.
