# Desloratadine + Pseuodoephedrine
### Generic Name
Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine is a combination medication used to relieve both nasal and non-nasal symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  Its primary use is to alleviate symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and itchy throat.  Importantly, it also targets nasal congestion, a symptom often not addressed by antihistamines alone.  This makes it a useful treatment for those experiencing the full range of allergic rhinitis symptoms.

### Dosage
**Adults (12 years and older):** The typical adult dose is one tablet (containing Desloratadine 2.5mg and Pseudoephedrine 120mg) every 12 hours. The maximum daily dose is two tablets (Desloratadine 5mg and Pseudoephedrine 240mg).

**Children (Under 12 years):** This combination medication is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  This medication is not recommended for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before use if you have any pre-existing medical conditions.  The medication should be taken orally, and tablets should be swallowed whole; do not crush or chew them.  It can be taken with or without food.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of users):**

* Nervous system: Insomnia, headache, fatigue, dizziness, somnolence (sleepiness), nervousness, and psychomotor hyperactivity (excessive movement).
* Gastrointestinal: Dry mouth (xerostomia), loss of appetite (anorexia), and nausea.
* Respiratory: Sore throat (pharyngitis).

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Palpitations, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), severe headache, excessive sleepiness, dizziness, allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis), movement disorders (dystonia, tics, extrapyramidal symptoms), seizures, elevated liver enzymes, and hepatitis.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious side effects, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Desloratadine is an antihistamine.  It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, desloratadine reduces the symptoms of allergic rhinitis like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.

Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and mucus production, thereby relieving nasal congestion.  The combination of these two actions provides relief from both the inflammatory and congestion aspects of allergic rhinitis.

**Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to loratadine, desloratadine, pseudoephedrine, or any other components of the medication.
