# Dimethicone

**Generic Name:** Dimethicone

**Usage:**

Dimethicone is a silicone-based polymer used in a wide variety of applications, both cosmetic and medicinal.  Its uses include:

* **Cosmetics:**  As a skin protectant in lotions, creams, and shampoos. It provides a smooth, silky feel and can help create a barrier to protect skin from moisture loss or irritation.  It's often found in anti-aging creams, sunscreens, and makeup.
* **Medicine:**  To treat symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders like bloating, gas, and heartburn.  It works by coating the lining of the digestive tract, reducing gas bubbles and promoting easier passage of stool. It's also used as a laxative in some cases. It can be found in some medications for treating infant colic.  Additionally, it's used topically to treat head lice and scabies.


**Side Effects:**

Dimethicone is generally considered safe for both topical and oral use, with relatively few side effects reported.  However, potential side effects can include:

* **Topical:**  Rare instances of skin irritation, rash, or allergic reactions.
* **Oral:**  Constipation (especially with higher doses), mild stomach upset.


**How it Works:**

Dimethicone's mechanism of action varies depending on its use:

* **Topical:**  It acts as a barrier, protecting the skin from external irritants and preventing moisture loss. It also has some lubricating properties.
* **Oral:**  It works as a demulcent, coating the lining of the gastrointestinal tract and reducing irritation.  This also helps to decrease gas bubble formation and promotes smoother bowel movements.


**FAQs:**

* **What happens if I accidentally ingest a large amount of dimethicone?**  Accidental ingestion of large amounts of dimethicone is unlikely to cause serious harm.  However, it is best to contact a healthcare professional or poison control center if you have concerns.
* **Can dimethicone cause weight gain?** There's no evidence to suggest dimethicone causes weight gain.
* **Is dimethicone absorbed into the body?**  Dimethicone is poorly absorbed into the body, whether applied topically or ingested orally.  The majority is eliminated unchanged in the stool.
