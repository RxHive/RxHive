# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Diphenhydramine
### Generic Name
Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Diphenhydramine

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu, particularly coughs and the accompanying congestion, sneezing, and runny nose.  Dextromethorphan hydrobromide acts as a cough suppressant, reducing the urge to cough.  Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or the common cold. While it's effective for symptom relief, it's important to remember this combination does *not* treat the underlying cause of the illness (like a viral infection).  It only targets the symptoms.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., liquid, tablet), the manufacturer, and the age and weight of the patient.  **It is crucial to always follow the instructions provided on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.**  Never exceed the recommended dose.

* **Adults:**  Dosage for over-the-counter (OTC) preparations is typically specified on the product packaging.  It often involves taking a specific amount every 4-6 hours, as needed, but not exceeding the maximum daily dose.

* **Children:** OTC formulations for children exist, but these are often age and weight-specific.  Always check the packaging for appropriate dosage based on the child's age and weight.  **Never give a medication intended for adults to a child.**

* **Oral:** Most formulations are oral (tablets, capsules, liquid).  Administer with water.

* **IV:** This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  IV administration of each component individually is possible in a hospital setting, but only under strict medical supervision.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Blurred vision

If you experience any serious or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Dextromethorphan hydrobromide works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't numb the throat or directly affect the airways but rather reduces the signals that trigger coughing.  Diphenhydramine blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released in the body during allergic reactions or infections. By blocking histamine, it reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.

### Precautions

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication, as it can increase drowsiness and other side effects.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Due to the potential for drowsiness, avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.

* **Liver or Kidney Disease:** Individuals with liver or kidney disease should exercise caution and consult their doctor before use.

* **Children:**  Follow age-appropriate dosing instructions carefully.
