# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Diphenhydramine

**Generic Name:** Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Diphenhydramine

**Usage:** This combination medication is an over-the-counter (OTC) drug used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, such as:

* Cough (suppresses cough reflex)
* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Watery eyes
* Body aches
* Fever (diphenhydramine may have a slight fever-reducing effect, but it's not its primary function)

It's important to note that this combination does *not* treat the underlying cause of the cold or flu, only the symptoms.  It's crucial to follow the dosage instructions on the product label and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist for more than a week.  This medication is not suitable for children under the age specified on the label.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of diphenhydramine.
* **Dry mouth:**  Both ingredients can contribute to this.
* **Dizziness:**  Especially with higher doses.
* **Constipation:**  A possibility, particularly with diphenhydramine.
* **Nausea:**  Less common but possible.
* **Blurred vision:**  Can occur, especially with diphenhydramine.
* **Headache:**  A potential side effect.
* **Irritability (in children):**  Diphenhydramine can cause this in some children.

Serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (DXM):** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works by affecting a specific part of the brain that triggers the cough reflex, reducing the urge to cough.

* **Diphenhydramine:** This is an antihistamine and has anticholinergic properties. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps to reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  Its anticholinergic properties contribute to drying up secretions.
