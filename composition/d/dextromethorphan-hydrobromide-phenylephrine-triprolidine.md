# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Triprolidine

**Generic Name:** Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Triprolidine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu in adults and children (as directed by a doctor or as per product labeling).  These symptoms include:

* Cough (suppressed by dextromethorphan)
* Runny nose (congested, relieved by phenylephrine)
* Sneezing and watery eyes (allergic symptoms relieved by triprolidine)


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, especially with triprolidine.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:**  A frequent complaint, can be managed with increased water intake.
* **Constipation:**  Relatively common, especially with higher doses.
* **Nausea:**  Less common, but can occur.
* **Dizziness:**  Possible, particularly with higher doses or in combination with alcohol or other sedatives.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):**  More likely with phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:**  Possible, especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Insomnia:**  Can occur, especially if taken late in the day.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, severe allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, swelling) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.


**How it Works:** This medication is a combination of three active ingredients, each working in a different way:

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that acts on the brain to reduce the cough reflex.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion.
* **Triprolidine:** An antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions, thus reducing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
