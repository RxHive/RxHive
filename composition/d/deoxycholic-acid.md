# Deoxycholic Acid
### Generic Name
Deoxycholic Acid

### Usage

Deoxycholic acid is a medication used to improve the appearance of moderate to severe fullness or convexity in the submental area (under the chin) in adults.  It's administered by injection directly into the subcutaneous fat in this specific region.  Importantly, its safety and effectiveness have not been established for treating subcutaneous fat in other areas of the body, and its use outside the submental area is not recommended.  The primary goal is to reduce the appearance of a double chin by breaking down fat cells.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Deoxycholic acid is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the submental fat. The dosage is area-adjusted, with 2 mg/cmÂ² injected into the subcutaneous fat tissue.  A single treatment involves a maximum of 50 injections of 0.2 mL each (up to a total of 10 mL), spaced 1 cm apart.  Up to six single treatments can be given, with at least a one-month interval between each treatment series.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of deoxycholic acid in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using this medication in patients with these conditions.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Paresthesia (pins and needles sensation)
* Injection-site pruritus (itching)
* Injection-site reaction (swelling, bruising, hematoma, pain, numbness, erythema [redness], and nodule formation)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Headache
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Nausea
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
* Skin tightness
* Warmth at the injection site
* Nerve injury at the injection site


**Rare Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Hemorrhage (bleeding) at the injection site
* Discoloration at the injection site
* Urticaria (hives) at the injection site
* Presyncope/syncope (near fainting/fainting)
* Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes)
* Neck pain

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Deoxycholic acid is a cytolytic drug, meaning it causes cell lysis (destruction of cell membranes). When injected into subcutaneous fat, it breaks down the fat cells, leading to a reduction in the volume of fat in the treated area. This ultimately results in a reduction in the appearance of fullness or convexity under the chin.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to deoxycholic acid or related components.
* Patients with an active infection at the injection site.

**Increased Risk:**

* Hematoma (bruising) at the injection site
* Marginal mandibular nerve injury
* Injection-site alopecia (hair loss)
* Injection-site ulceration and necrosis (tissue death)
* Tissue damage

**Caution:**

* Use with caution in patients with bleeding abnormalities or those receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.
* Use with caution in patients with a history of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).
* Use with caution in patients with a history of prior submental surgical or aesthetic treatments.
* Exercise caution when injecting near vulnerable anatomical structures, particularly the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.
