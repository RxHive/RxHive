# Dicalcium Phosphate
### Generic Name
Dicalcium Phosphate

### Usage
Dicalcium phosphate, also known as calcium dibasic phosphate, is primarily used to prevent or treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) in individuals whose dietary calcium intake is insufficient.  It's a crucial supplement for maintaining adequate calcium levels, essential for numerous bodily functions.  Secondary uses include aiding in the management of conditions arising from calcium deficiency, such as:

*   **Osteoporosis:** A condition characterized by weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Dicalcium phosphate helps to maintain bone density.
*   **Osteomalacia/Rickets:**  These are conditions causing soft, weakened bones due to insufficient calcium and vitamin D. Dicalcium phosphate contributes to strengthening bones.
*   **Hypoparathyroidism:** A disorder where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone, which is vital for calcium regulation. Dicalcium phosphate helps restore calcium balance.
*   **Latent Tetany:**  A condition causing muscle spasms and cramps due to low blood calcium. Dicalcium phosphate helps alleviate symptoms by increasing calcium levels.


### Dosage

**Note:**  The following dosage information is for guidance only.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions and recommendations.  Dosages are often tailored based on individual needs and response to treatment.  The amounts below refer to *elemental* calcium, meaning the actual amount of calcium available from the salt. The percentage of elemental calcium in a dicalcium phosphate supplement will vary depending on its source and purity, so check the product label for this information to ensure you are getting the intended amount of elemental calcium.


**Adults:**

* **Dietary Reference Intake (DRI):** The recommended daily intake of elemental calcium varies by age and gender, ranging from 1000mg to 1200mg daily for adults.
* **Hypocalcemia Treatment:**  Typically, 800-1200 mg of elemental calcium per day is prescribed.  Doses exceeding 600 mg should be divided to enhance absorption.


**Children:**

* **Dietary Reference Intake (DRI):**  The recommended daily intake of elemental calcium varies significantly with age, ranging from 200mg for infants to 1300mg for teenagers. See the original document for specific age ranges and values.
* **Hypocalcemia Treatment:** Dosage varies greatly by age and should be determined by a pediatrician.  The provided document shows 400-800 mg/day for children under 3, and 800mg/day for children aged 4-10.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling generally does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, in these cases, careful monitoring of serum calcium levels is crucial, and subsequent doses should be adjusted based on those levels to avoid accumulation and potential complications.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Nausea
* **Less Common but Serious:** Hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels in the blood), hypercalciuria (high calcium levels in the urine), myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining around the heart).


If you experience any adverse effects, immediately contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Dicalcium phosphate acts as a dietary supplement, primarily addressing calcium deficiency.  It replenishes calcium levels in the blood, which is crucial for a multitude of bodily functions including: nerve and muscle function, blood clotting, bone health, and cardiac function.  In conditions like osteoporosis, it helps to increase bone density by providing the necessary building blocks for stronger bones.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Dicalcium phosphate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Warnings:** Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) should use caution as some formulations may contain aspartame.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While not extensively listed in the provided text, it is important to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking, as interactions may occur.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Calcium crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.  However, the amount transferred is regulated physiologically and does not significantly alter the maternal calcium levels.  The recommended daily allowance during pregnancy and lactation is the same as in non-pregnant/non-lactating females.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take dicalcium phosphate without a doctor's prescription?**  A:  While it's often available as an over-the-counter supplement, it's crucial to consult a doctor, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications, to determine the appropriate dosage and ensure its safe use.

* **Q: How should I store dicalcium phosphate?**  A: Store according to the label instructions. Typically, this involves storing in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Is dicalcium phosphate safe for long-term use?**  A: Long-term safety depends on individual factors and proper dosage.  Regular monitoring of calcium and phosphate levels is essential with prolonged use.  Your doctor should be involved in determining the appropriateness of long-term supplementation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
