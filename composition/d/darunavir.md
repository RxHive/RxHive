# Darunavir
### Generic Name
Darunavir

### Usage

Darunavir is a protease inhibitor used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's crucial to understand that Darunavir is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral medications and ritonavir (a boosting agent that enhances its effectiveness).  This combination therapy is designed to suppress the HIV virus, improving the patient's health and quality of life.  Darunavir is indicated for both treatment-naive (never before treated for HIV) and treatment-experienced (previously treated for HIV) adult and pediatric patients (aged 3 years and older). The specific combination of drugs and dosage will depend on factors such as the patient's prior treatment history, viral load, and CD4 count.


### Dosage

Darunavir dosage varies significantly depending on several factors, including whether the patient is treatment-naive or -experienced, their weight (especially in pediatric patients), and the presence or absence of Darunavir resistance mutations.  It is *always* administered with ritonavir.  Dosage information provided below is for guidance only; a physician must determine the appropriate dosage based on individual patient needs.  

**Adults:**

* **Treatment-naive patients:** Typically 800 mg once daily (OD) with 100 mg of ritonavir, taken with food.
* **Treatment-experienced patients (no Darunavir resistance):**  Typically 800 mg OD with 100 mg of ritonavir, taken with food.
* **Treatment-experienced patients (with Darunavir resistance or unknown resistance):** Typically 600 mg twice daily (BID) with 100 mg of ritonavir, taken with food.  Genotypic testing is strongly recommended to guide dosage selection in this group.
* **Pregnant patients:**  The recommended dose is generally 600 mg BID with 100 mg of ritonavir.  Switching to an 800mg once-daily dose should only be considered in certain circumstances, such as where the patient was already on this regimen prior to pregnancy, has excellent viral suppression, and a dose change could negatively impact tolerability or compliance. This should be discussed with the physician.


**Pediatric Patients (â‰¥3 years):**

Dosage for pediatric patients is weight-based and determined according to the patient's weight and treatment history.  Both oral tablet and suspension formulations exist; the appropriate dosage and form will be specified by a physician.  The medication is always coadministered with ritonavir.  A healthcare professional should provide precise instructions and dosing according to the child's weight.  

**Important Note:**  Darunavir should be taken with food to enhance absorption.  Detailed instructions regarding the use of oral suspensions, including the use of appropriate measuring devices, must be followed carefully.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or reported in post-marketing surveillance):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Abnormal dreams
* Abdominal pain
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Increased cholesterol and triglycerides
* Hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema)
* Acute pancreatitis
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)


If any adverse effects occur, including those not listed above, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Darunavir is a protease inhibitor.  HIV-1 requires a protease enzyme to assemble new virus particles.  Darunavir works by selectively blocking the activity of this enzyme, preventing the virus from replicating and spreading. By hindering the production of mature, infectious HIV-1 particles, darunavir helps suppress the viral load and improve the immune system's ability to fight the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Darunavir is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.  It should also not be used with certain medications due to potentially dangerous drug interactions (see Interactions section).
* **Drug Interactions:** Darunavir has numerous potential drug interactions.  Many medications, especially those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, should be avoided or used with extreme caution when taking Darunavir.  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Darunavir should be used with caution in patients with liver disease and is generally not recommended for those with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** While dosage adjustments are not explicitly indicated in the labeling, renal function should be monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Darunavir is a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, closely monitored, and only undertaken under the guidance of a physician. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
* **Other Precautions:**  Darunavir can increase the risk of diabetes, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides), and redistribution of body fat.  Regular monitoring of blood glucose and lipid levels is important during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Darunavir if I feel better?** A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to the development of drug-resistant HIV, making future treatment more difficult.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  The instructions for managing missed doses vary slightly depending on whether you're taking Darunavir once or twice daily. Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for precise guidance.

* **Q: How should I store Darunavir?** A: Store Darunavir tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  For oral suspension, follow the manufacturer's specific storage instructions.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Darunavir?** A:  It's recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking Darunavir.  Alcohol can interact with the medication and potentially exacerbate side effects.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with Darunavir?** A: Long-term use of Darunavir can be associated with several potential long-term effects, including changes in lipid profiles, blood glucose levels and body fat distribution. Regular monitoring by your doctor is crucial to detect and manage these potential complications.
