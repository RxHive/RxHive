### Generic Name
Dicyclomine + Mefenamic Acid + Pamabrom


**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination widely available in many countries.  The information below describes the individual components and their potential combined effects.  It is crucial to understand that this information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication, especially a combination not specifically prescribed by a healthcare professional.  The specific formulation and dosage will depend on the prescription provided.


### Usage

This combination typically targets the symptoms of painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea).  Let's break down the individual components:

* **Dicyclomine:** This is an antispasmodic agent that helps to relax the smooth muscles in the uterus, reducing cramping pain.
* **Mefenamic Acid:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing inflammation and pain. It helps to decrease the production of prostaglandins, which are hormones contributing to menstrual pain.
* **Pamabrom:** This is a diuretic (water pill) and mild smooth muscle relaxant.  Its role in this combination is mainly to reduce water retention, which may contribute to bloating and discomfort during menstruation.

Therefore, the combination aims to manage menstrual pain through a multi-pronged approach addressing muscle spasms, inflammation, and fluid retention.


### Dosage

There is no standard, universally approved dosage for this specific combination as it's not a pre-packaged, commercially available fixed-dose formulation.  The dosage of each component would be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's needs and health status.  Dosage will vary greatly depending on the prescription provided.  There is no information available on pediatric or IV usage for this specific combination. Always follow the prescribed dosage and instructions carefully.
