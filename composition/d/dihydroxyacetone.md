# Dihydroxyacetone
### Generic Name
Dihydroxyacetone

### Usage
Dihydroxyacetone is primarily used topically to treat skin hypopigmentation. This means it helps darken areas of the skin that have lost their natural pigment, a condition often seen in vitiligo, scars, or other causes of depigmentation.  While its main use is for cosmetic purposes to improve skin color, it has also been used off-label in combination with lawsone as a form of sun protection.  This off-label use is not as widely established or studied as its use for hypopigmentation.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**

* **Skin hypopigmentation:**  A 5% or 20% cream is applied topically as a thin layer to the affected skin areas. Leave it on for at least two hours, or longer for a deeper color. Reapplication every four hours might be necessary until the desired shade is achieved.  The color typically lasts for three to six days before gradually fading.

* **Photosensitivity prophylaxis (off-label):**  When used in combination with lawsone for sun protection, Dihydroxyacetone and lawsone solutions are applied separately and sequentially. A liberal amount of Dihydroxyacetone is applied first (ideally the evening before sun exposure), followed by lawsone after 15 minutes. This process is repeated until three applications of each have been applied. The frequency may be reduced to once daily or every third day afterwards, and reapplication is needed after swimming or heavy sweating.  **It is crucial to understand that this is an off-label use and needs a doctor's supervision.**


**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Skin hypopigmentation (children >2 years):** The dosage is the same as for adults. However, use in children younger than 2 years should be under strict medical supervision.

* **Photosensitivity prophylaxis (children >2 years):**  The dosage is the same as for adults, but again, use in children under 2 should be under close medical guidance.  Use in infants under 6 months is generally not recommended unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
* Skin irritation
* Erythema (redness)
* Vesicles (small blisters)
* Wheals (raised, itchy bumps)
* Rashes
* Allergic dermatitis

While less common, more serious adverse reactions are possible.  If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to seek medical advice.

### How it Works
Dihydroxyacetone interacts with the amino acids in the skin's keratin layer. This reaction leads to a temporary darkening of the skin.  The altered keratin also appears to enhance the skin's natural UV protection, though the degree of this effect varies depending on factors such as application frequency, skin type, and UV exposure.  Essentially, it doesn't block UV rays directly like a sunscreen; it alters the skin's surface to improve its light-screening capabilities.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Dihydroxyacetone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Dihydroxyacetone should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised.

* **General Precautions:** Always prepare the skin before application (cleanse and exfoliate). Avoid applying to broken or irritated skin, around the eyes, or on abraded areas. Be mindful that it can stain clothing and hair.  Discontinue use if a rash develops.

### FAQs
* **Q: How long does the color last?** A: The color typically lasts for three to six days before gradually fading.  Regular application is necessary to maintain the desired shade.

* **Q: Can I use Dihydroxyacetone every day?** A:  While you can reapply it regularly to maintain color, follow the specific instructions on the product label. Overuse can potentially increase the risk of skin irritation.

* **Q: Is Dihydroxyacetone a sunscreen?** A:  No, Dihydroxyacetone is not a sunscreen in the traditional sense. It darkens the skin, improving its natural UV protection to some degree, but it should not be used as a replacement for sunscreen.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a reaction?** A: Stop using the product immediately and consult a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should I store Dihydroxyacetone?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
