# Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin + Metformin

**Generic Name:** Dapagliflozin/Teneligliptin/Metformin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It is typically prescribed when diet, exercise, and monotherapy (using only one diabetes medication) haven't been sufficient to control blood sugar levels.  It's often used as a triple therapy option, meaning it combines three different types of diabetes medications to achieve better glycemic control.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.  These are often associated with the Metformin component.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Increased urination and risk of UTIs are linked to Dapagliflozin's mechanism of action.
* **Genital yeast infections (candidiasis):**  More common in women, also related to Dapagliflozin.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** More likely if also taking other diabetes medications or insulin, particularly Teneligliptin.  Symptoms include shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion.
* **Weight loss:**  Often a beneficial side effect of Dapagliflozin.
* **Dehydration:** Due to increased urination.


**Serious side effects, though less common, include:**

* **Lactic acidosis (build-up of lactic acid in the blood):** A rare but serious side effect primarily associated with Metformin, particularly in individuals with kidney problems or those experiencing dehydration.  Symptoms include muscle pain, weakness, unusual tiredness, trouble breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect lactic acidosis.
* **Ketoacidosis:**  A serious condition characterized by a build-up of ketones in the blood. More likely if poorly controlled diabetes.
* **Severe allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through three different mechanisms to lower blood sugar:

* **Dapagliflozin (SGLT2 inhibitor):** Blocks the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine. This reduces blood glucose levels.
* **Teneligliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor):** Increases the levels of incretins, hormones that stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar).  This improves insulin secretion and reduces glucose production by the liver.
* **Metformin (Biguanide):** Decreases glucose production by the liver and improves insulin sensitivity in the body's tissues.


**FAQs:**

* **Who shouldn't take this medication?**  Individuals with severe kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, or a history of lactic acidosis should generally not take this medication, particularly the Metformin component. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor.
* **How is it taken?**  Usually taken orally, once or twice daily with food, as directed by a doctor.
* **What are the potential drug interactions?**  Many medications can interact with this combination.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **What if I miss a dose?** Take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **What should I monitor?**  Regularly monitor your blood sugar levels as directed by your doctor.  Pay attention to any signs of side effects, particularly those mentioned above.
* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  No, you should gradually reduce your dosage under the guidance of your doctor to avoid potential problems.
