# Dimetindene (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Dimetindene (Systemic)

### Usage
Dimetindene is an antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies and itching.  Its main uses include treating urticaria (hives), hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies, regardless of the season. It's also effective in alleviating itching from various sources, such as chickenpox and insect bites (excluding itching caused by cholestasis).  Additionally, dimetindene is sometimes used as an adjunct therapy in eczema and other itchy skin conditions.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For allergies, the typical dose is 1-2 mg three times a day (TID).  Individuals susceptible to drowsiness might benefit from taking 1 mg in the morning and 2 mg at bedtime.  Always follow the instructions on your prescription.

**Children:** Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age and weight.  Generally, for allergies, it's 0.1 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses given every 8 hours.  However, specific age-based guidelines often exist:

* **Infants (1 month to ≤1 year):** 0.15-0.5 mg (3-10 drops of oral solution) TID.
* **Children (1 to <3 years):** 0.5-0.75 mg (10-15 drops of oral solution) TID.
* **Children (3 to <12 years):** 0.75-1 mg (15-20 drops of oral solution) TID or 1 mg TID (tablet).
* **Children (≥12 years):**  Same as the adult dose.

**Important Note:**  20 drops of the oral solution generally equal 1 mg of dimetindene.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully, as dosages can vary depending on the specific formulation (oral solution, tablet) and the severity of the condition.

### How it Works
Dimetindene is a competitive inhibitor of histamine H1 receptors.  This means it competes with histamine for binding sites on these receptors, effectively blocking histamine's action.  Histamine is a chemical released during allergic reactions, causing symptoms like itching, swelling, and inflammation.  By blocking histamine, dimetindene reduces these symptoms.  Additionally, dimetindene may also have effects on other substances involved in allergic responses such as bradykinin, serotonin, and acetylcholine.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Dimetindene is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to dimetindene or any formulation component; those under 1 month of age; breastfeeding women; those using MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of discontinuation); and in children under 3 years of age (for some products).

**Warnings and Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with epilepsy, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia/urinary retention, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and when performing tasks requiring alertness (e.g., driving).  The drug may increase the risk of CNS depression.  Neonates should be carefully monitored.


**Drug Interactions:** Dimetindene can interact with numerous medications, including but not limited to CNS depressants, MAO inhibitors, alcohol, and other antihistamines.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to minimize the risk of adverse interactions.
