# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Paracetamol (This is a combination drug, so there isn't one single generic name covering all brands.  The names listed above represent the individual active ingredients.)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or the flu.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan hydrombromide is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It helps to reduce the urge to cough.
* **Nasal Congestion:** Phenylephrine is a decongestant. It helps to shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Pain and Fever:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is an analgesic (pain reliever) and an antipyretic (fever reducer). It helps to reduce pain and lower fever.

**Important Note:** This medication only treats *symptoms*. It does not cure the underlying illness (like a viral infection).


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:**  Dextromethorphan can cause drowsiness.
* **Dizziness:** Both dextromethorphan and phenylephrine can cause dizziness.
* **Nausea:**  A possible side effect of any of the components.
* **Headache:**  Relatively common, potentially from any of the ingredients or the illness itself.
* **Insomnia:**  Especially with higher doses or later in the day.
* **Increased blood pressure:** Phenylephrine can raise blood pressure.
* **Irritability:** Though less common, this can be a side effect, particularly with children.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including skin rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.

This list is not exhaustive, and more serious side effects are possible.  Always consult the product information leaflet for a complete list of side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus in the brain, and reduces pain through a mechanism not completely understood, but believed to involve inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
