# Dalfopristin
### Generic Name
Dalfopristin/Quinupristin (Synercid)

**Note:** Dalfopristin is always used in combination with quinupristin.  They are often referred to together as "dalfopristin/quinupristin" or by the brand name Synercid. This information refers to the combination therapy.

### Usage

Dalfopristin/quinupristin is a powerful antibiotic combination primarily used to treat serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics.  Its main use is in treating infections caused by *Enterococcus faecium*, a type of bacteria that can cause bloodstream infections, wound infections, and other serious illnesses, especially in hospital settings.  It may also be used for treating infections caused by other Gram-positive bacteria such as *Staphylococcus aureus* (including methicillin-resistant strains, or MRSA in some cases), although other antibiotics are often preferred as first-line treatment for these.  The combination also shows activity against some Gram-negative bacteria and Mycoplasma species, though its use is less common in these instances.


### Dosage

Dosage is determined by a healthcare professional based on the severity of the infection and the patient's weight and overall health. It's crucial to follow prescribed dosages exactly.  The typical adult dosage is usually administered intravenously (IV) and varies depending on the specific indication.  Information about specific dosages must come from a prescribing physician. Pediatric dosages are also determined by a physician based on weight and clinical needs. There are no oral formulations available.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Pain or inflammation at the injection site
*   Joint pain (arthralgia)
*   Muscle pain (myalgia)


Less common but serious side effects can include:

*   Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*   Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
*   Blood disorders
*   Neurological effects


If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Dalfopristin and quinupristin work synergistically, meaning they work better together than they do individually.  Dalfopristin inhibits the early stages of protein synthesis within bacterial ribosomes, while quinupristin inhibits the later stages. This combined action effectively stops the bacteria from producing essential proteins, ultimately leading to bacterial death.  This mechanism is particularly effective against bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.


### Precautions

*   **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor about any allergies, particularly to antibiotics.
*   **Liver and kidney function:** Dalfopristin/quinupristin can affect liver and kidney function.  Regular monitoring may be needed, especially in patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disease.
*   **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** The safety of dalfopristin/quinupristin during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before use.
*   **Drug interactions:**  Dalfopristin/quinupristin can interact with other medications. Provide your doctor with a complete list of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking.  Specific interactions are noted above in the provided text.
*   **Older adults and children:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for older adults and children.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection and your response to the medication.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.

*   **Q: Can I take this medication with food?** A:  This medication is administered intravenously, so food consumption is not a factor.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking this medication early if I feel better?** A: No, completing the full course of treatment is crucial to prevent the infection from returning and the development of antibiotic resistance.

*   **Q: How is this medication stored?** A:  Storage instructions will be provided by your pharmacist. Typically, it will require specific storage conditions to maintain its effectiveness.
