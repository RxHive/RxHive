# Diosmin + Hesperidin
### Generic Name
Diosmin + Hesperidin

### Usage
Diosmin and Hesperidin, a combination of flavonoids, is primarily used to treat symptoms related to venous insufficiency and hemorrhoids.  Venous insufficiency refers to conditions where the veins don't efficiently return blood to the heart, leading to symptoms like leg pain, swelling, and heaviness.  In hemorrhoids (swollen veins in the anus and rectum), this combination helps alleviate pain, bleeding, and inflammation.  While primarily used for these conditions, further research is needed to fully understand its broader therapeutic applications.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (tablets, granules, suspension), the condition being treated, and the severity of symptoms.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional and the product labeling.

**Adults:**

* **Hemorrhoids (Acute):**  Dosage typically starts high (e.g., 6 tablets of Diosmin 450mg/Hesperidin 50mg daily divided into three doses for 3-4 days) and then gradually reduces (e.g., to 4 tablets/day) for several days before transitioning to maintenance therapy.  Alternative formulations and dosages exist, so consult product labeling and your doctor.
* **Hemorrhoids (Chronic) and Venous Insufficiency:** Maintenance therapy usually involves one tablet of Diosmin 900mg/Hesperidin 100mg once or twice daily, or an equivalent dose of other formulations (granules, suspension).  

**Children:** The combination is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended based on liver or kidney function, but this should be discussed with your physician, especially if you have severe impairment of either organ.

**Administration:** Tablets are usually swallowed whole with water. Granules need to be dissolved in water before ingestion.  Suspension should be shaken well before use.  Taking the medication with food can help reduce potential gastrointestinal upset.

### How it Works
Diosmin and Hesperidin are bioflavonoids. The exact mechanism of their combined action isn't completely elucidated, but it's believed to involve a reinforcement of the vasoconstricting effect of noradrenaline on the vein walls.  This leads to improved venous tone, reduced venous hyperpressure, and better blood circulation, relieving symptoms associated with venous insufficiency and hemorrhoids.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Diosmin and Hesperidin are contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to either compound or any ingredient in the formulation. It's also contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with metronidazole might reduce the latter's metabolism.  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The use of Diosmin and Hesperidin is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to a lack of sufficient safety data.
* **Other Precautions:**  Always inform your doctor about your medical history, including any allergies, liver or kidney problems, and other health conditions before starting this medication.
