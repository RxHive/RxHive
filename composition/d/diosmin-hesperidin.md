# Diosmin + Hesperidin

**Generic Name:** Diosmin + Hesperidin

**Usage:**  Diosmin + Hesperidin is primarily used to treat symptoms related to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), such as:

* **Leg pain and heaviness:**  A common symptom of poor blood circulation in the legs.
* **Leg swelling (edema):**  Fluid buildup in the legs due to venous insufficiency.
* **Leg cramps:**  Muscle spasms in the legs.
* **Varicose veins:** Although it doesn't eliminate varicose veins, it can improve associated symptoms.
* **Hemorrhoids:**  Diosmin + Hesperidin is also used to alleviate symptoms of hemorrhoids, such as pain, bleeding, and inflammation.

**Note:**  It's crucial to consult a doctor before using Diosmin + Hesperidin, especially if you have underlying health conditions.  It's not a replacement for medical treatment of CVI or hemorrhoids.


**Side Effects:** Generally considered well-tolerated, side effects are usually mild and infrequent.  They can include:

* **Gastrointestinal disturbances:**  Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.
* **Headache:**  Less common.
* **Dizziness:**  Rare.
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, allergic reactions such as rash or itching can occur.


**How it Works:** Diosmin and Hesperidin are bioflavonoids (plant-derived substances with antioxidant properties).  Their mechanism of action in treating CVI symptoms is not fully understood, but it's believed they work through several pathways:

* **Reducing inflammation:** They help reduce inflammation in the blood vessels.
* **Improving venous tone:** They strengthen the walls of the veins, improving their ability to return blood to the heart.
* **Reducing capillary permeability:** They decrease the leakage of fluid from the capillaries into the surrounding tissues, reducing swelling.
* **Antioxidant effects:**  They protect blood vessels from damage caused by free radicals.
