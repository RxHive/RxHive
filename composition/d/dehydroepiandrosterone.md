# Dehydroepiandrosterone
### Generic Name
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)

### Usage
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone naturally produced by the adrenal glands.  As a supplement, it's primarily used to address adrenal insufficiency, a condition where the adrenal glands don't produce enough cortisol, aldosterone, and other essential hormones.  While its use in adrenal insufficiency has some supporting evidence,  it's important to note that the effectiveness and safety of DHEA for many other conditions remain under investigation or are not fully established.  Off-label uses, meaning uses not officially approved by regulatory bodies, include exploring its potential benefits in conditions like osteoporosis, depression, erectile dysfunction, systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer's disease, menopausal hot flashes, and dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse).  However,  the evidence supporting these off-label uses varies significantly in strength and reliability.  It's crucial to discuss these potential applications with a healthcare professional before considering DHEA supplementation.

### How it Works
DHEA is a precursor to several steroid hormones, including estrogen and testosterone. By increasing the levels of these hormones, it may influence various bodily functions.  Additionally, DHEA might impact neurotransmitter activity, though the exact mechanisms remain a subject of ongoing research.  Its effects are complex and not fully understood.
