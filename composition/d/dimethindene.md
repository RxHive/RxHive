# Dimethindene

**Generic Name:** Dimethindene

**Usage:** Dimethindene is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as:

*   Sneezing
*   Runny nose
*   Itchy, watery eyes
*   Itching
*   Hives

It's available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, and syrups.  It can also be found in combination with other medications for cold and flu symptoms.  **Important Note:** Dimethindene is not typically recommended for treating the common cold.  Its effectiveness is primarily for allergic symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, dimethindene can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

*   Drowsiness (this is a significant side effect and can impair driving and operating machinery)
*   Dry mouth
*   Constipation
*   Blurred vision
*   Nausea
*   Dizziness
*   Headache
*   Excitement (especially in children)

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

*   Difficulty urinating
*   Fast heartbeat
*   Seizures
*   Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)

**How it Works:** Dimethindene is a first-generation antihistamine.  It works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms associated with allergies.
