# Diflunisal
### Generic Name
Diflunisal

### Usage
Diflunisal is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  It's also effective in relieving mild to moderate pain.  While its main application lies in managing chronic inflammatory conditions and pain associated with them, it may be prescribed for acute pain situations as well, although other NSAIDs might be preferred in some cases.  The decision to use diflunisal for acute pain will depend on the individual patient's circumstances and the physician's assessment.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:** The usual adult dose is 500-1000 mg per day, divided into two doses. The maximum daily dose is 1500 mg.
* **Mild to Moderate Pain:**  A starting dose of 1000 mg is typically followed by 500 mg every 12 hours. Some patients may require a maintenance dose of 500 mg every 8 hours.  The maximum daily dose remains 1500 mg.

**Children:**

Diflunisal is generally not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age due to limited safety and efficacy data. For adolescents 12 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Forms:** Diflunisal is available as oral tablets.

**Administration:** Tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Taking the medication with food or milk may reduce gastrointestinal upset.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal or hepatic impairment may necessitate dosage adjustments or avoidance of the drug altogether.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.

### How it Works

Diflunisal works by reducing inflammation and pain. It does this by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that promote inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking the production of prostaglandins, diflunisal reduces these symptoms.  While the primary action is on COX enzymes, other mechanisms, such as influencing immune cell activity, may contribute to its overall anti-inflammatory effect.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Diflunisal is contraindicated in individuals with a history of allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs.  Symptoms like asthma, urticaria, or other allergic responses should alert the patient and their doctor to this possibility.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:** Diflunisal can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers. Individuals with a history of ulcers or those taking other medications that increase this risk (e.g., anticoagulants, corticosteroids) should use it with caution under medical supervision.
* **Cardiovascular Risks:**  NSAID use, including diflunisal, is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes, especially with long-term use or high doses.
* **Renal Function:**  Diflunisal can affect kidney function.  Those with pre-existing kidney disease should use it cautiously, and monitoring of kidney function is advisable.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Diflunisal is categorized as pregnancy category C. Its use during pregnancy, especially during the later stages, should be carefully evaluated by a physician due to potential risks to the fetus and infant.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Diflunisal can interact with many other drugs, including anticoagulants, diuretics, and lithium. Consult a healthcare professional to identify potential interactions with your current medications.
* **Alcohol and Smoking:** Alcohol consumption and smoking can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take diflunisal with other pain relievers?** A:  It's best to discuss this with your doctor.  Combining diflunisal with other NSAIDs or pain relievers could increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: How long can I take diflunisal?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your condition and response to the medication.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.
