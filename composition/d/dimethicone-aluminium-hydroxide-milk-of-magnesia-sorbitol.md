# Dimethicone + Aluminium Hydroxide + Milk Of Magnesia + Sorbitol

It's important to note that there is no established, widely recognized generic medication combining Dimethicone, Aluminium Hydroxide, Milk of Magnesia (Magnesium Hydroxide), and Sorbitol.  These ingredients are often found in various over-the-counter antacid and laxative products, but rarely all together in a single formulation.  Therefore, providing details in the requested format would be inaccurate and potentially misleading.

Each ingredient acts individually:

* **Dimethicone:** An anti-foaming agent that helps relieve gas and bloating.
* **Aluminium Hydroxide:** An antacid that neutralizes stomach acid.
* **Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia):** An antacid and laxative that neutralizes stomach acid and stimulates bowel movements.
* **Sorbitol:** A sugar alcohol that acts as a laxative by drawing water into the intestines.

Combining these ingredients would likely result in a product with both antacid and laxative properties, potentially causing diarrhea and other side effects.  It's crucial to **consult a doctor or pharmacist** before mixing medications or using products containing these ingredients together. They can assess your individual needs and recommend appropriate treatment.
