# Droxidopa
### Generic Name
Droxidopa

### Usage
Droxidopa is a medication used to treat orthostatic hypotension, a condition characterized by a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing. This drop can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.  Droxidopa specifically targets *neurogenic* orthostatic hypotension, meaning the cause is related to dysfunction of the nervous system controlling blood pressure.  This dysfunction can stem from several conditions including:

* **Primary autonomic failure:** This encompasses conditions where the autonomic nervous system (responsible for involuntary bodily functions) malfunctions without a clear underlying cause.
* **Parkinson's disease:** A progressive neurological disorder impacting movement and other bodily functions.
* **Multiple system atrophy (MSA):** A rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting multiple body systems.
* **Pure autonomic failure (PAF):** A specific type of primary autonomic failure.
* **Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency:** A rare genetic disorder affecting the production of norepinephrine.
* **Non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy:** Nerve damage affecting the autonomic nervous system in individuals without diabetes.

Droxidopa helps alleviate the symptoms associated with these conditions by increasing blood pressure when standing.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  The starting dose of Droxidopa is typically 100 mg three times daily (TID). This dose is gradually increased by 100 mg TID every 24-48 hours until the desired effect is achieved, or until a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg is reached.  The medication should be taken consistently, with or without food, upon waking, midday, and late afternoon—at least three hours before bedtime to minimize the risk of high blood pressure while lying down.  Droxidopa is administered orally as a capsule.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Droxidopa in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** For patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment (GFR > 30 mL/min), no dose adjustment is typically necessary.  However, for those with severe kidney impairment (GFR ≤ 30 mL/min), and for patients with liver impairment, specific dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling, and consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects (>10%):**

* Headache

**Less common side effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* High blood pressure (hypertension)
* Nausea

**Less frequent but serious side effects (reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Abdominal pain
* Agitation
* Blurred vision
* Stroke (cerebrovascular accident)
* Chest pain
* Confusion
* Delirium
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Hallucinations
* High fever (hyperpyrexia)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, skin rash, and urticaria)
* Memory impairment
* Pancreatitis
* Psychosis
* Vomiting

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Droxidopa is a precursor to norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure.  The body converts Droxidopa into norepinephrine. Norepinephrine causes the blood vessels to constrict, raising blood pressure. This is particularly helpful in orthostatic hypotension, where blood pressure falls sharply upon standing.  By increasing norepinephrine levels, Droxidopa helps maintain blood pressure even when changing posture.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Droxidopa is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Droxidopa or any components of the formulation.

**Drug Interactions:**  The concurrent use of Droxidopa with norepinephrine, ephedrine, and triptans may increase the risk of high blood pressure while lying down (supine hypertension).  Avoid these combinations.

**Warnings:**  A significant risk of supine hypertension (high blood pressure while lying down) exists.  Blood pressure should be carefully monitored, especially while lying down and when the dosage is increased. Elevating the head of the bed can help mitigate this risk.  Droxidopa should be used with caution in patients with ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure.  Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Droxidopa is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are not fully known.  It's not recommended during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Droxidopa with food?** A:  Droxidopa can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Droxidopa?** A: Store Droxidopa at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Droxidopa suddenly?** A:  No, you should not stop taking Droxidopa suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may worsen your condition.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a severe side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effect, such as chest pain, severe dizziness, or an allergic reaction.

* **Q: Does Droxidopa contain allergens?** A:  The formulation may contain FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine), a potential allergen.  Those with hypersensitivity to this dye should inform their physician.
