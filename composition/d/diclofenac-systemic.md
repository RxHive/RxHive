# Diclofenac (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Diclofenac (Systemic)

### Usage

Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve the signs and symptoms of various conditions.  Its primary uses include treating ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis – all forms of inflammatory arthritis.  It's also effective in managing primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) and migraine headaches (with or without aura).  Diclofenac is further used for the relief of mild-to-moderate pain and, in higher doses, moderate-to-severe pain.  It's important to note that while sometimes used for gout flares, this is generally considered an off-label use and other medications are typically preferred.

### Dosage

Diclofenac dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation (tablet, capsule, suppository, injection, or solution).  The following information is for general guidance only and should not replace the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.

**Adults:**

* **Ankylosing Spondylitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Gout:** Dosages range from 25mg to 150mg daily, administered orally, rectally, or via intramuscular injection (IM).  The IM route is generally limited to short-term use (up to 2 days) for severe flares, followed by a switch to oral or rectal formulations.  The maximum daily dose across all administration routes is usually 150mg. Specific dosages depend on the formulation (immediate-release, delayed-release, extended-release).
* **Primary Dysmenorrhea:**  Typically 50-150mg daily, often in divided doses, orally or rectally.
* **Migraine:**  Usually a single 50mg dose of the oral solution at the onset of a migraine.  A second dose is not generally recommended.
* **Pain:** Dosages vary widely, from 25mg to 150mg daily, depending on the severity and the chosen route of administration.  Intravenous (IV) administration may also be used for postoperative pain, with dosages and schedules determined by a physician.


**Children:** Dosage for children depends heavily on the condition, age, and weight, and is often calculated based on milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg).  Rectal suppositories are sometimes used for children, typically with dosages determined by a pediatrician.  Use in children is limited for specific conditions, and parental guidance is crucial.  Oral use is generally not recommended for children under 16.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  This is especially critical for patients with severe kidney problems, where use may be contraindicated. Always consult with a doctor before making any adjustments to your dosage.

If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, immediately contact your doctor or seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Diclofenac works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, diclofenac reduces inflammation, alleviates pain, and lowers fever.  While the primary mechanism is COX inhibition, other contributing factors to its anti-inflammatory effects are being researched.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Diclofenac is contraindicated for individuals with known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, aspirin, or any component of the formulation.  A history of asthma, urticaria, or other allergic reactions to NSAIDs is a major contraindication.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Diclofenac can cause serious gastrointestinal problems, including ulcers and bleeding.  Patients with a history of ulcers or bleeding should use it with extreme caution, if at all.
* **Cardiovascular Risk:** Diclofenac carries an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events such as heart attack and stroke. Patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors should be closely monitored.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Diclofenac is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  Patients with liver or kidney disease need careful monitoring, and dosage adjustments may be required or use entirely contraindicated.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Diclofenac is generally avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy.  Its use during the first and second trimesters should be carefully considered and only under the guidance of a physician.  Diclofenac is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should consult their doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Diclofenac can interact with numerous other medications, including anticoagulants, other NSAIDs, and certain diuretics.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients are at increased risk of side effects from diclofenac and should be closely monitored.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take diclofenac with alcohol?**  A: Combining diclofenac with alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects.  It’s best to avoid alcohol while taking diclofenac.

* **Q: How should I store diclofenac?** A: Store diclofenac at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.
