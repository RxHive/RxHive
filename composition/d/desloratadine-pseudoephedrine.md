# Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Desloratadine and Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of allergy and the common cold.  Desloratadine is an antihistamine that reduces allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes/nose/throat, and hives. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.  This combination is typically used for symptoms that involve both allergic reactions and nasal congestion.  It's important to note that this is not a cure for the underlying condition but rather a treatment for symptoms.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** Desloratadine can cause drowsiness in some people, though it is generally less sedating than other antihistamines.
* **Dry mouth:**  Both desloratadine and pseudoephedrine can cause dry mouth.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Insomnia:**  Especially with pseudoephedrine, taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:** Pseudoephedrine can increase blood pressure and heart rate.
* **Anxiety:**  Pseudoephedrine can cause anxiety in some individuals.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Such as skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **High blood pressure:**  Especially concerning for individuals with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Irregular heartbeat:**
* **Seizures:** (rare)


**How it Works:**

* **Desloratadine:** This is a non-sedating antihistamine.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Desloratadine blocks histamine from binding to its receptors, thus reducing allergic symptoms.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a sympathomimetic amine decongestant. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
