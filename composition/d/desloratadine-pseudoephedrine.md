# Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine
### Generic Name
Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage

Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  It combines two active ingredients: desloratadine, an antihistamine, and pseudoephedrine, a decongestant.

Desloratadine works by blocking histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. By blocking histamine, desloratadine helps to alleviate these allergic symptoms.

Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and congestion. This makes breathing easier and can improve sinus drainage.

The combination of desloratadine and pseudoephedrine is particularly effective in treating symptoms that involve both allergic reactions and nasal congestion, offering comprehensive relief.  It's primarily used for symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and the common cold, but its use should always be guided by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the specific formulation of the medication (e.g., tablet strength, extended-release), age, and overall health.  **Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  Never exceed the recommended dosage.

**Adults:**  Typical adult dosages are usually found on the product label and might include one tablet or capsule taken once daily. Extended-release formulations may require a lower frequency.

**Children:** This combination medication is generally not recommended for children under the age of 12.  Always consult a pediatrician before giving any medication to a child.  Separate medications containing desloratadine and pseudoephedrine for children (if available) will have specific age and weight-based dosing guidelines.

**Oral Administration:**  This combination medication is typically taken orally with a glass of water.  It should be taken as directed, usually once daily.  Avoid crushing or chewing extended-release tablets.

**IV Administration:** Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine is not available in an intravenous (IV) formulation.  These components are administered orally.

**Important Note:**  The information provided here is for general guidance only. Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for personalized dosage instructions. They can assess your individual needs and recommend the most appropriate dosage and formulation.

### How it Works

As mentioned earlier, desloratadine is an antihistamine. It works by competitively blocking histamine H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic reactions. This reduces symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose.

Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine, meaning it mimics the effects of the sympathetic nervous system.  It works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels).  This reduces swelling and congestion, improving nasal breathing.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with certain conditions, including severe heart disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or glaucoma.  Individuals with a history of allergic reactions to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine, or other similar medications should also avoid its use.  It is also contraindicated in people taking MAO inhibitors.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine may interact with other medications, such as MAO inhibitors, other decongestants, certain antidepressants, and some heart medications.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.
