# Doxylamine + Pyridoxine
### Generic Name
Doxylamine + Pyridoxine

### Usage
Doxylamine and pyridoxine is a combination medication used primarily to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (morning sickness).  It's specifically indicated for women whose symptoms haven't improved with conservative management (like dietary changes and rest).  It's important to note that this medication hasn't been studied in women with hyperemesis gravidarum (severe morning sickness).  The combination uses doxylamine, an antihistamine with sedative properties, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6), which plays a role in several metabolic processes, though the exact mechanism for relieving pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting isn't fully understood.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (delayed-release vs. extended-release) and the response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions carefully.

**Delayed-Release Formulation (Doxylamine 10mg + Pyridoxine 10mg):**

* **Day 1 & 2:** Two tablets at bedtime.
* **Day 3 (if symptoms persist):** One tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime.
* **Day 4 (if symptoms still persist):** One tablet in the morning, one tablet in the mid-afternoon, and two tablets at bedtime.  The maximum daily dose is four tablets (Doxylamine 40mg + Pyridoxine 40mg).

**Extended-Release Formulation (Doxylamine 20mg + Pyridoxine 20mg):**

* **Day 1:** One tablet at bedtime.
* **Day 2 (if symptoms persist):** One tablet in the morning and one tablet at bedtime.
* The maximum daily dose is two tablets (Doxylamine 40mg + Pyridoxine 40mg).

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of this medication in children under 18 years of age haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance if you have liver or kidney disease.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Palpitations

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism by which doxylamine and pyridoxine alleviate nausea and vomiting in pregnancy isn't completely clear. Doxylamine's antihistamine properties likely play a role by blocking histamine receptors and affecting the brain's chemoreceptor trigger zone (which regulates vomiting). Pyridoxine, a crucial vitamin, is involved in various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of neurotransmitters that may influence nausea and vomiting.  The combination of these two active components seems to be more effective than either alone in managing pregnancy-related nausea.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to doxylamine, pyridoxine, or any of the inactive ingredients, those concurrently using MAO inhibitors, and those with conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcers, pyloroduodenal obstruction, or bladder neck obstruction.  Individuals at risk for asthma attacks should also exercise caution.
* **Interactions:** Avoid alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.) while taking this medication as the effects could be additive and increase drowsiness.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This combination is intended for use during pregnancy to manage nausea and vomiting.  However, doxylamine is expected to pass into breast milk and pyridoxine is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with asthma, urinary bladder neck obstruction, increased intraocular pressure or angle-closure glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcers, or pyloroduodenal obstruction.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before starting this medication.  Certain interactions can occur.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep out of the reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
