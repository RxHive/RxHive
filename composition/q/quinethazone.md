# Quinethazone
### Generic Name
Quinethazone

### Usage
Quinethazone is a thiazide diuretic primarily used as an adjunct in treating hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (fluid retention).  Edema can be a symptom of various conditions, including congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and kidney failure.  Quinethazone helps to reduce fluid buildup by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body.  It's important to understand that Quinethazone is usually used *in addition* to other medications, not as a standalone treatment for these conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension (as an adjunct):** The initial oral dose is typically 25-100 mg per day. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg.
* **Edema (as an adjunct):** The initial oral dose is also typically 25-100 mg per day, with a maximum of 200 mg daily.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Quinethazone in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment.  Use should be cautious in this population.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):** Quinethazone is contraindicated in patients with anuria (absence of urine production).  Patients with significant kidney failure often don't respond well to thiazide diuretics and should generally avoid this medication.  It's generally not recommended if serum creatinine or BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels are above 2.5 mg/dL.

The medication is typically administered orally as a tablet.  Specific dosing should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Vertigo
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Headache
* Xanthopsia (yellowish vision)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Skin rashes (purpura, urticaria)
* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation)
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia - low potassium; hyponatremia - low sodium; hypercalcemia - high calcium)
* Increased blood sugar levels

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Necrotizing angiitis (inflammation of blood vessels)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Hip fracture (increased risk, especially in older adults)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Quinethazone is a thiazide diuretic. It works in the kidneys by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the distal convoluted tubule.  This means that more sodium and chloride are excreted in the urine, along with water.  By increasing urine production, Quinethazone helps to lower blood pressure and reduce edema.  The resulting decrease in blood volume contributes to the blood pressure-lowering effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Quinethazone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and in those with anuria (absence of urine production).
* **Interactions:** Quinethazone can interact with many other medications.  It may decrease the effectiveness of anticoagulants, antigout agents, and sulfonylureas.  It can also increase the toxicity of several other medications, including lithium, digitalis, and some muscle relaxants.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions before taking Quinethazone.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia), hepatic impairment, hyperuricemia (high uric acid), systemic lupus erythematosus, and diabetes mellitus.  Monitor electrolytes and blood sugar regularly if taking Quinethazone.  It is a Category C drug in pregnancy (potential risk to the fetus), and its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully considered.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Quinethazone to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but it usually takes several days to see the full therapeutic effect.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Quinethazone suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Quinethazone abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping suddenly can lead to rebound effects, including a sudden increase in blood pressure.

* **Q: How should I store Quinethazone?** A: Store Quinethazone at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking Quinethazone?** A: Alcohol can interact with Quinethazone and increase the risk of dehydration and low blood pressure.  Limit alcohol consumption while on this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
