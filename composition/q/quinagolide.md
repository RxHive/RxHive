# Quinagolide
### Generic Name
Quinagolide

### Usage
Quinagolide is primarily used to treat hyperprolactinemia, a condition characterized by abnormally high levels of prolactin in the blood.  This hyperprolactinemia can be idiopathic (of unknown cause) or result from a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma (a benign tumor in the pituitary gland).  The high prolactin levels can lead to various symptoms, including menstrual irregularities in women, infertility in both men and women, decreased libido, and galactorrhea (spontaneous breast milk production).  While not a primary indication, it may also help restore fertility in some cases of hyperprolactinemia-induced infertility.

### Dosage

**Adults (Hyperprolactinemia):**  Quinagolide is administered orally.  A typical starting regimen involves a low initial dose: 0.025 mg once daily for 3 days, followed by 0.05 mg once daily for another 3 days (this is often provided as a starter pack). Maintenance therapy usually begins on day 7 with 0.075 mg once daily.  The dose may be gradually increased in increments of 0.075-0.15 mg/day at intervals of at least one week, up to a maximum of 0.9 mg/day. The usual maintenance dose ranges from 0.075 to 0.15 mg/day.  Dose adjustments should be made at intervals of at least four weeks when exceeding 0.15mg/day.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of quinagolide in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Quinagolide is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works

Quinagolide is a dopamine D2 receptor agonist.  This means it binds to and activates dopamine D2 receptors in the pituitary gland.  The pituitary gland contains cells called lactotrophs, which produce and release prolactin. By activating these D2 receptors, quinagolide inhibits the release of prolactin, thereby reducing the elevated prolactin levels characteristic of hyperprolactinemia.  It's important to note that quinagolide is not an ergot alkaloid, a different class of drugs sometimes used to treat hyperprolactinemia.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Quinagolide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or its components, and in those with hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Quinagolide may interact with alcohol (increasing the risk of CNS depression), antipsychotic agents (reducing quinagolide's effectiveness), amisulpride, metoclopramide, pipamperone, and sulpiride (affecting the effectiveness of either drug). It can also potentiate the hypotensive effects of blood pressure-lowering medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of quinagolide during pregnancy is unknown.  It should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed unless medically necessary to continue.  It's not recommended during breastfeeding because its excretion in breast milk is unknown and it can suppress lactation. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should be cautioned about activities requiring mental alertness (e.g., driving or operating machinery) due to potential CNS side effects like dizziness and sedation.  The treatment may not eliminate the need for radiation or surgical intervention for pituitary adenomas, depending on the individual case.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take quinagolide with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions can occur.

* **Q: How should I store quinagolide?** A: Store quinagolide as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses; do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking quinagolide abruptly?** A: No, you should not stop taking quinagolide abruptly.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for discontinuation, as sudden cessation can sometimes lead to a rebound increase in prolactin levels.

* **Q:  Will quinagolide cure my hyperprolactinemia?** A: Quinagolide manages the symptoms of hyperprolactinemia by lowering prolactin levels. Whether it completely resolves the underlying cause depends on the cause of hyperprolactinemia itself.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of quinagolide?** A: Long-term effects vary depending on the individual and the duration of treatment. Regular monitoring by your physician is essential to assess for any potential long-term side effects and adjust treatment accordingly.
