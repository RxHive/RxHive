# Quifenadine
### Generic Name
Quifenadine

### Usage
Quifenadine is a second-generation antihistamine primarily used to alleviate symptoms associated with various allergic conditions.  Its main applications include treating pollinosis (hay fever), acute and chronic urticaria (hives), allergic rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages), allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva in the eye), angioedema (swelling under the skin), dermatoses (skin conditions), eczema, neurodermatitis, itching, and allergic reactions triggered by food or medications.  Essentially, it targets the symptoms caused by histamine release in the body.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** For acute and chronic urticaria, seasonal rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and dermatoses, the oral dosage is typically 25-50 mg, 2-4 times daily. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg.  Treatment usually lasts 10-20 days, with potential for course repetition if needed.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children varies significantly with age:

* **Children aged 2-3 years:** 5 mg, 2-3 times a day for 10-15 days. Repeat the course if necessary.
* **Children aged 3-7 years:** 10 mg twice daily after meals for 10-15 days. Repeat the course if necessary.
* **Children aged 7-12 years:** 10-15 mg, 2-3 times a day after meals for 10-15 days. Repeat the course if necessary.
* **Children 12 years and older/Adolescents:** 25 mg, 2-3 times a day for 10-15 days.  The course may be repeated if needed.

**Important Note:**  Always follow the specific dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  The information above is for general guidance only.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, though the frequency isn't specifically defined, may include:

* Headache
* Somnolence (sleepiness)
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Vomiting

While less common, more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Quifenadine works by blocking histamine H1-receptors in peripheral tissues.  Histamine is a chemical released during allergic reactions, causing inflammation and symptoms like itching and swelling. By blocking these receptors, Quifenadine prevents histamine from binding and triggering these reactions.  Additionally, it activates the enzyme diaminoxidase (histaminase), which helps break down histamine, further reducing its effects.  Quifenadine also exhibits mild antiserotonin and anticholinergic activity, contributing to its overall effect on allergic symptoms.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Quifenadine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to quifenadine or any of its components, fructose intolerance, during the first three months of pregnancy (and is not recommended during other periods of pregnancy), and while breastfeeding.

**Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using quifenadine in patients with cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, or renal or hepatic (liver and kidney) impairment.

**Other Warnings:**  Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if drowsiness occurs.  Quifenadine should be taken after meals.
