# Quinapril

**Generic Name:** Quinapril

**Usage:**

Quinapril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat:

* **Hypertension (high blood pressure):**  It helps lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.
* **Heart failure:** It can improve symptoms and survival in patients with heart failure.  It's often used in combination with other heart failure medications.


**Side Effects:**

Quinapril, like other ACE inhibitors, can cause several side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  Some common side effects include:

* **Dry, persistent cough:** This is a relatively common and sometimes bothersome side effect.
* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** Especially when standing up quickly (orthostatic hypotension).
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Diarrhea or constipation:**
* **Muscle cramps:**
* **Rash:**
* **Changes in taste:**


**More serious, but less common, side effects include:**

* **Angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Hyperkalemia:** High levels of potassium in the blood.  This is particularly concerning for patients with kidney problems.
* **Hypotension:** Low blood pressure.
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:** Although rare.
* **Neutropenia:** A decrease in white blood cells.


**How it Works:**

Quinapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  ACE is an enzyme that plays a role in raising blood pressure by causing blood vessels to narrow.  By inhibiting ACE, quinapril prevents the formation of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels). This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and improving heart function.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking quinapril?**  Alcohol can enhance the hypotensive (blood pressure lowering) effects of quinapril, increasing the risk of dizziness or fainting.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Can I take quinapril with other medications?**  Quinapril can interact with several other medications, including potassium supplements, diuretics (water pills), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs of an allergic reaction include rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.

* **Can I stop taking quinapril suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking quinapril suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound effect, causing a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor will gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue the medication.

* **Is quinapril safe during pregnancy?** ACE inhibitors are generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, due to potential harm to the developing fetus.  Discuss your options with your doctor if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
