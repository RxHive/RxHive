# Quinapril
### Generic Name
Quinapril

### Usage
Quinapril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It's also used as an add-on treatment for heart failure, improving the effectiveness of other heart failure medications.  While not officially approved for this purpose by regulatory bodies, Quinapril is sometimes used off-label to treat diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease related to diabetes).  The use in these secondary applications should always be under the direct guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):**

* **Adults:** The starting dose is typically 10-20 mg once daily.  This can be increased gradually, as needed and directed by a doctor, up to a maximum of 80 mg daily, given in one or two divided doses.  The increase should be done every two weeks. If the patient is also taking a diuretic (water pill), the doctor might start with a lower dose (5mg once daily) and consider stopping the diuretic a few days before starting Quinapril.
* **Children and Adolescents:**  The safety and effectiveness of Quinapril in children and adolescents have not been established.  Use in this population should only be considered under close medical supervision and is generally considered off-label. If used, the starting dose may range from 5-10mg once daily, with careful titration (gradual increase) as directed by a physician.

**Heart Failure:**

* **Adults:**  The usual starting dose is 5 mg twice daily.  This dose is carefully increased in weekly intervals, as directed by the physician, to reach a target of 20 mg twice daily, or a maximum of 40mg daily, depending on the patient's response.


**Diabetic Nephropathy (Off-label Use):**

* **Adults:** The initial dosage typically starts between 10-20 mg daily and can be adjusted to 20-80mg daily, split into one or two doses, based on individual responses and under strict medical supervision.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on kidney function (creatinine clearance). Individuals with impaired kidney function require lower starting doses and potentially slower increases in dosage.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your specific needs and health status.  There are no specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment listed in manufacturer's guidelines.  Always consult with a doctor to determine proper dosage.  The medication is available in tablet form.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Cough (dry)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
*  Acute renal failure
*  Agranulocytosis (severe drop in white blood cells)
*  Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
*  Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)

If any of these side effects occur, especially angioedema, seek immediate medical attention.  Any other concerning side effects should be reported to your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Quinapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  ACE is an enzyme that helps the body produce angiotensin II, a substance that narrows blood vessels, raising blood pressure. By blocking ACE, Quinapril prevents the formation of angiotensin II, causing blood vessels to relax and widen, thus lowering blood pressure.  It also reduces the amount of aldosterone, a hormone that retains sodium and water in the body, further contributing to blood pressure reduction.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Quinapril is categorized as a pregnancy Category C in the first trimester and Category D in the second and third trimesters.  It can cause serious harm or even death to a developing fetus.  It should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is detected. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception.
* **Breastfeeding:** Quinapril is excreted in breast milk; therefore, its use while breastfeeding should be carefully considered, and only done under medical supervision.
* **Kidney Problems:**  Individuals with kidney problems should be closely monitored, and may require a lower starting dose.
* **Liver Problems:** Though no specific dosage adjustments exist, those with liver impairment may need careful monitoring.
* **Other Medications:** Quinapril can interact with other medications, including diuretics, potassium supplements, and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Do not take Quinapril if you have a history of angioedema (swelling) related to previous ACE inhibitor use.
* **Surgery:** Discuss Quinapril use with your surgeon before any major surgery.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Quinapril?**  A:  It's generally advised to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking Quinapril, as it can worsen the hypotensive (low blood pressure) effects.

* **Q: How should I store Quinapril?** A: Store Quinapril in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Quinapril suddenly?** A: No, stopping Quinapril suddenly can be harmful. Always consult your doctor before stopping or altering your medication regimen.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience swelling?** A: Swelling, particularly in the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema) is a serious side effect. Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
