# Quinacrine
### Generic Name
Quinacrine

### Usage
Quinacrine, also known as mepacrine, is primarily used as an anthelmintic (anti-worm) medication, particularly effective against *Giardia lamblia*, the parasite causing giardiasis.  It was historically used as an antimalarial drug but has been largely replaced by more effective and better-tolerated alternatives like chloroquine.  Quinacrine also has a role in treating lupus erythematosus, though its use in this context is less common now.  It's important to note that the use of quinacrine for female sterilization (transcervically) is illegal and prohibited in many regions, including India.

### Dosage

**Giardiasis:**

* **Adults:** 100 mg three times daily (TID) for 5-7 days.
* **Children:** 2 mg/kg body weight TID for 5-7 days, not exceeding a maximum daily dose of 300 mg.

**Lupus Erythematosus:**

* **Adults:** Initial dose: 100 mg daily (OD) for the first 1-2 months. Maintenance dose: 25-50 mg OD,  occasionally increased to 100-200 mg OD as needed.  The dose may be reduced by 50% if significant gastrointestinal side effects occur.
* **Children:** 1-2 mg/kg body weight daily, up to a maximum of 100 mg daily.

**Note:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and the severity of the condition.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional.  Quinacrine is typically administered orally, after meals to minimize gastrointestinal upset.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, yellow discoloration of skin, urine, and conjunctiva (often reversible).  Blue-black discoloration of the palate and nails can also occur.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Psychosis, central nervous system stimulation, convulsions, ocular toxicity, chronic dermatoses, liver toxicity, and aplastic anemia.

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Quinacrine's mechanism of action involves binding to DNA, interfering with the transcription and translation processes essential for parasite and cell function.  In *Giardia*, this disrupts the parasite's ability to survive and reproduce.  In lupus erythematosus, quinacrine's effects are thought to stem from its inhibition of succinate oxidation, disruption of electron transport, and binding to nucleoproteins, leading to a reduction in the inflammatory response.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Quinacrine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to quinacrine or its components and those with psoriasis.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with CYP450 2D6 inhibitors (which may increase thioridazine levels), deferiprone (increased risk of hematologic toxicity), or auranofin (increased risk of blood disorders) should be avoided.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in elderly patients, those with a history of psychosis, hepatic disease, or porphyria, and during pregnancy and lactation.  Quinacrine crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.  Bone marrow suppression and central nervous system stimulation are potential risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for quinacrine to work?**  A: The timeframe for symptom improvement varies depending on the condition and individual response. For giardiasis, improvement is often seen within a few days of treatment.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store quinacrine?** A: Store quinacrine at room temperature, away from light and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: Is quinacrine safe during pregnancy?** A:  Quinacrine use during pregnancy should be approached with caution and only under strict medical supervision due to its potential effects on the fetus.  It's generally recommended to postpone treatment for asymptomatic pregnant women until after delivery.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking quinacrine?** A: Alcohol may exacerbate potential side effects.  Itâ€™s best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.  Always consult your doctor before combining any medications with alcohol.
