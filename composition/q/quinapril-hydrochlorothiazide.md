# Quinapril + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Quinapril Hydrochloride/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**

Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines an ACE inhibitor (quinapril) and a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide).  The ACE inhibitor helps relax blood vessels, while the diuretic helps the body get rid of excess salt and water, both of which lower blood pressure.  This combination is often prescribed when a single medication is not effective enough to control blood pressure.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Dizziness:** Often occurs initially and usually subsides with continued use.
* **Lightheadedness:** Related to dizziness and low blood pressure.
* **Dry cough:** A characteristic side effect of ACE inhibitors.  If severe, consult your doctor.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**  Can be mild to moderate.
* **Muscle cramps:** Due to electrolyte imbalances.
* **Nausea:**  Upset stomach.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Increased urination:**  Especially noticeable at the beginning of treatment.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat – seek immediate medical attention. This is a serious allergic reaction.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):** Can be dangerous.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Kidney problems:** Impaired kidney function.
* **Liver problems:**  Jaundice or other liver abnormalities.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rashes, itching, hives.


**How it Works:**

Quinapril is an ACE inhibitor that blocks the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, quinapril helps relax and widen blood vessels, reducing blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. This reduces blood volume and consequently lowers blood pressure.  The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide with other medications?**  You should inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications, such as potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics, can increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Mild side effects may subside with continued use.  If side effects are severe or persistent, contact your doctor. Seek immediate medical attention for angioedema.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure further, potentially causing excessive hypotension. Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Can I stop taking Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide suddenly?** No, you should gradually reduce the dosage under your doctor’s supervision to avoid potential rebound hypertension.
* **Is Quinapril/Hydrochlorothiazide right for me?** This is a decision to be made with your doctor, considering your overall health, other medical conditions, and other medications you are taking.
