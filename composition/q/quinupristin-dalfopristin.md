# Quinupristin + Dalfopristin
### Generic Name
Quinupristin/Dalfopristin

### Usage

Quinupristin/Dalfopristin is a combination antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections. Its primary use is in treating infections caused by *Enterococcus faecium* that are resistant to vancomycin, a common antibiotic.  This is a particularly challenging type of infection because of the limited treatment options.  It also has a role in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by bacteria such as methicillin-susceptible *Staphylococcus aureus* (MSSA) or *Streptococcus pyogenes*.  These are infections that extend beyond the skin's surface, often involving deeper tissues.


### Dosage

Quinupristin/Dalfopristin is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage is calculated based on a patient's weight in kilograms (kg).

**Adults:**

* **Vancomycin-resistant *Enterococcus faecium* infection:** The usual dose is 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours. The total duration of treatment varies depending on the infection's severity and location and is determined by the prescribing physician.
* **Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI):** The typical dose is 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Again, the duration is determined by the physician based on the individual patient's response to treatment.

**Children:**

The safety and effectiveness of Quinupristin/Dalfopristin have not been established in children under 16 years of age. For those 16 and older, the adult dosage is used.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  However, for those with severe hepatic impairment (cirrhosis), caution is advised, and dose reduction may be necessary, although the specific adjustments are not defined in current guidelines.

**Administration:**  The intravenous infusion should be given over 60 minutes.  The infusion line needs to be flushed with dextrose 5% in water (D5W) before and after administration to minimize vein irritation.  Saline or heparin solutions should *not* be used for flushing. If significant irritation occurs, consider diluting the medication further or using a central venous catheter.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** (Occurring in more than 10% of patients)

* Elevated bilirubin levels (hyperbilirubinemia)
* Pain and inflammation at the injection site
* Joint pain (arthralgia) and muscle pain (myalgia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  (Occurring in less than 10% of patients, but warrant medical attention):

* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Headache
* Skin rash and itching (pruritus)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Anemia
* Increased levels of liver enzymes
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe)

Many other side effects have been reported, although less frequently,  in post-marketing surveillance.  These range from relatively minor issues to more serious events.  Consult a healthcare professional immediately if any unexpected or concerning side effects develop.


### How it Works

Quinupristin/Dalfopristin is a synergistic combination of two antibiotics that work together to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis.  They bind to different sites on the 50S ribosomal subunit, a crucial component of bacterial protein production.  By interfering with this process, the bacteria are unable to produce essential proteins, leading to their death and resolution of the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Quinupristin/Dalfopristin should not be used in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to quinupristin, dalfopristin, other streptogramin antibiotics (like pristinamycin or virginiamycin), or any component of the medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.  Specifically, there's increased risk of heart rhythm problems (ventricular arrhythmias) when used with drugs that prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Also, Quinupristin/Dalfopristin may increase the blood levels of drugs such as cyclosporine, nifedipine, midazolam, and tacrolimus, potentially leading to increased side effects from these medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Quinupristin/Dalfopristin is categorized as Pregnancy Category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking. Use during pregnancy should be considered only when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk, therefore caution is advised in breastfeeding women.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Patients with liver or kidney problems require careful monitoring during treatment, and dose adjustments may be necessary for those with severe liver disease.
* **Other Warnings:**  This antibiotic can increase the risk of *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection) and other superinfections (new infections occurring alongside the original infection).

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time to see improvement varies based on the infection's severity and the individual patient's response.  Improvement should be observed within a few days, but a full course of treatment is usually necessary for complete resolution.

* **Q: Can I take Quinupristin/Dalfopristin with other medications?** A: Discuss all medications you are taking (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies) with your healthcare provider before starting Quinupristin/Dalfopristin.  Some interactions can be dangerous.

* **Q: How should I store Quinupristin/Dalfopristin?** A: This medication is administered intravenously in a healthcare setting and does not require home storage.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you miss a dose.  Do not attempt to adjust the schedule without professional guidance.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking this medication?** A: No specific dietary restrictions are typically associated with Quinupristin/Dalfopristin. However, it's always a good practice to maintain a healthy diet while undergoing medical treatment.
