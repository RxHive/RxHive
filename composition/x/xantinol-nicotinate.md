# Xantinol Nicotinate
### Generic Name
Xantinol Nicotinate

### Usage
Xantinol nicotinate is primarily used to improve blood flow in the brain and peripheral tissues.  This makes it useful in treating cerebrovascular disorders (conditions affecting blood vessels in the brain) and peripheral vascular diseases (conditions affecting blood vessels in the limbs and other parts of the body).  It's believed to achieve this by acting as a peripheral vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels.  The improved blood flow is thought to help alleviate symptoms associated with these conditions.  Note that its use is largely based on its historical application and further research is needed to fully establish its efficacy in these conditions.


### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical oral dose for cerebrovascular disorders and peripheral vascular disease is 3 grams per day.  This is usually divided into several doses throughout the day, but the exact schedule should be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of xantinol nicotinate in children have not been established, and it's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  It is crucial to consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Flushing (reddening of the skin)
* Generalized itching
* Rash
* Abdominal pain
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)

Less common but more serious side effects are possible.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Xantinol nicotinate works primarily as a vasodilator, meaning it helps to relax and widen blood vessels. This improved blood flow can increase the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain and peripheral tissues.  It is also thought to improve brain glucose metabolism, leading to increased brain energy levels. While the precise mechanisms are not completely understood,  these effects are believed to contribute to its potential benefits in treating cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disorders.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Xantinol nicotinate is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to xantinol nicotinate or any of its components
* Severe hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Pregnancy
* Recent myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Recent cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Severely compromised cardiac function


**Use with Caution:**  Xantinol nicotinate should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Mitral stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve in the heart)
* Labile blood pressure (blood pressure that fluctuates significantly)
* Active peptic ulceration (ulcers in the stomach or duodenum)
* Cardiac insufficiency (heart failure)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs)
* Oliguria or anuria (reduced or absent urine production)
* Elderly patients


**Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use of xantinol nicotinate with ganglion blockers and sympatholytic agents should be avoided as it may lead to additive effects.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
