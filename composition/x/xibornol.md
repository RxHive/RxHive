# Xibornol
### Generic Name
Xibornol

### Usage
Xibornol is an antibacterial agent used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of susceptible oral infections.  This includes conditions such as pharyngitis (sore throat), laryngitis (inflammation of the voice box), nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat), acute tonsillitis (sudden inflammation of the tonsils), and chronic tonsillitis (long-term inflammation of the tonsils).  It's important to note that Xibornol is used *in addition to* other treatments, not as a standalone cure for these infections.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage for adults with susceptible oral infections is 4-6 pharyngeal sprays per day using the 3% aqueous suspension for spray.  Sprays should be administered at regular intervals throughout the day.  Specific instructions for administration are provided below in the General Considerations section.  Dosage information for children is not provided in the available data.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, although the frequency is not specified, include:

* Diarrhea
* Skin rash

While rare, serious side effects are possible.  It is crucial to seek medical attention immediately if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works
Xibornol exhibits a bacteriostatic effect, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria. It primarily targets gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococci and streptococci. It also demonstrates activity against *Haemophilus influenzae*.  By suppressing bacterial growth, Xibornol helps the body's natural defenses to combat the infection more effectively.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Xibornol or any of its components.
* Pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding.

**Warnings:**

* Avoid use in patients with allergic asthma.
*  The provided information does not include dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a physician for guidance in these cases.


### FAQs

**Q: How do I use the Xibornol spray?**

A: Lift the spout of the bottle and direct the jet towards the affected area, keeping the bottle vertical. Shake the bottle well before each use. For the first use, press the pump three times to prime it.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. In that case, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Do not double the dose.

**Q: Is Xibornol a cure for oral infections?**

A: No, Xibornol is an adjunctive therapy, meaning it works best in combination with other treatments to manage susceptible oral infections.  It helps to control bacterial growth but doesn't eliminate the underlying infection on its own.

**Q:  Are there any interactions with other medications?**

A: The provided information does not detail specific drug interactions.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.
