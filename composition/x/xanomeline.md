# Xanomeline
### Generic Name
Xanomeline

### Usage
Xanomeline is a medication that was investigated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, primarily targeting cognitive deficits (memory problems, difficulty thinking) and negative symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal) in schizophrenia.  While showing some promise in improving cognitive function in certain studies, its development has been hampered by significant side effects.  It's important to note that Xanomeline is not currently approved for widespread clinical use.

### Dosage
There is no established, approved dosage for Xanomeline for human use because it is not currently approved for market.  The dosages used in clinical trials varied considerably depending on the study's design and the specific formulation (e.g., oral, transdermal patch). Any dosage information should only be obtained from a clinical trial publication and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.

### Side Effects
Common side effects reported in clinical trials included:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Increased salivation
* Sweating

Less common but serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, were also observed in some studies.  The exact nature and frequency of these serious adverse events would need to be determined from specific clinical trial data.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works
Xanomeline primarily works by acting as an agonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly the M1 and M4 subtypes.  These receptors are involved in various brain functions, including memory, learning, and cognitive processing. By stimulating these receptors, Xanomeline may potentially improve cognitive function.  However, its interaction with other muscarinic receptors, such as acting as an antagonist at the M5 receptor, complicates its mechanism and likely contributes to some side effects.  The rapid metabolism of Xanomeline into a less selective metabolite also contributed to difficulties in achieving a therapeutic window.

### Precautions
Because Xanomeline is not approved for market, detailed precautions specific to a commercial formulation are unavailable. However, based on clinical trial data, it's crucial to highlight the following:

* **Contraindications:**  Specific contraindications were not clearly defined in completed research, but individuals with a history of serious gastrointestinal problems or hypersensitivity to Xanomeline should be cautious.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The potential for drug interactions with other medications is unknown and requires careful consideration should research continue.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Xanomeline during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  It should not be used during these periods unless explicitly advised by a physician involved in a relevant clinical trial.
* **Older Adults and Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Xanomeline in older adults and children have not been established.


### FAQs
