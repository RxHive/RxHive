# Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine, Inactivated Adsorbed
### Generic Name
Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine, Inactivated Adsorbed

### Usage
Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine, Inactivated Adsorbed is used for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis (JE).  This vaccine is recommended for individuals 2 months of age and older who are at increased risk of contracting the virus, primarily through mosquito bites.  This risk is heightened during travel to regions of Asia where JE is endemic.  The vaccine aims to prevent the disease, not treat it once contracted.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥17 years):**

* **Primary Immunization:** Two 0.5 mL doses administered intramuscularly (IM) 28 days apart.
* **Booster Dose:** A booster dose may be considered if the primary series was administered more than one year prior to potential re-exposure to the virus.  Ideally, the full immunization course should be completed at least one week before potential exposure.

**Children (2 months to <17 years):**

* **Primary Immunization (2 months to <3 years):** Two 0.25 mL doses administered IM 28 days apart.
* **Primary Immunization (≥3 years):** Two 0.5 mL doses administered IM 28 days apart.
* **Booster Dose:** The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose in children under 17 have not been fully evaluated.  Complete immunization should ideally be completed at least one week before potential exposure.

**Infants (<2 months):** The safety and efficacy of this vaccine have not been established in infants under 2 months old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for individuals with renal or hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common (>10%):** Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), headache, muscle aches (myalgia), flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, fatigue), and general fatigue.
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Erythema (redness) at the injection site, nausea.
* **Serious (Less Common):** While rare, anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, hives).

**Important Note:** This list does not include all possible side effects.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after receiving the vaccine, consult your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

The Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine, Inactivated Adsorbed works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the Japanese encephalitis virus.  The inactivated virus in the vaccine is not capable of causing disease but triggers the immune response, preparing the body to fight off a real infection if encountered later.  This process of creating immunity is known as active immunization, resulting in long-lasting protection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine, any other JE vaccine, or any component of the vaccine (including protamine sulfate). It's also contraindicated in individuals with acute severe febrile illnesses.
* **Warnings:** There is a risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions and bleeding disorders.  Use with caution in severely immunocompromised patients.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** This vaccine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. While the excretion of the vaccine in breast milk is unknown, it should be used with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with certain immunosuppressants (e.g., belimumab, fingolimod, venetoclax) may diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine.  Consult your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection last?**  A: The duration of protection varies depending on individual factors.  A booster dose may be recommended depending on the risk of re-exposure.

* **Q: Can I get Japanese encephalitis from the vaccine?** A: No, the virus in the vaccine is inactivated and cannot cause the disease.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: Is this vaccine suitable for all ages?** A: No, it's recommended for individuals 2 months and older.  Safety and efficacy have not been established for infants younger than 2 months.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer. Typically, this involves refrigeration.

* **Q: Should I avoid certain activities after vaccination?** A:  Observe for 30 minutes post-vaccination for any adverse reactions.  Otherwise, there aren't specific activity restrictions.  However, continue to practice mosquito bite prevention measures in endemic areas.
