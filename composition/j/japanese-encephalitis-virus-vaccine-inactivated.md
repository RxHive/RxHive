### Generic Name
Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine (Inactivated)

### Usage
The Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine (inactivated) is used to actively immunize individuals against diseases caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus.  This vaccine is indicated for patients aged 2 months and older.  Its primary use is preventing Japanese encephalitis, a serious viral infection affecting the brain.  There are no notable secondary uses beyond this primary preventative function.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage and scheduling information provided here is for general knowledge and should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  The following reflects guidelines from the ACIP/CDC but may vary based on specific product labeling.

**Adults (≤65 years):**

* **Primary Immunization:** Two 0.5 mL doses administered intramuscularly (IM) on days 0 and 7 to 28.  The series must be completed at least one week before potential exposure.
* **Booster Dose:** A single 0.5 mL booster dose is given at least one year after completing the primary series if ongoing or expected exposure to the virus continues.  This is administered IM.

**Children:**

* **Infants (2 months to ≤35 months):** Two 0.25 mL doses administered IM on days 0 and 28. The series must be completed at least one week before potential exposure.
* **Children (≥36 months) and Adolescents (≤17 years):** Two 0.5 mL doses administered IM on days 0 and 28.  The series must be completed at least one week before potential exposure.
* **Adolescents (≥18 years):**  Follow adult dosage guidelines.
* **Booster Doses (all children):** A 0.25 mL (children <3 years) or 0.5 mL (children ≥3 years) booster dose is administered IM at least one year after the primary series if ongoing or expected exposure continues.


**Administration:**  The preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle.  Patients should be seated or lying down during administration to mitigate the risk of syncope (fainting).  The vaccine should be shaken well before use to ensure a homogeneous suspension.  Do not use if discolored or if particulate matter remains.  Use separate needles and syringes for each injection and do not mix with other vaccines.

### How it Works

The Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine (inactivated) contains killed Japanese encephalitis virus.  When injected, this inactive virus triggers an immune response in the body. The body produces antibodies that recognize and neutralize the Japanese encephalitis virus, providing protection against future infection.  The onset of protection is relatively slow, but the immunity provided is long-lasting.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of Japanese encephalitis vaccine (inactivated), any other Japanese encephalitis vaccine, or any component of the vaccine (including protamine sulfate).
* Acute severe febrile illness.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, bleeding disorders, shoulder injury related to vaccine administration, and syncope.
* Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia), those receiving anticoagulant therapy, and severely immunocompromised individuals.
*  The vaccine should not be mixed with other vaccines or injections.


**Drug Interactions:**  The efficacy of the vaccine may be reduced when administered concurrently with certain medications including: belimumab, fingolimod, immunosuppressants (exceptions may apply – consult your doctor), and venetoclax.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of this vaccine during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  The decision to vaccinate pregnant or breastfeeding individuals should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, weighing the risks and benefits.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for the vaccine to be effective?**  A: The onset of protection is relatively slow, but immunity is long-lasting.  The full course of vaccination should be completed at least one week before potential exposure for optimal protection.

* **Q: Can I get Japanese encephalitis even after getting the vaccine?** A: While the vaccine is highly effective, it does not guarantee 100% protection.  There's a small chance you might still contract the disease, but the vaccine significantly reduces the severity and likelihood of the infection.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.  Generally, vaccines should be refrigerated.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

* **Q: Is this vaccine safe for everyone?** A:  While generally safe and well-tolerated, certain individuals should not receive the vaccine (contraindicated).  It's essential to discuss your health history with your doctor to determine if the vaccine is appropriate for you.
