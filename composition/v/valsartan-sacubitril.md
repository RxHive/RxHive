# Valsartan + Sacubitril
### Generic Name
Valsartan + Sacubitril

### Usage
Valsartan and Sacubitril is a combination medication used primarily to treat chronic heart failure in adults.  Its main purpose is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization in patients with this condition.  It's particularly beneficial for patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), meaning their heart isn't pumping blood as efficiently as it should.  The combination is also being explored and used in some cases for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), although the evidence base may be smaller compared to HFrEF.  In pediatric patients (aged 1 year and older), it's used to treat symptomatic heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's prior use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and their current heart failure status (HFrEF or HFpEF).  Always follow the prescribed dosage regimen provided by a healthcare professional. It's crucial to note that concomitant use of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated; a 36-hour washout period is necessary when switching between an ACE inhibitor and this combination therapy.

* **HFrEF:**
    * **Prior moderate-to-high ACE inhibitor/ARB use:** Start with Valsartan 51 mg/Sacubitril 49 mg twice daily (BID). After 2-4 weeks, increase to Valsartan 103 mg/Sacubitril 97 mg BID as tolerated.
    * **Prior low-dose ACE inhibitor/ARB use or no prior use:** Start with Valsartan 26 mg/Sacubitril 24 mg BID.  Double the dose every 2-4 weeks as tolerated, up to the target maintenance dose of Valsartan 103 mg/Sacubitril 97 mg BID.
* **HFpEF:**
    * Initial dose is either Valsartan 26 mg/Sacubitril 24 mg BID or Valsartan 51 mg/Sacubitril 49 mg BID, depending on baseline blood pressure. The dose is doubled after approximately two weeks to the target maintenance dose of Valsartan 103 mg/Sacubitril 97 mg BID.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 1 year old.  Dosage depends on the child's weight and prior ACE inhibitor/ARB use.  Both oral suspension and tablets are available. The dosage instructions are complex and require careful adherence to the prescription.  Consult your pediatrician for specific guidance.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Increased serum creatinine (indicator of kidney function)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, but warrant immediate medical attention):**

* Dizziness
* Falling
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin (indicating anemia)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Acute kidney injury
* Renal failure syndrome
* Cough


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Valsartan + Sacubitril works through a two-pronged mechanism.  Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), preventing the hormone angiotensin II from binding to its receptors. This reduces blood vessel constriction, lowering blood pressure and easing the strain on the heart. Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor; its active metabolite blocks the enzyme neprilysin, which normally breaks down beneficial peptides like natriuretic peptides.  Increased levels of these peptides promote vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reduce fluid retention, and lower blood pressure, further improving heart function.  The combined effect of these two mechanisms improves cardiac output and reduces the burden on the heart, ultimately improving the symptoms and prognosis of heart failure.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Valsartan + Sacubitril is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitors or ARBs, hypersensitivity to Valsartan, Sacubitril or any components of the formulation, concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, concomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²), recent symptomatic hypotension before treatment initiation, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:**  Simultaneous use with ACE inhibitors is strictly prohibited due to a heightened risk of angioedema.  Interactions with other medications, including lithium, insulin, and NSAIDs, require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments.
* **Warnings:**  Valsartan + Sacubitril can cause fetal harm; immediate discontinuation is necessary if pregnancy occurs.  Patients with impaired kidney function, especially those with low renal blood flow, require close monitoring.  Risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension is increased.  Use caution in patients with significant aortic or mitral stenosis, pre-existing renal insufficiency or hyperkalemia, or moderate hepatic impairment.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Valsartan + Sacubitril with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications can interact negatively with Valsartan + Sacubitril, necessitating adjustments or contraindications.

* **How should I store Valsartan + Sacubitril?** Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Follow specific storage instructions on the product label.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **What are the long-term effects of Valsartan + Sacubitril?** Long-term studies have shown benefits in reducing cardiovascular death and hospitalization in heart failure patients, but individual responses vary. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.

* **Is Valsartan + Sacubitril safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** No, it's contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
