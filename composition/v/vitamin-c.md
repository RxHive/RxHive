# Vitamin C
### Generic Name
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)

### Usage
Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin essential for numerous bodily functions.  Its primary use is to prevent and treat scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency.  This deficiency leads to fatigue, weakness, and bleeding gums.  Beyond preventing scurvy, Vitamin C plays a crucial role in:

* **Collagen synthesis:**  Vitamin C is vital for the production of collagen, a protein forming the basis of connective tissues in skin, bones, tendons, and ligaments.  This supports wound healing and maintains healthy skin and joints.
* **Immune system support:**  It acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals, and boosts the immune system's function.  While not a cure for colds, some studies suggest it might slightly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms.
* **Iron absorption:** Vitamin C enhances the absorption of non-heme iron (found in plant-based foods), improving iron levels in the body.


### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for Vitamin C vary depending on age, health status, and individual needs.  It's always best to consult a doctor or registered dietitian for personalized advice.  General guidelines include:

* **Adults:**  The recommended daily allowance (RDA) is 75-90 mg for adults.  Higher doses are sometimes used for therapeutic purposes (e.g., treating scurvy or boosting immunity during illness), usually under medical supervision.  These higher doses are typically taken in divided amounts throughout the day.
* **Children:** RDA varies by age and can be found on recommended dietary guidelines from health organizations.
* **Oral:** Vitamin C is readily available in various oral forms like tablets, capsules, chewable tablets, and powders.  Follow the instructions on the specific product label.
* **IV:** Intravenous administration is primarily used in hospital settings to treat severe vitamin C deficiency or specific medical conditions, and it's administered under strict medical supervision.  The dosage is determined by the healthcare provider based on the patient's condition.


### Side Effects
Most people tolerate Vitamin C well, but high doses can cause side effects.  Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Stomach cramps
* Heartburn
* Headaches
* Insomnia

Less common but more serious side effects can include kidney stones (especially in individuals prone to them) and interference with certain medical tests.


### How it Works
Vitamin C acts as a powerful antioxidant, neutralizing harmful free radicals that can damage cells and contribute to various health problems.  It's also a co-factor in various enzymatic reactions, including those involved in collagen synthesis, iron absorption, and immune function.  In essence, it assists in crucial biochemical processes throughout the body.


### Precautions
* **Kidney stones:** Individuals with a history of kidney stones should use caution with high doses of Vitamin C.
* **Drug interactions:** Vitamin C can interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners and some chemotherapy drugs. Consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking Vitamin C if you are on other medications.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While generally safe, pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult a healthcare professional before significantly altering their Vitamin C intake.
* **G6PD deficiency:** Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should exercise caution as high doses of Vitamin C can potentially trigger hemolytic anemia.
