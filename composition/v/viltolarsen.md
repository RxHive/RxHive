# Viltolarsen
### Generic Name
Viltolarsen

### Usage
Viltolarsen is an antisense oligonucleotide medication approved for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  Specifically, it's indicated for patients with a confirmed mutation in the *DMD* gene that can be addressed through exon 53 skipping.  This means the medication works by modifying the genetic instructions within the body to produce a partially functional dystrophin protein.  Dystrophin is a protein crucial for muscle function, and its absence or dysfunction causes the debilitating effects of DMD.  Viltolarsen is not a cure for DMD but aims to improve muscle function and slow disease progression.  There are no other notable secondary uses currently approved.

### Dosage

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy:**

* **Adults and Children:** The recommended dose is 80 mg/kg administered once weekly via a 60-minute intravenous infusion.  The dose is the same for both adults and children.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Kidney Function:**  Before starting Viltolarsen, baseline assessments of serum cystatin C levels, urine dipstick analysis, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio are necessary.  Measuring the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is also recommended.  Close monitoring of kidney function during treatment is crucial.  No dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment; however, close monitoring is essential.

* **Administration:** Viltolarsen is administered intravenously (IV).  The infusion should be completed within 60 minutes.  The solution should be prepared and administered according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### Side Effects

The following is a list of common and less common side effects of Viltolarsen. Remember that not everyone experiences side effects, and the severity can vary.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Reduced ejection fraction (heart function)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Urticaria (hives)
* Bruising
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Cough
* Upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea)
* Injection site reactions (bruising, erythema, swelling)
* Fever


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Kidney toxicity is a potential serious side effect.  Close monitoring is essential.

**If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Viltolarsen is an antisense oligonucleotide.  It works by targeting a specific section of the genetic code (exon 53) within the dystrophin pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA).  By binding to this exon, Viltolarsen prevents it from being included in the final messenger RNA (mRNA) during a process called splicing. This "exon skipping" allows the body to produce a shortened, but partially functional, dystrophin protein.  Although shorter than the normal protein, this modified protein can partially restore some muscle function, thereby mitigating the severity of DMD symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Kidney Toxicity:** Viltolarsen can increase the risk of kidney problems. Regular monitoring of kidney function is crucial.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There is no data on the use of Viltolarsen during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed by the healthcare provider.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions with other drugs have been reported, but it's always important to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Like any medication, allergic reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Viltolarsen administered?**
   * A: It's given intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once a week.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**
   * A:  The timeframe for noticing improvements varies among individuals.  It's not a quick fix but aims to improve muscle function over time and slow disease progression.

* **Q:  Are there any specific dietary restrictions?**
   * A: There are no specific dietary restrictions associated with Viltolarsen.  Maintain a healthy, balanced diet.

* **Q: How should I store Viltolarsen?**
   * A: Follow the manufacturer's instructions precisely for storage.


* **Q: What if I miss a dose?**
   * A: Administer the missed dose as soon as possible, but don't double up on doses.  Consult your doctor if you have concerns about missed doses.
