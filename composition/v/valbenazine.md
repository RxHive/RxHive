# Valbenazine
### Generic Name
Valbenazine

### Usage
Valbenazine is primarily used to treat adults with tardive dyskinesia (TD). TD is a syndrome that causes repetitive, involuntary movements, typically in the face, mouth, and limbs. It often develops as a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications.  Currently, there are no approved uses for valbenazine in children or adolescents.

### Dosage
**Adults (Tardive Dyskinesia):** Valbenazine is administered orally. The typical starting dose is 40 mg once daily. After one week, the dose may be increased to 80 mg once daily.  In some cases, a dose of 40 mg or 60 mg once daily may be considered based on individual response and tolerability.  

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of valbenazine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no dose adjustment is usually needed.  However, for those with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C), the recommended dose is 40 mg once daily.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  However, valbenazine is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers:**  Individuals known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 (an enzyme involved in drug metabolism) may require a dose reduction, based on their tolerability.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Significant interactions can occur with other medications. Valbenazine's dose may need to be adjusted or its use avoided altogether when taken concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, or digoxin.  Consult with a healthcare professional for specific guidance on managing these interactions.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Sedation

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**
* Abnormal gait
* Dizziness
* Problems with balance/falls
* Akathisia (restlessness)
* Anxiety
* Drooling
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders)
* Insomnia
* Respiratory tract infection
* Vomiting
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Worsening of dyskinesia
* Increased blood sugar levels
* Weight gain

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  While rare, hypersensitivity reactions and skin rashes have been reported.  There is also a potential risk of QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm).

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Valbenazine's exact mechanism of action in treating tardive dyskinesia isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to work by reversibly inhibiting vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). VMAT2 is a protein that helps regulate the storage and release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, in the brain. By inhibiting VMAT2, valbenazine may help reduce the excessive movement characteristic of TD.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Valbenazine is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its ingredients.
* **Warnings:**  Valbenazine may increase the risk of QT prolongation, depression, suicidal thoughts, somnolence, and Parkinson-like symptoms.  It should be used with caution in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, those taking strong CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and those who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers.  Monitor patients closely for these risks.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Valbenazine may harm a developing fetus.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with valbenazine and for five days after the final dose.  Discuss risks and benefits with a healthcare provider before using valbenazine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** As previously mentioned, valbenazine can interact with several other medications. Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take valbenazine with food?** A: Yes, valbenazine can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store valbenazine?** A: Store valbenazine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I drive while taking valbenazine?** A:  Valbenazine can cause drowsiness and dizziness. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.
* **Q: How long does it take for valbenazine to work?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement in TD symptoms varies among individuals.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions and attend regular follow-up appointments.
