# Valproic Acid
### Generic Name
Valproic Acid

### Usage

Valproic acid, also known as valproate, is a versatile medication primarily used to treat seizures.  It's effective against both focal-onset (partial) seizures, which affect only part of the brain, and generalized-onset seizures, involving the whole brain.  Specific seizure types it addresses include complex partial seizures and absence seizures.  It can be used as monotherapy (the sole medication) or as adjunctive therapy (alongside other anti-seizure medications).

Beyond seizure control, valproic acid is also approved for treating acute manic or mixed episodes in bipolar disorder.  It can be used alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs.  Furthermore, it's used off-label for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and as a preventative measure (prophylaxis) for migraines.  It's important to note that off-label uses are prescribed at the discretion of a healthcare professional based on individual needs and responses.

### Dosage

Dosage of valproic acid varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation of the medication (tablets, syrup, injection).  Precise dosing should always be determined by a doctor.  The information below is for general understanding and should not be used to self-medicate.

**Adults:**

* **Bipolar Disorder (Acute Episodes):**  Initial doses range from 500-750 mg/day, often increased gradually until the desired effect is achieved.  A weight-based loading dose may be used for rapid symptom control. Maximum daily dose is typically 60 mg/kg/day.

* **Migraine Prophylaxis:**  Initial dose is often 500 mg daily (extended-release), adjusted upward as tolerated, up to a maximum of 1000 mg/day.

* **Seizures (Monotherapy or Adjunctive):**  Initial doses are typically 10-15 mg/kg/day for complex partial seizures, and 15 mg/kg/day for absence seizures, adjusted upwards as needed, with a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day.  IV administration is possible in certain circumstances, as directed by a physician.


**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight in mg/kg/day and are significantly lower than adult doses.  The exact regimen depends on the specific condition, age, and other factors and must be determined by a pediatrician or neurologist experienced in pediatric epilepsy or bipolar disorder management.  Valproic acid is generally avoided in children under 2 due to an increased risk of liver damage.


**Important Note:**  The method of administration (oral, intravenous, rectal) will also affect the dosing and timing. Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.

### Side Effects

Valproic acid can cause various side effects, ranging in severity.  Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Tremor


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Pancreatitis
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) â€“ potentially fatal, especially in young children
* Blood disorders (thrombocytopenia)
* Weight changes
* Mood changes (depression, anxiety)
* Cognitive impairment

If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as serious, immediate medical attention is necessary.

### How it Works

Valproic acid primarily works by increasing the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning it reduces nerve activity.  Increased GABA levels help to suppress excessive neuronal firing which is a characteristic of seizures.  Additionally, valproic acid may also block sodium channels in nerve cells, further reducing their excitability.  The precise mechanisms by which it affects bipolar disorder and migraine are still under investigation.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Valproic acid is a Category D drug in many countries during pregnancy and a Category X for migraine prophylaxis. It carries a significant risk of birth defects, including neural tube defects, and impaired cognitive development in the child.  Pregnant women and women of child-bearing age should discuss all risks and benefits with their physician.  Effective contraception is mandatory for women of childbearing potential taking this medication.

* **Liver Disease:** Valproic acid is contraindicated in individuals with significant liver impairment. Liver function tests are usually conducted before and during treatment to monitor for potential liver damage.

* **Urea Cycle Disorders:** Valproic acid is contraindicated in patients with urea cycle disorders.

* **Mitochondrial Disorders:** It's contraindicated in patients with known mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG gene mutations and in children under 2 suspected of having such disorders.

* **Drug Interactions:** Valproic acid can interact with numerous other drugs, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Careful monitoring is required in the elderly due to increased sensitivity to side effects and the possibility of decreased clearance.

* **Children under 2:**  Valproic acid is generally avoided in this age group due to the high risk of liver damage.

* **Suicidal Ideation:** Increased risk of suicidal ideation has been reported; patients should be monitored closely for changes in mood or behavior.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking valproic acid suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking valproic acid suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to a return of seizures or other withdrawal symptoms.  The medication should be tapered off gradually under medical supervision.

* **Q: How should I store valproic acid?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is valproic acid habit-forming?** A: Valproic acid is not considered habit-forming in the same way as opioids or other addictive substances. However, it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions and not stop taking it without consulting them.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking valproic acid?** A: Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of valproic acid and should be avoided or consumed only in moderation and with your doctor's guidance.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a side effect?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed as serious or potentially life-threatening.
