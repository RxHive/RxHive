# Valsartan + Hydrochlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

### Usage
Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by combining two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic.  By combining these two medications, a synergistic effect is achieved, often resulting in better blood pressure control than either drug alone.  This combination is particularly helpful for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with either valsartan or hydrochlorothiazide individually.  While primarily used for hypertension, it might be considered in managing some forms of heart failure, particularly when hypertension is a contributing factor.  It's crucial to remember that this medication should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors like the patient's age, overall health, and response to treatment. A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage.  Generally:

* **Oral:**  The usual starting dose is one tablet of a specific combination strength (e.g., 80mg/12.5mg valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide) once daily.  The dose may be adjusted based on blood pressure response.  Higher strengths of the combination are available.  Tablets should be swallowed whole with water, preferably at the same time each day.

* **IV (Intravenous):** Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide is *not* available in an intravenous formulation.  Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide are administered intravenously separately when needed.  The dosages for IV administration will be determined and administered by a healthcare professional in a clinical setting.

* **Children:** This combination medication is generally *not* recommended for children.  Pediatric hypertension requires separate dosing considerations and appropriate medications.

* **Elderly:**  Older adults may require lower starting doses due to potential age-related changes in kidney function.

**Important Note:**  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely regarding dosage and administration.  Never alter your dosage without consulting your physician.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Dry cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)
* Muscle cramps

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Kidney problems
* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Valsartan works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, valsartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure.  Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic; it increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. This reduces the volume of fluid in the bloodstream, which also contributes to lowering blood pressure.  Together, these two mechanisms provide a more comprehensive approach to blood pressure management.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with severe liver disease, anuria (absence of urine production), or hypersensitivity to valsartan or hydrochlorothiazide or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide may interact with several other medications, including potassium-sparing diuretics, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain diabetes medications.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters.  It is also not recommended for breastfeeding mothers.

* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Patients with impaired kidney or liver function require careful monitoring and may need dosage adjustments.

* **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Hydrochlorothiazide can cause electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, low sodium, etc.).  Regular monitoring of electrolytes is often necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure, potentially causing serious health problems.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for discontinuation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can lower blood pressure further and interact negatively with this medication.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q:  Is this medication right for me?** A: Only your doctor can determine if valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide is the appropriate medication for your specific condition and health status.  They will consider your medical history, other medications, and overall health before making a recommendation.
