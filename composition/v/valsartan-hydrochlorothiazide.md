# Valsartan + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels and increasing the amount of water and salt your body excretes, thus lowering blood pressure. It may be used alone or with other medications to control blood pressure.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is often a sign that your body is adjusting to the medication.  It usually subsides over time.
* **Headache:** Similar to dizziness, headaches can be a common initial side effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak is possible.
* **Nausea:** Some individuals may experience nausea or stomach upset.
* **Muscle cramps or pain:** Less common, but possible.
* **Changes in blood potassium levels:**  Low or high potassium can be a concern. Your doctor will likely monitor your potassium levels.
* **Changes in blood sugar levels:** This is more likely to occur in people with diabetes.
* **Dry cough:** This is more often associated with the Valsartan component.
* **Increased risk of infections:** This is linked to the diuretic effect of Hydrochlorothiazide.
* **Allergic reactions (rare):** Symptoms can include rash, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**Serious side effects, though rare, include:**

* **Signs of liver damage:** Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain.
* **Signs of angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.  This is a medical emergency.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):** This can be life-threatening.


**How it Works:**  This combination drug works in two ways:

* **Valsartan:** This is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow. Valsartan blocks the effects of angiotensin II, allowing blood vessels to relax and widen, thus lowering blood pressure.

* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** This is a thiazide diuretic.  It helps your body get rid of excess sodium and water through urine.  By reducing the amount of fluid in your bloodstream, it lowers blood pressure.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide?**  It's best to limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication, as alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor.

* **Can I take this medication if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?**  No.  This medication is generally contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor immediately about alternative options.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist to discuss your concerns.  Some side effects are manageable, while others may require a change in medication.

* **How often do I need to have my blood pressure checked?** Your doctor will advise on the frequency of blood pressure monitoring, which may vary based on your individual needs and health status.
