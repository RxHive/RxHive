# Vorozole
### Generic Name
Vorozole

### Usage
Vorozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor.  It was investigated for treating postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.  Its primary intended use was to reduce estrogen levels in the body, thereby slowing the growth of estrogen-receptor-positive breast tumors.  However, it's important to note that vorozole is no longer used clinically due to its lack of demonstrable advantage over other treatments in clinical trials.  Research focused on other third-generation aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, which showed more promising results.

### Dosage
Since vorozole is not currently used clinically, specific dosage recommendations are unavailable.  Past research involved various dosage regimens, but these are not relevant for current medical practice.

### Side Effects
Because vorozole was never approved for clinical use, a complete profile of side effects is not fully established. However, given its mechanism of action as an aromatase inhibitor, potential side effects could have included those commonly seen with other aromatase inhibitors, such as:

* **Common:**  Hot flashes, joint pain (arthralgia), bone thinning (osteoporosis â€“ increased risk of fractures), fatigue, nausea, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Elevated cholesterol levels, vaginal dryness, decreased libido.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If any adverse effects occur, immediate medical attention should be sought.

### How it Works
Vorozole works by inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.  Aromatase is responsible for converting androgens (male hormones) into estrogens (female hormones) in peripheral tissues, including breast tumor tissue. By blocking this conversion, vorozole lowers estrogen levels, which can slow or stop the growth of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers that rely on estrogen for growth.

### Precautions
As vorozole is not used clinically, detailed precautions are not readily available in standard medical resources.  However, given its mechanism and the precautions associated with other aromatase inhibitors, potential considerations would include:

* **Contraindications:**  The drug would likely be contraindicated in women who are not postmenopausal, those with severe liver or kidney disease, and individuals with known hypersensitivity to vorozole or similar compounds.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications could occur.  A healthcare provider should always be consulted about any other medications being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Vorozole would have been contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to its potential impact on hormonal balance and fetal development.
* **Older Adults and Children:**  The use in these populations would have required special consideration and careful monitoring, similar to other aromatase inhibitors.

### FAQs
Given that vorozole is no longer in clinical use, there are limited FAQs available. The information below reflects general considerations about past research and potential concerns, not current clinical practices.

* **Q: Is vorozole still available?** A: No, vorozole is not currently available for clinical use.
* **Q: Why was vorozole discontinued?** A: Clinical trials showed no significant survival benefit compared to existing treatments.
* **Q: What are the alternatives to vorozole?** A:  Other aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are now used in the treatment of breast cancer.
* **Q:  Where can I find more information about vorozole?** A:  Information from archived medical research publications might provide further insights, but this should be interpreted by a medical professional.  Current medical resources will not feature vorozole as a treatment option.
