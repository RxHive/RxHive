# Varenicline
### Generic Name
Varenicline

### Usage
Varenicline is primarily used as a medication to help people quit smoking. It's a prescription drug that works by reducing the cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine addiction, making the quitting process easier and more successful.  While its primary use focuses on smoking cessation, it doesn't directly treat any other specific medical condition.


### Dosage

**Smoking Cessation (Adults):**

Varenicline treatment begins one week before the planned quit date or can start concurrently, with the quit date falling between days 8 and 35 of treatment.

* **Initiation (Days 1-3):** 0.5 mg once daily (OD).
* **Initiation (Days 4-7):** 0.5 mg twice daily (BID).
* **Maintenance (Day 8 onwards):** 1 mg BID for 11 weeks (minimum 12 weeks total treatment).  Treatment may continue for an additional 12 weeks if smoking cessation is successful at 12 weeks. If unsuccessful, the medication should be stopped and the reasons for failure reassessed.

**Gradual Quitting Approach:** For individuals who prefer a gradual approach, Varenicline dosing begins while reducing smoking by 50% of baseline in the first 4 weeks and a further 50% over the next 4 weeks.  Complete abstinence is the goal by 12 weeks, with treatment continuing for an additional 12 weeks (24 weeks total).

* **Renal Impairment:**
    * Creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¥ 30 mL/min: Use with caution; no dosage adjustment is usually needed.

### How it Works

Varenicline is a partial agonist of alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain.  These receptors are involved in nicotine's rewarding effects.  Varenicline partially activates these receptors, reducing the pleasurable effects of nicotine and lessening cravings. It also blocks the effects of nicotine if a person were to relapse by smoking, further mitigating the rewarding feeling.  This dual action helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and makes it easier to quit smoking.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Varenicline is contraindicated in individuals with severe hypersensitivity to it, and in non-smokers.
* **Interactions:** Varenicline can interact with several medications, including certain antibiotics (quinolones), HIV medications (dolutegravir), and others. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Varenicline may increase the risk of neuropsychiatric events (depression, suicidal thoughts), cardiovascular events, and allergic reactions. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, cardiovascular disease, or renal impairment should use it with caution and under close medical supervision.  Alcohol should be avoided during treatment.  Patients should be monitored for behavioral changes.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Varenicline is a Category C drug during pregnancy. The decision to use it during pregnancy should be made carefully, weighing the benefits against potential risks to the fetus. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration if breastfeeding. Infants should be monitored if exposed through breast milk.
