# Varenicline

**Generic Name:** Varenicline

**Usage:** Varenicline is used to help people quit smoking. It reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with nicotine cessation.  It's typically used as part of a comprehensive smoking cessation program that includes counseling and behavioral therapy.

**Side Effects:**  Varenicline can cause a range of side effects, some mild and some more serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:** This is a frequently reported side effect, often resolving with continued use.
* **Vomiting:** Less common than nausea, but can still occur.
* **Constipation or diarrhea:** Changes in bowel habits are possible.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping can occur.
* **Abnormal dreams:** Vivid, strange, or unusual dreams are reported.
* **Changes in mood:** Irritability, depression, anxiety, or agitation are possible.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention. These include:**

* **Changes in behavior or thinking:**  Suicidal thoughts or actions, new or worsening depression or anxiety, hostility, aggression, agitation, or other unusual changes in behavior.
* **Cardiovascular events:**  Although rare, reports of heart problems exist.  Consult your doctor if you have any concerns.
* **Neurological effects:** Seizures (rare but serious).
* **Allergic reactions:**  Skin rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.


**How it Works:** Varenicline is a partial nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. This means it binds to the same receptors in the brain that nicotine does, but it doesn't activate them as strongly.  This reduces the rewarding effects of nicotine, lessening cravings and withdrawal symptoms.  It also helps to block the effects of nicotine if a person does relapse and smoke.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  The full effects of varenicline may not be felt for several weeks.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and treatment plan.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking varenicline?**  While not explicitly contraindicated, excessive alcohol consumption might worsen some side effects, especially mood changes.  Moderation is advised.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I stop taking varenicline suddenly?**  It's generally recommended to follow your doctor's instructions regarding tapering off the medication to minimize potential withdrawal effects.  Sudden cessation might lead to increased cravings.
* **Is varenicline addictive?**  While varenicline itself is not considered physically addictive in the same way as nicotine, it's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment.
* **Who should not take varenicline?**  People with a history of serious mental illness, uncontrolled seizures, or severe cardiovascular disease should generally avoid varenicline or use it under very close medical supervision.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before using this medication.
* **What should I do if I experience serious side effects?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects, such as suicidal thoughts, seizures, or severe allergic reactions.
