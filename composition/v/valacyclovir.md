# Valacyclovir
### Generic Name
Valacyclovir

### Usage

Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat infections caused by the herpes viruses.  Its main applications include:

* **Genital Herpes:**  Valacyclovir treats both the initial outbreak and recurrent episodes of genital herpes. It's also used to suppress recurrent outbreaks and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to partners.  In patients with HIV, valacyclovir can suppress genital herpes.

* **Shingles (Herpes Zoster):** Valacyclovir effectively treats shingles in individuals with healthy immune systems.

* **Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis):** This medication shortens the duration and severity of cold sores.

* **Chickenpox (Varicella):** Valacyclovir can treat chickenpox in children with healthy immune systems (though its use is not approved for children under 2 years old).

While not its primary use, valacyclovir may be considered in some situations for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients.  This is considered an off-label use, meaning it's not officially approved for this purpose by regulatory bodies, and should only be used under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  The following are general guidelines, not a substitute for professional medical advice:


**Adults:**

* **Genital Herpes (Initial Episode):** 1 gram twice daily for 10 days.
* **Genital Herpes (Recurrent Episode):** 500 mg twice daily for 3 days.
* **Genital Herpes (Suppression, Immunocompetent):** 1 gram daily (or 500 mg daily for patients with fewer than 9 recurrences per year).
* **Genital Herpes (Suppression, HIV-infected, CD4 ≥ 100 cells/mm³):** 500 mg twice daily.
* **Shingles:** 1 gram three times daily for 7 days.
* **Cold Sores:** 2 grams twice daily for 1 day.
* **CMV Prevention (Off-label):**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the protocol and may involve 2 grams three or four times daily for extended periods.


**Children:**

* **Chickenpox (Ages >2 years):**  20 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days (not to exceed 1 gram per dose).  Use in children under 2 is not recommended.
* **Cold Sores (Ages >12 years):** 2 grams every 12 hours for 1 day.  Use in children under 12 is not recommended.


**Dosage Adjustments for Renal Impairment:**  Dosage must be reduced in patients with kidney problems.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your creatinine clearance (CrCl).


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and nasopharyngitis.

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Nervous system problems: dizziness, fatigue, depression, encephalopathy (rare but serious brain disorder)
* Skin reactions: rash, erythema multiforme
* Gastrointestinal issues: vomiting, diarrhea
* Blood problems: neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia
* Liver enzyme elevation
* Kidney problems: acute kidney injury


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Valacyclovir is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, acyclovir, in the body. Acyclovir works by interfering with the herpes virus's ability to replicate its DNA.  It does this by competing with a building block of viral DNA (deoxyguanosine triphosphate) for the viral enzyme that builds new DNA. By blocking this process, acyclovir inhibits the virus's reproduction and reduces the severity of the infection.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not use valacyclovir if you're allergic to valacyclovir or acyclovir.
* **Kidney Disease:** Use caution and adjust dosage if you have kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Valacyclovir is a Category B pregnancy drug (meaning animal studies show no risk, but human studies are lacking). While acyclovir is generally preferred in pregnancy, valacyclovir can be considered for its simpler dosing schedule.  It's excreted in breast milk, so discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Valacyclovir may interact with other medications, especially those that affect the kidneys.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Dehydration:** Adequate hydration is crucial while taking valacyclovir to minimize the risk of kidney problems.
* **HIV:** In patients with advanced HIV, use caution and monitor closely.


### FAQs

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking valacyclovir?**  It's generally advisable to avoid alcohol while on valacyclovir, especially high doses, to minimize the risk of side effects. Discuss this with your physician.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **How should I store valacyclovir?** Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Will valacyclovir cure my herpes infection?** No, valacyclovir does not cure herpes. It manages symptoms and reduces viral replication, but the virus remains dormant in the body.

* **Does valacyclovir prevent transmission of herpes?** Suppressive therapy can reduce the risk of transmission, but it's not a guarantee.  Safe sex practices remain essential to prevent spreading the infection.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of valacyclovir vary depending on the condition being treated.  You should generally see improvements within a few days.
