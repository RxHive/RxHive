# Vitamin A + Vitamin D + ThiamineVitamin B + Vitamin C + D-Panthenol
### Generic Name

Multivitamin with Vitamin A, D, B1, C, and Panthenol


### Usage

This multivitamin supplement provides a combination of essential vitamins crucial for various bodily functions.  Its primary use is to address or prevent deficiencies in Vitamins A, D, B1 (Thiamine), C, and Panthenol (Vitamin B5).  Deficiencies in these vitamins can lead to a range of health problems.  For instance, Vitamin A deficiency can impair vision and immune function; Vitamin D deficiency can weaken bones and increase the risk of infections; Thiamine deficiency (beriberi) affects the nervous system; Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) weakens connective tissues; and Panthenol deficiency can impact skin and hair health and energy production.  While this combination isn't typically prescribed to treat specific diseases, it's often recommended to support overall health, particularly in individuals with inadequate dietary intake or increased nutritional demands (e.g., pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, older adults, individuals with specific dietary restrictions or malabsorption issues). Note that this multivitamin is a *supplement* and should not replace a balanced diet.


### Dosage

Dosage will vary depending on the specific formulation (tablet, capsule, liquid) and the manufacturer.  Always follow the instructions printed on the product label.  Generally, the dosage is designed to provide a daily recommended intake or a portion thereof.  

* **Adults:**  A typical adult dose may range from one to two tablets or capsules daily, or as directed by a healthcare professional. The precise amount will be stated on the product packaging. 

* **Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower and should always be determined by a doctor or pharmacist based on the child's age and weight.  Liquid formulations are often preferred for children. Never give a child an adult dosage. 

* **Oral Administration:** Most formulations are for oral consumption. Swallow tablets or capsules with water.  Follow any specific instructions regarding timing (e.g., with food or on an empty stomach). 

* **IV Administration:** This multivitamin formulation is *not* typically administered intravenously.  Intravenous administration requires a specific medical prescription and should only be given by trained medical professionals.
