# Vitamin C + Cyanocobalamin + Folic Acid + Nicotinamide
### Generic Name
Vitamin C + Cyanocobalamin + Folic Acid + Nicotinamide


### Usage

This combination of vitamins is primarily used to treat or prevent deficiencies in vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), folate (folic acid), and vitamin B3 (nicotinamide).  These deficiencies can lead to a range of health problems.

* **Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy):**  Characterized by fatigue, weakness, and bleeding gums.  Severe deficiency can lead to more serious complications.

* **Vitamin B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia):**  Causes fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and neurological problems such as numbness and tingling.  Untreated, it can lead to irreversible nerve damage.

* **Folate deficiency (megaloblastic anemia):**  Results in fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and a higher risk of neural tube defects in developing fetuses.

* **Vitamin B3 (Niacin) deficiency (pellagra):** This is less common in developed countries but can manifest as dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia (the "3 D's").


This combination may also be used as a supportive therapy in certain conditions where these vitamins are needed in higher amounts, such as during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or periods of increased stress or illness.  However, it's crucial to remember this is not a substitute for a balanced diet and a healthcare professional should always be consulted before using this supplement.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation, the individual's needs (determined by a healthcare professional), and the severity of any deficiency.  There's no single universal dosage recommendation.  Dosage information should be found on the product label.  It is crucial to follow the instructions exactly as prescribed.  It's impossible to give precise dosage guidelines here without knowing the exact formulation of the product in question.

**General Considerations:**  For oral administration, the product is usually taken as directed with food or water.  Injectable forms require administration by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

While generally well-tolerated, some potential side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, diarrhea, stomach upset.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling. (Though rare)

* **High doses of Nicotinamide:** Flushing, itching, and liver damage (very high doses only).
* **High doses of Vitamin C:** Diarrhea, nausea, kidney stones (particularly in people with a history of kidney stones).


**Serious but less common side effects:**  These are rare but require immediate medical attention:  severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), difficulty breathing.


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.



### How it Works

This combination functions by supplementing the body with essential vitamins necessary for various metabolic processes.

* **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** Acts as an antioxidant, supporting the immune system, and aiding in collagen production.

* **Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin):** Essential for red blood cell formation, nerve function, and DNA synthesis.

* **Folate (Folic Acid):** Crucial for cell growth and division, particularly vital during pregnancy for preventing neural tube defects.

* **Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3):** Plays a role in energy production, DNA repair, and cell signaling.


By providing these essential vitamins, this combination helps correct deficiencies and supports overall health.
