# Vitamin B

It's impossible to provide details about a "generic Vitamin B" because Vitamin B is not a single vitamin but a complex of eight distinct water-soluble vitamins, each with its own specific functions, benefits, side effects, and mechanisms of action.  These include: Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Pyridoxine (B6), Biotin (B7), Folate (B9), and Cobalamin (B12).

To give you useful information, I need to specify which B vitamin you're interested in.  Please specify the vitamin (e.g., Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, etc.).  Then I can provide the details in the requested format.
