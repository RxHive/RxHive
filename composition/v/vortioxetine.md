# Vortioxetine
### Generic Name
Vortioxetine

### Usage
Vortioxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's a type of antidepressant that works differently than many others, impacting multiple serotonin receptors in the brain.  While its main indication is MDD, research is ongoing to explore its potential use in other conditions.

### Dosage
**Adults (Major Depressive Disorder):**

* **Initial Dose:**  The starting dose is usually 10 mg once daily (OD).  This may be increased to 20 mg OD if tolerated. If 10mg is not tolerated, a dose of 5mg OD may be used.
* **Maintenance Dose:** The daily dose can range from 5 to 20 mg, depending on individual response and tolerance.
* **Maximum Dose:**  The highest recommended daily dose is 20 mg.
* **Discontinuation:** While vortioxetine can be stopped abruptly, gradually reducing the dose (especially from 15mg or 20mg daily to 10mg for a week before stopping completely) is recommended whenever possible to minimize potential withdrawal symptoms.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of vortioxetine in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is usually needed for patients with liver problems.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically required for patients with kidney problems.
* **CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers:** For individuals who metabolize medications slowly (poor CYP2D6 metabolizers), the maximum dose should be 10 mg daily.  The dose should be halved if a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is also being taken, and returned to the original dosage after the inhibitor is discontinued.
* **Strong CYP Inducers:** If a strong CYP inducer is used concurrently, the vortioxetine dose may need to be increased, but not more than threefold.  Reduce the dose after stopping the inducer after 14 days.
* **MAO Inhibitors:** A significant time gap is required between stopping or starting MAO inhibitors (used for psychiatric disorders) and vortioxetine to prevent serious interactions like serotonin syndrome (at least 14 days after stopping an MAOI before starting vortioxetine, and at least 21 days after stopping vortioxetine before starting an MAOI).
* **Geriatric Patients:** Dosage adjustments aren't typically necessary for older adults, but  it's crucial to monitor for hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood), a risk associated with serotonergic antidepressants in this population.


**Administration:** Vortioxetine tablets can be taken with or without food.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (affecting >10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Sexual dysfunction (both in men and women)
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea

**Less Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Dizziness, abnormal dreams
* Dermatological: Itching (pruritus)
* Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, dry mouth (xerostomia), constipation, vomiting, flatulence

**Rare or Less Frequent Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Acute pancreatitis
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, skin rash, urticaria)
* Angle-closure glaucoma
* Hypomania or mania
* Seizures
* Serotonin syndrome
* Weight gain
* Withdrawal syndrome
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood)


**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Vortioxetine's exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by modulating the activity of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain that plays a crucial role in mood regulation.  It does this in multiple ways:

* **Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor:** It blocks the reabsorption of serotonin, increasing the amount available in the brain's synapses.
* **5-HT1A Receptor Agonist:** It also activates 5-HT1A receptors, which are involved in mood and anxiety.
* **5-HT3 Receptor Antagonist:** It blocks 5-HT3 receptors, potentially reducing nausea and other gastrointestinal side effects.

The combination of these actions is thought to contribute to its antidepressant effects.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Vortioxetine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to the drug or its components, including those with a history of angioedema, and for use with MAO inhibitors (within 14 days of starting vortioxetine, or within 21 days of stopping vortioxetine). It should not be started in patients already receiving linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.
* **Increased Risk:**  Increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly in young adults, abnormal bleeding, serotonin syndrome, mania/hypomania, hyponatremia (low sodium), angle-closure glaucoma, CNS depression, and fractures.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders, a history of seizures, or conditions that increase seizure risk.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Vortioxetine is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug (potential risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out).  Use during pregnancy, especially the third trimester, should be carefully weighed against the potential benefits.  It's unknown whether vortioxetine is excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding should be considered carefully.
* **Drug Interactions:** Vortioxetine can interact with other drugs, particularly other serotonergic medications (those affecting serotonin levels), MAO inhibitors, NSAIDs, aspirin, and warfarin. Consult your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Because of potential side effects like dizziness, patients should avoid activities that require alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I stop taking vortioxetine suddenly?** A: While it is possible, it's generally recommended to gradually reduce the dose under your doctor's supervision to minimize potential withdrawal effects.
* **Q: How should I store vortioxetine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking vortioxetine?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol or limit its consumption while taking vortioxetine as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly those related to CNS depression.
* **Q: Can I take vortioxetine with other medications?** A: It's crucial to discuss all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies with your doctor before taking vortioxetine to prevent potential drug interactions.  This is especially important with other serotonergic drugs and MAO inhibitors.
