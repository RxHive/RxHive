# Valrubicin
### Generic Name
Valrubicin

### Usage
Valrubicin is an antineoplastic agent (cancer medication) used specifically for treating Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG)-refractory carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the urinary bladder.  This means it's used in patients with a type of bladder cancer that hasn't responded to treatment with BCG, a common immunotherapy.  It's primarily indicated for those patients where surgery (cystectomy) carries significant risks.  Valrubicin is administered directly into the bladder (intravesical administration), not intravenously or intramuscularly.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The typical dosage for adults with BCG-refractory bladder cancer CIS is 800 mg administered intravesically once a week for six weeks. The medication is dissolved in a suitable volume (typically 75 mL of normal saline) and instilled into the bladder via a catheter. The solution should be retained in the bladder for at least two hours before voiding. It's crucial to delay treatment for at least two weeks following any transurethral resection or fulguration procedures (surgical removal of bladder tissue).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of valrubicin have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  This highlights the importance of close monitoring by a healthcare professional in such cases.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Urinary frequency
*   Urinary urgency
*   Dysuria (painful urination)
*   Bladder spasm
*   Hematuria (blood in the urine)
*   Bladder pain


Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

*   Abdominal pain
*   Nausea
*   Headache
*   Malaise (general discomfort)
*   Urinary retention
*   Back pain
*   Dizziness
*   Rash
*   Diarrhea
*   Anemia

While less common, serious side effects are possible.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.

### How it Works
Valrubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that works by interfering with the function of topoisomerase II, an enzyme crucial for DNA replication and repair in cells.  By inhibiting this enzyme, valrubicin prevents cancer cells from properly replicating their DNA, leading to cell death. Unlike some other anthracyclines, valrubicin doesn't appear to work by intercalating (inserting itself between) DNA strands.  Instead, its primary mechanism involves inhibiting DNA synthesis and causing extensive chromosomal damage, ultimately halting cell growth in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Valrubicin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

*   Known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to anthracyclines, polyoxyl castor oil, or any component of the formulation.
*   A perforated bladder (hole in the bladder).
*   Active urinary tract infection.
*   Small bladder capacity (inability to retain 75 mL of solution).


**Warnings/Precautions:**

*   Valrubicin can cause bladder irritation, and this risk is increased in patients with pre-existing irritable bladder symptoms.
*   The urine may become red-tinged during treatment.
*   Use with caution in patients with significant bladder problems.
*   The medication is for intravesical use only and should not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly.  Use non-PVC tubing during administration due to the polyoxyl castor oil component.
*   Pregnancy Category C:  Valrubicin may harm a developing fetus.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued before starting this treatment.
