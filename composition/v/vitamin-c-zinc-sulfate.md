# Vitamin C + Zinc Sulfate

**Generic Name:**  Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) + Zinc Sulfate

**Usage:**

This combination is commonly used to support the immune system.  Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Zinc is a mineral that plays a role in immune cell function.  This combination is often taken to reduce the duration and severity of colds and other respiratory infections, although definitive scientific evidence supporting this claim is mixed and further research is needed.  It's also sometimes used to support wound healing.  The specific usage should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**

* **Vitamin C:** At high doses, Vitamin C can cause diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, and heartburn.  Kidney stones are a rare but possible side effect in predisposed individuals.
* **Zinc:**  High doses of zinc can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and loss of appetite.  Long-term high-dose supplementation can lead to copper deficiency and affect immune function negatively.  Zinc can interfere with the absorption of some medications.


**How it Works:**

* **Vitamin C:** Acts as an antioxidant, neutralizing harmful free radicals and boosting the immune system by supporting the production and function of white blood cells.
* **Zinc:**  Plays a critical role in immune cell development and function. It's involved in numerous immune processes, including cell-mediated immunity and the production of antibodies. It also helps in wound healing.
