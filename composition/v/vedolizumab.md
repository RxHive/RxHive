# Vedolizumab
### Generic Name
Vedolizumab

### Usage
Vedolizumab is a medication primarily used to treat moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in adults.  These are both inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) causing chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Vedolizumab works by targeting a specific part of the immune system that contributes to this inflammation, helping to reduce symptoms and improve the condition.  It's not a cure for IBD, but it can significantly improve symptoms and allow for better management of the disease.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is an intravenous (IV) infusion of 300 mg administered over 30 minutes.  The infusion schedule involves doses at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by infusions every 8 weeks thereafter.  Treatment should be discontinued if there's no improvement by week 14.  There is currently no established dosage for children.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment haven't been established.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include headache, the development of antibodies, arthralgia (joint pain), and nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include fatigue, pruritus (itching), skin rash, nausea, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), influenza, back pain, limb pain, bronchitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, and infusion-related reactions.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Malignant neoplasms (cancers)
*   Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and serious brain infection
*   Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Bronchospasm

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by targeting and blocking α4β7 integrin. This integrin is a protein on the surface of certain immune cells, and it plays a role in the inflammation seen in IBD. By binding to α4β7 integrin, vedolizumab prevents these immune cells from entering the inflamed tissue in the gut, thus reducing the inflammation and improving symptoms.

### Precautions
Vedolizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components and those with severe infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal).  There's an increased risk of infections, hypersensitivity reactions, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), liver injury, and PML when using vedolizumab.  Use caution in patients with tuberculosis, skin infections, open wounds, or allergies.  The risk of infections is increased with concomitant use of TNF-blocking agents and natalizumab; concomitant use should be avoided.  Vedolizumab is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects during pregnancy haven't been fully established.  It's excreted in breast milk, so its use during breastfeeding requires careful consideration of the potential benefits versus risks.  Immunizations should be up-to-date before starting treatment, and live vaccines should be avoided concurrently unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How is vedolizumab administered?** A: It's given intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes.

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Improvement may not be seen until several weeks into treatment.  Your doctor will monitor your progress.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to reschedule your infusion.

*   **Q: How should I store vedolizumab?** A: Follow your pharmacist's instructions for storage, which typically involve refrigeration.
