# Vedolizumab

**Generic Name:** Vedolizumab

**Usage:** Vedolizumab is used to treat moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in adults.  It's specifically indicated for patients who haven't responded to or can't tolerate other treatments like corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or TNF blockers.  It is *not* a first-line treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, vedolizumab can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Infections:** Increased risk of infections (respiratory, urinary tract, etc.) due to its immunosuppressive effects.  This is a significant concern.
* **Infusion Reactions:**  Reactions at the infusion site (redness, swelling, pain) and more serious systemic reactions (fever, chills, hypotension) can occur during or shortly after infusion.
* **Nausea, vomiting, headache:** Relatively common gastrointestinal and neurological side effects.
* **Headache:** A frequently reported side effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Pain:** Various types of pain including abdominal pain and musculoskeletal pain.


**Serious side effects**, though less common, can include:

* **Serious infections:** Including opportunistic infections (infections caused by organisms that usually don't cause disease in healthy individuals).
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Severe allergic reactions.
* **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):** A rare but potentially fatal brain infection.
* **Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL):** A rare type of cancer.
* **Certain cancers:**  An increased risk of certain types of cancer has been associated with immunomodulatory drugs.


**How it Works:** Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody. It works by selectively targeting α4β7 integrin, a protein found on the surface of certain white blood cells (lymphocytes). These lymphocytes play a key role in the inflammation associated with UC and CD. By blocking α4β7 integrin, vedolizumab prevents these cells from migrating to the gut, reducing inflammation and improving symptoms.  Importantly, it doesn't broadly suppress the immune system like some other biologics, leading to a potentially lower risk of certain side effects, but infections remain a significant concern.
