# Vonoprazan + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin
### Generic Name
Vonoprazan + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin


### Usage

This combination medication is specifically designed to treat *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*) infection in adults.  *H. pylori* is a bacterium that infects the stomach and can cause ulcers, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), and even increase the risk of stomach cancer. This triple therapy approach combines the action of a proton pump inhibitor (Vonoprazan), a penicillin-class antibiotic (Amoxicillin), and a macrolide antibiotic (Clarithromycin) to effectively eradicate the bacteria.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical dosage is Vonoprazan 20 mg + Amoxicillin 1000 mg + Clarithromycin 500 mg, each administered twice daily (BID), meaning twice a day, 12 hours apart (typically morning and evening). This regimen should be followed for 14 days.  

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of this combination in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  No dosage adjustment is needed for mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A).  However, this combination should be avoided in patients with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-89 mL/min).  Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min).

**Administration:** This medication is taken orally (by mouth).  It can be taken with or without food.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<10%):**  Many other side effects are possible; the list below is not exhaustive.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any of the following:

* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (severe diarrhea)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
*  Any other unusual or concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

This combination therapy works synergistically to eliminate *H. pylori* infection.  Vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB), reduces stomach acid production. This creates a more favorable environment for the antibiotics to work effectively. Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin are antibiotics that target and kill the *H. pylori* bacteria. By reducing stomach acid and using two different classes of antibiotics, this approach increases the chance of successful eradication of the infection.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vonoprazan, Amoxicillin (or other beta-lactam antibiotics), or Clarithromycin (or other macrolide antibiotics).
* **Drug Interactions:** Several drug interactions are possible, including those with strong CYP3A inducers and inhibitors, probenecid, allopurinol, omeprazole, itraconazole, and certain antivirals.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before starting this therapy.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use is not recommended during pregnancy unless there are no alternative treatments.  If used during lactation (breastfeeding), the mother should pump and discard breast milk during treatment and for 2 days afterward.
* **Other Precautions:** This combination should be avoided in patients with severe liver or kidney disease, and caution is advised in patients with myasthenia gravis.
