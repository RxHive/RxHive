# Vardenafil

**Generic Name:** Vardenafil

**Usage:** Vardenafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men.  It's also sometimes used off-label to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), though this is less common and requires a doctor's prescription and monitoring.  The primary use remains treating ED by increasing blood flow to the penis, facilitating an erection.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, vardenafil can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Facial flushing:**  Redness in the face and neck.
* **Nasal congestion:** Stuffy or runny nose.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Dyspepsia (indigestion):** Upset stomach.
* **Muscle aches:** Pain or soreness in the muscles.
* **Back pain:**  Pain in the back.
* **Vision changes:** Blurred vision, changes in color perception (seeing a blue tinge), or increased light sensitivity.  This is particularly important to report to a doctor immediately.

**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Priapism:** A prolonged and painful erection lasting more than 4 hours. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Sudden decrease or loss of vision:** This can be a sign of a serious condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).
* **Sudden decrease or loss of hearing:** This can be a sign of a serious condition.
* **Heart attack or stroke:** While rare, vardenafil can increase the risk in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms may include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.

**How it Works:** Vardenafil belongs to a class of medications called phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors.  It works by increasing blood flow to the penis.  When a man is sexually stimulated, the body releases nitric oxide, which relaxes the blood vessels in the penis. This allows more blood to flow into the penis, causing an erection.  Vardenafil inhibits PDE5, an enzyme that breaks down nitric oxide, allowing the effect of nitric oxide to last longer and resulting in an improved ability to achieve and maintain an erection.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking vardenafil?**  While moderate alcohol consumption is usually acceptable, excessive alcohol can reduce the effectiveness of vardenafil and increase the risk of side effects.  It's best to avoid excessive alcohol use while taking this medication.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Vardenafil is typically taken as needed, not on a regular schedule.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Can I take vardenafil with other medications?**  Vardenafil can interact with other medications, particularly nitrates (used to treat angina) and some heart medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting vardenafil.  Some interactions can be dangerous.

* **How long does it take to work?**  The onset of action can vary, but it generally takes 25-60 minutes for vardenafil to start working.

* **How long does the effect last?** The effects typically last for 4-5 hours, but this can vary depending on individual factors.

* **Who shouldn't take vardenafil?**  Individuals with certain heart conditions, those taking nitrates, those with severe liver or kidney problems, and those with a history of priapism should not take vardenafil.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not take vardenafil.
