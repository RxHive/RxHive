# Vismodegib
### Generic Name
Vismodegib

### Usage
Vismodegib is primarily used to treat adults with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC).  This includes metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC that has spread to other parts of the body) and locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC that is large, growing rapidly, or hasn't responded well to other treatments). It's prescribed for patients whose disease has recurred after surgery or for those who are not suitable candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage is 150 mg orally once daily, continuing until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  There is no specific dosage adjustment needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However,  dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of side effects experienced by the patient.  If intolerable side effects arise, the medication should be withheld for up to eight weeks, pending improvement or resolution.  In cases of severe cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Vismodegib should be permanently discontinued.

Vismodegib is **not** approved for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to safety concerns and the potential for premature fusion of the epiphyses (growth plates in bones).

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Changes in taste (ageusia, dysgeusia)
*   Constipation
*   Decreased appetite
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Hair loss (alopecia)
*   Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation in premenopausal women)
*   Weight loss
*   Joint pain (arthralgia)
*   Muscle spasms

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or reported post-marketing) include:

*   Low potassium (hypokalemia)
*   Low sodium (hyponatremia)
*   Increased creatine phosphokinase levels in the blood
*   Azotemia (build-up of nitrogenous waste products in the blood)
*   Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS)
*   Liver injury

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Vismodegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor. The hedgehog signaling pathway is a group of proteins involved in cell growth and development.  In some cancers, like BCC, this pathway is overactive, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Vismodegib works by binding to and blocking a protein called smoothened (SMO), a key component of the hedgehog pathway. By inhibiting SMO, Vismodegib slows or stops the growth of cancer cells.

### Precautions
Vismodegib is contraindicated in:

*   Patients with hypersensitivity to Vismodegib or its components
*   Pregnant women or women who may become pregnant.  Vismodegib is known to cause severe birth defects.
*   Breastfeeding women.
*   Children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

**Important warnings:** Vismodegib carries a significant risk of embryo-fetal toxicity.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of starting treatment and use highly effective contraception during and for 24 months after treatment. Males should also use condoms if their partner is of childbearing age during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose.
