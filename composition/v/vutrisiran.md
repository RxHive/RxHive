# Vutrisiran
### Generic Name
Vutrisiran

### Usage
Vutrisiran is a medication used to treat the polyneuropathy (nerve damage) associated with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adults.  hATTR amyloidosis is a rare, inherited disorder where an abnormal protein, transthyretin (TTR), builds up in various organs, including nerves, causing damage.  Vutrisiran's primary role is to manage the painful symptoms and progression of nerve damage caused by this protein buildup.  Currently, it is not approved for other uses.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage for adults with hATTR amyloidosis polyneuropathy is 25 mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once every three months.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Vutrisiran in children have not been established.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** For adults with mild hepatic (liver) impairment (total bilirubin ≤1 x ULN and AST >1 x ULN, or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST), no dose adjustment is needed.  However,  dosing adjustments for moderate or severe hepatic impairment have not been studied.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is necessary for adults with mild or moderate renal (kidney) impairment (eGFR ≥30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m²).  Information on dosing in severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease is unavailable.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include arthralgia (joint pain).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

* Atrioventricular heart block (a heart rhythm problem)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Decreased vitamin A levels
* Injection site reactions (such as redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site)


Less common but potentially serious side effects can also occur.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


### How it Works
Vutrisiran is a type of medication called a siRNA (small interfering RNA). It works by targeting and silencing the messenger RNA (mRNA) that instructs the body to produce the abnormal transthyretin (TTR) protein. By reducing the production of this abnormal protein, Vutrisiran helps to decrease the accumulation of TTR protein deposits in tissues and thus reduces nerve damage.

### Precautions

* **Vitamin A Deficiency:** Vutrisiran treatment reduces serum vitamin A levels.  Supplementation with the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised.  Higher doses of vitamin A should not be used to try and achieve normal serum levels, as serum levels do not reflect total body vitamin A.  Patients should be monitored for symptoms of vitamin A deficiency, such as night blindness and referred to an ophthalmologist if such symptoms appear.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** There's limited data on Vutrisiran's use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The potential risks and benefits should be carefully evaluated with a healthcare professional.
* **Missed Dose:** If a dose is missed, administer Vutrisiran as soon as possible and resume the regular 3-month dosing schedule from the last administered dose.
