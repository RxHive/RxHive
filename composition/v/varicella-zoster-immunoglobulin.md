# Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin
### Generic Name
Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG)

### Usage
Varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) is primarily used for postexposure prophylaxis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection in high-risk individuals.  This means it helps prevent the development of chickenpox (varicella) or shingles (zoster) after exposure to the virus.  High-risk individuals include those with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised), pregnant women, and newborns.  It can also be used as an adjuvant therapy (additional treatment) in some cases of varicella infection, especially for immunocompromised individuals.  The specific use and dosage will be determined by a healthcare provider based on individual risk factors.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (intravenous [IV] or intramuscular [IM]), patient weight, age, and the specific clinical situation (prophylaxis vs. treatment).  Always follow the prescribing healthcare professional's instructions precisely.


**Adult Dosage (Post-exposure prophylaxis):**

* **IV:** 1 mL/kg (25 units/kg). Higher doses might be considered with repeated exposure.
* **IM:**  Dosage depends on weight:
    * <30 kg: 375 units
    * 30.1-40 kg: 500 units
    * â‰¥40.1 kg: 625 units
A repeat dose may be needed for high-risk patients with additional exposure more than 3 weeks after the initial dose.

**Pediatric Dosage (Post-exposure prophylaxis):**

* **IV:** Same as adult dose.
* **IM:** Dosage depends on weight:
    * <2 kg: 62.5 units
    * 2.1-10 kg: 125 units
    * 10.1-20 kg: 250 units
    * 20.1-30 kg: 375 units
    * 30.1-40 kg: 500 units
    * >40.1 kg: 625 units
A repeat dose may be needed for high-risk patients with additional exposure more than 3 weeks after the initial dose.

**Adult and Pediatric Dosage (Adjuvant Therapy):**

* **IV:** 1-2 mL/kg (25-50 units/kg).  The dose may be repeated as clinically indicated.

**Important Note:**  For both prophylaxis and treatment, administration should ideally start within 96 hours, and within 10 days of exposure. In hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients or varicella-zoster vaccine recipients developing a varicella-like rash, administration should be within 96 hours, ideally within 48 hours.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Chills
* Fatigue
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Pain at the injection site

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, from post-marketing surveillance and case reports):**

* Deep vein thrombosis
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Serum sickness
* Thrombosis

If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
VZIG contains antibodies to the varicella-zoster virus.  These antibodies provide passive immunity, meaning they directly neutralize the virus, preventing or lessening the severity of infection.  Essentially, it temporarily boosts the body's ability to fight off the virus without stimulating the body to produce its own antibodies.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* History of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions to human immunoglobulins or any component of the formulation.
* IgA deficiency with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity.
* Evidence of immunity to varicella-zoster virus (prior infection or vaccination).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions and thrombotic events.
* Use with caution in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, history of atherosclerosis, advanced age, impaired cardiac output, coagulation disorders, prolonged immobilization, or known hyperviscosity disorders.
* Use with caution in patients with severe thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.
* Use with caution in elderly patients.
* VZIG may interfere with the response to live vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, polio); avoid live vaccines within 3 months of VZIG administration.
* Pregnancy Category C: Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is VZIG administered?** A: VZIG can be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), depending on the situation and patient factors.  Healthcare professionals determine the appropriate route and dosage.

* **Q: How long does VZIG protection last?** A: The duration of protection varies but is generally considered temporary, lasting several weeks.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.

* **Q: How should VZIG be stored?** A: VZIG should be stored as per the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.

* **Q: Is VZIG a cure for chickenpox or shingles?** A: No, VZIG is a preventive measure or an adjuvant treatment; it does not cure established infections.

* **Q: Can I receive VZIG if I've already had chickenpox?** A: No, VZIG is not indicated if you have already had chickenpox or been vaccinated against it.
