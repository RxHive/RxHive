# Vosoritide
### Generic Name
Vosoritide

### Usage
Vosoritide is a medication used to increase linear growth in children aged 5 years and older who have achondroplasia and still have open growth plates (epiphyses). Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that causes dwarfism.  Vosoritide works by affecting the body's natural growth processes, specifically targeting the pathways involved in bone growth in individuals with this condition.  It is currently not approved for use in other growth disorders or in adults.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The dosage of Vosoritide is determined by the child's weight and administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  Dosage adjustments are not provided for hepatic impairment, while for renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²), use is not recommended.  Always follow the healthcare provider's instructions and the manufacturer's prescribing information for accurate dosing.

**Achondroplasia (Children ≥ 5 years):**  The following dosages are guidelines and must be adjusted to the individual child's weight.  A healthcare professional will calculate the precise dose based on the child's weight.

* **10-11 kg:** 0.24 mg once daily
* **12-16 kg:** 0.28 mg once daily
* **17-21 kg:** 0.32 mg once daily
* **22-32 kg:** 0.4 mg once daily
* **33-43 kg:** 0.5 mg once daily
* **44-59 kg:** 0.6 mg once daily
* **60-89 kg:** 0.7 mg once daily
* **≥90 kg:** 0.8 mg once daily

The medication should be administered at roughly the same time each day.  If a dose is missed, it can be taken within 12 hours of the scheduled time.  After 12 hours, the missed dose should be skipped, and the next dose should be taken as usual.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Decreased blood pressure
* Gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines)
* Vomiting
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, hives)

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Dry skin
* Ear pain
* Influenza-like symptoms
* Seasonal allergies


**Serious Side Effects:** While less common,  serious side effects are possible.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

Vosoritide is a synthetic analog of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). In achondroplasia, a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene negatively regulates endochondral bone growth (the process by which long bones grow). Vosoritide binds to the natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B). This binding counteracts the effects of the FGFR3 mutation by inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathway (a signaling pathway involved in bone growth), ultimately promoting chondrocyte (cartilage cell) proliferation and differentiation, leading to increased bone growth.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Currently, there are no reported contraindications for Vosoritide listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Drug Interactions:** Information on specific drug interactions is limited; discuss all medications with your healthcare provider before starting Vosoritide.
* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** There is currently no data on Vosoritide use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The potential risks and benefits should be carefully considered by a healthcare professional.
* **Children Under 5:** The safety and effectiveness of Vosoritide in children under 5 years old with achondroplasia have not been established.
* **Low Blood Pressure:**  Vosoritide can cause a temporary decrease in blood pressure.  Patients should be monitored for symptoms such as dizziness, tiredness, and nausea, especially after initial administration. Adequate fluid intake and food before administration can help mitigate this risk.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Vosoritide administered?**  A: Vosoritide is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily. Injection sites should be rotated.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose within 12 hours. If more than 12 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular dosing schedule.
* **Q: How long will my child need to take Vosoritide?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the child's growth and the closure of their growth plates. Regular monitoring is crucial.
* **Q: What should I do if my child experiences side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if your child experiences any concerning side effects.
* **Q: How is Vosoritide stored?** A: Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific storage guidelines.  Generally, medication should be stored as directed on the product label.
* **Q: Is Vosoritide suitable for all children with achondroplasia?** A: No, Vosoritide is only indicated for children aged 5 years and older with achondroplasia who still have open growth plates (epiphyses).
