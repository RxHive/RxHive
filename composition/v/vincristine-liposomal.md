# Vincristine (Liposomal)
### Generic Name
Vincristine (Liposomal)

### Usage
Vincristine (liposomal) is a chemotherapy medication used to treat adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  It's specifically indicated for those experiencing a second or subsequent relapse of ALL, or for patients whose disease has progressed after two or more prior anti-leukemia therapies.  This liposomal formulation is *not* interchangeable with conventional vincristine; the dosages are significantly different.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** Vincristine (liposomal) and conventional vincristine are not interchangeable.  Dosage differs substantially between the two formulations; always verify the intended product and dose before preparation and administration.  The liposomal dosage is based on the patient's body surface area (BSA).

**Adult Dosage (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Relapsed, Philadelphia Chromosome-Negative):**

* Intravenous (IV) administration: 2.25 mg/mÂ² over 1 hour once every 7 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild or moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B), no dosage adjustment is typically recommended.  For severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments.  However, careful monitoring is essential.  Hepatotoxicity during treatment may necessitate dose reduction or treatment interruption.

* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for renal impairment.  Since vincristine (liposomal) is minimally excreted by the kidneys, adjustments may not be necessary, but close monitoring is advised.

* **Toxicity Management:**  Dose adjustments or treatment interruption are necessary depending on the severity of side effects.  Specifically for peripheral neuropathy, dose reduction is stepwise based on the grade of neuropathy, with discontinuation considered for persistent grade 3 or 4 toxicity.  Severe fatigue, hematologic toxicity (grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia) also require dose modification or treatment interruption.  Patients with pre-existing severe neuropathy or demyelinating conditions (like Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome) should not receive this medication.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Fatigue, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy (motor and sensory)
* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea
* Hematologic: Anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia
* Hepatic: Increased serum AST levels
* Other: Fever


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Mental status changes, myasthenia, pain
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension, septic shock
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, non-Hirschsprung megacolon
* Infection: Staphylococcal bacteremia
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Asthenia
* Respiratory: Pneumonia, respiratory distress, respiratory failure

**Rare Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Tumor lysis syndrome

**Post-marketing reports:** Blepharoptosis (drooping eyelids)

**Serious Side Effects:**  Always seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe or persistent side effects.  Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of severe neuropathy, bone marrow suppression, and hepatotoxicity.


### How it Works
Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid, a type of chemotherapy drug that works by interfering with the cell division process.  The liposomal formulation encapsulates the vincristine within liposomes (small fat globules), which increases its half-life in the body. This extended half-life leads to enhanced cytotoxic (cell-killing) activity against tumor cells, particularly in leukemic cells.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to vincristine, vincristine (liposomal), or any formulation component.
* Patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome or other demyelinating conditions.
* Intrathecal administration (injection into the spinal fluid) is strictly contraindicated and fatal.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **IV Administration Only:**  Vincristine (liposomal) is for intravenous use only.  Intrathecal or other routes of administration are fatal.
* **Do Not Interchange:**  Do not interchange vincristine (liposomal) with conventional vincristine.  Dosages are significantly different.
* **Bone marrow suppression, severe fatigue, constipation, ileus, bowel obstruction, colonic pseudo-obstruction, extravasation, hepatotoxicity (including fatal cases), and neuropathy (peripheral, central, and autonomic) are significant risks.**
* Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment and elderly patients.
* Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose.  Men should use contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose.
* Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.

**Drug Interactions:**  Strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, and P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 inducers or inhibitors, may significantly alter the serum concentration of vincristine (liposomal).  Avoid concomitant use of these medications.
