# Varicella Vaccine live attenuated
### Generic Name
Varicella Vaccine Live Attenuated

### Usage
The Varicella vaccine is primarily used to prevent chickenpox (varicella), a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).  This vaccine is highly effective in reducing the incidence and severity of chickenpox.  While its primary use is preventative, it can also be used in certain situations to provide immunity to individuals who have been exposed to chickenpox but haven't developed the illness.  In some cases, it may be considered for individuals who have a weakened immune system, though this would be determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician, and the efficacy may be reduced.


### Dosage

The recommended dosage of the varicella vaccine is typically administered as two subcutaneous injections.  The exact schedule varies depending on the specific vaccine formulation (e.g., single-dose or combination vaccine with MMR).  

* **For children:**  A typical schedule involves the first dose at 12-15 months of age, followed by a second dose at 4-6 years of age.  However, the exact schedule can differ and should be determined by a healthcare professional.
* **For adolescents and adults:**  Catch-up vaccination is recommended for adolescents and adults who haven't been previously vaccinated or who don't have documented evidence of chickenpox infection.  The number of doses and timing will depend on age and vaccination history and should be determined by a physician.

**Note:**  There is no oral form of the Varicella vaccine, and it's not typically administered intravenously (IV).  The vaccine is always administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  Specific dosage instructions are always provided by the healthcare professional administering the vaccine and should be followed precisely.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of the varicella vaccine are generally mild and self-limiting.  These can include:

* Redness, swelling, or pain at the injection site
* Low-grade fever
* Mild rash
* Headache
* Tiredness

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible, although rare.  These include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe)
* Seizures
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)


If any concerning side effects occur, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

The Varicella vaccine contains a live, attenuated (weakened) form of the varicella-zoster virus.  This weakened virus is not strong enough to cause chickenpox, but it's capable of stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies provide long-lasting immunity, protecting individuals from future infection with chickenpox.

### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with a known allergy to neomycin, gelatin, or any component of the vaccine should not receive it.  A history of severe allergic reactions to any vaccine is also a contraindication.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  The vaccine should be used cautiously in individuals with weakened immune systems (e.g., due to HIV infection, cancer treatment, or other conditions) as the weakened virus could potentially cause illness.  The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed by a healthcare professional.
* **Pregnancy:**  The vaccine is generally not recommended during pregnancy.  Pregnant women should discuss vaccination with their doctor before and after pregnancy.
* **Interactions with other medications:** There are some interactions with other medications such as immunosuppressants that should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
* **Storage:** The vaccine must be stored according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, typically refrigerated.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is the varicella vaccine safe?**  A: Yes, the varicella vaccine is generally considered safe and highly effective. Like all vaccines, there is a small risk of side effects, but serious side effects are rare.

* **Q: How long does immunity last after vaccination?** A:  Immunity generally lasts for many years, but booster doses may be recommended in certain circumstances, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

* **Q: Can I get chickenpox after receiving the vaccine?** A: It's possible to get a mild case of chickenpox after vaccination (breakthrough infection), but this is uncommon and typically much less severe than in unvaccinated individuals.

* **Q: What should I do if my child develops a fever after the vaccine?** A: A low-grade fever is a common side effect.  If the fever is high or your child seems unwell, consult your doctor.

* **Q:  Can I receive the varicella vaccine if I'm already pregnant?** A: No, the vaccine is generally not recommended during pregnancy.  Discuss vaccination plans with your doctor.
