# Varicella Vaccine live attenuated

**Generic Name:** Varicella Virus Vaccine, Live

**Usage:**  Prevention of chickenpox (varicella) in susceptible individuals.  This includes routine vaccination of infants and children, as well as vaccination of susceptible adolescents and adults who haven't had chickenpox or been vaccinated previously.  The specific schedule and age recommendations may vary depending on the country and public health guidelines.  Postexposure prophylaxis (to prevent or lessen the severity of chickenpox after exposure) may also be considered in certain high-risk individuals, as directed by a healthcare provider.

**Side Effects:**  Most side effects are mild and temporary.  Common side effects include:

* **Local reactions:**  Pain, redness, swelling, and itching at the injection site.  A small, raised, red bump (papule) or a blister may develop.
* **Systemic reactions:**  Fever, rash (not necessarily chickenpox-like), headache, fatigue, muscle aches, and mild abdominal pain.

More serious, but rare, side effects include:

* **Shingles (Herpes Zoster):**  A rare complication that can occur years after vaccination in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Disseminated Varicella:**  Widespread chickenpox infection.  More likely in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur.


**How it Works:** The vaccine contains a live, weakened (attenuated) form of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).  After vaccination, the weakened virus replicates minimally in the body, triggering an immune response.  This immune response produces antibodies that protect against future infection with wild-type VZV, thus preventing or significantly reducing the severity of chickenpox.  The immune response usually results in a low-level antibody response, sufficient enough to provide immunity and only rarely resulting in the development of a mild case of chickenpox.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is the vaccine safe?** A:  Yes, the varicella vaccine is generally considered very safe and effective.  The benefits significantly outweigh the risks for most people.  However, like any vaccine, there's a small risk of side effects.
* **Q: Can I get chickenpox from the vaccine?** A:  It's possible to develop a mild case of chickenpox after vaccination (breakthrough infection), but it's usually much milder than naturally acquired chickenpox.  This is typically a localized rash and is rare.
* **Q: Who shouldn't get the vaccine?** A:  People with severe allergic reactions to gelatin or neomycin (or any component of the vaccine), individuals with severely compromised immune systems (e.g., those with leukemia, lymphoma, or receiving high-dose corticosteroids), pregnant women (although generally safe post-partum), and people currently experiencing a severe illness. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine your eligibility.
* **Q: How effective is the vaccine?** A:  The vaccine is highly effective in preventing chickenpox.  The efficacy may vary slightly depending on the specific vaccine and the individual.
* **Q: How many doses are needed?** A: Typically two doses are recommended, given according to a specific schedule determined by health authorities.
* **Q: What if I've already had chickenpox?** A: You don't need the vaccine if you've already had chickenpox.  A blood test can confirm previous infection.
