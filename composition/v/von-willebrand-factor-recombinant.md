# von Willebrand Factor Recombinant
### Generic Name
von Willebrand Factor Recombinant

### Usage

von Willebrand factor (recombinant) is a medication used to treat von Willebrand disease (VWD) in adults.  VWD is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a protein crucial for blood clotting. This medication is indicated for several purposes:

* **On-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes:**  This is the primary use, helping to stop or control bleeding episodes as they occur.  The severity of the dose depends on the severity of the bleeding episode.

* **Perioperative management of bleeding:** This helps manage bleeding during and after surgical procedures.  Preoperative administration aims to maintain sufficient VWF levels during and after surgery to minimize bleeding complications.

* **Routine prophylaxis to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes:** For patients with severe type 3 VWD who are already receiving on-demand treatment, this medication can be used to prevent bleeding episodes from happening in the first place.  This is a preventative measure, unlike on-demand treatment which addresses bleeding already occurring.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized based on the patient's weight, the type and severity of VWD, the type of bleeding episode (minor or major), and the need for surgical intervention.  Monitoring of VWF and factor VIII levels (VWF:RCo and FVIII:C) is critical for determining appropriate dosage and treatment duration. The medication is administered intravenously (IV).

**Adults:**

* **On-demand treatment:** Doses range from 40-80 units/kg depending on the severity of bleeding (minor or major).  Maintenance doses may be required every 8-24 hours as clinically needed. Factor VIII may also be administered concurrently, especially in cases of major bleeding or if FVIII levels are low.

* **Routine prophylaxis:**  Initial doses are typically 40-60 units/kg twice weekly. Dosage may be adjusted up to 60 units/kg twice weekly based on the occurrence of breakthrough bleeding.

* **Perioperative management:** Dosage is complex and requires careful calculation based on baseline VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels, target levels, and incremental recovery (IR).  Preoperative assessment is crucial to determine the necessary loading dose and subsequent maintenance regimen.  The goal is to maintain sufficient VWF and FVIII levels throughout the perioperative period.  Refer to the prescribing information for detailed formulas and guidelines.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of von Willebrand factor (recombinant) have not been established in children under 18 years of age.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Vertigo
* Chest discomfort
* Hypertension
* Tachycardia
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dysgeusia (distorted taste)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Hot flashes
* Infusion-site reaction
* Tremor


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema)
* Thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke)
* Development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to VWF and/or factor VIII


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or unusual ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

von Willebrand factor (recombinant) works by replacing the missing or dysfunctional VWF in individuals with VWD.  VWF plays a critical role in hemostasis (stopping bleeding) by mediating platelet adhesion (platelets sticking together) and acting as a carrier protein for factor VIII, another crucial clotting factor.  By increasing VWF levels, this medication helps to improve platelet function and enhance the clotting process, thereby controlling or preventing bleeding episodes.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with a history of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to von Willebrand factor (recombinant) or any of its components.

* **Increased Risk:** Patients using this medication are at an increased risk of thromboembolic events (blood clots) and hypersensitivity reactions.  Close monitoring is necessary.

* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are possible.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, that you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Use in pregnancy and lactation requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks.  The safety and efficacy in children have not been established.

* **Administration:**  Intravenous administration should be slow (maximum rate 4 mL/min) to minimize the risk of adverse effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for von Willebrand factor (recombinant) to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the dose and individual patient factors, but effects are typically seen within a short time after intravenous administration.

* **Q: How is von Willebrand factor (recombinant) stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions, which typically involve refrigeration.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with von Willebrand factor (recombinant)?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known, but ongoing monitoring is vital to detect any potential issues, including the development of inhibitors.

* **Q: Can I take von Willebrand factor (recombinant) if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of von Willebrand factor (recombinant)?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on missed doses, particularly with prophylactic regimens.  Do not double the dose.
