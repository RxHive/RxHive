# Viloxazine
### Generic Name
Viloxazine

### Usage
Viloxazine is primarily used to treat two distinct conditions:

*   **Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents:** It helps manage the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity characteristic of ADHD in children aged 6 to 17 years.  The effectiveness in younger children hasn't been established.

*   **Depression in adults:** Viloxazine is used as an antidepressant to alleviate symptoms such as sadness, loss of interest, changes in sleep or appetite, and fatigue.

### Dosage

**Adults (Depression):**

*   The usual starting dose is 200-300 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses.  
*   The dose may be increased to a maximum of 600 mg daily, depending on individual tolerance and response.  
*   Older adults should start with a lower dose (100 mg daily) and titration should be performed cautiously.

**Children and Adolescents (ADHD):**

*   **Ages 6-11:** The starting dose is typically 100 mg once daily.  The dose can be increased by 100 mg weekly, as needed, based on response and tolerability. The maximum daily dose is 400 mg.

*   **Ages 12-17:** The starting dose is typically 200 mg once daily.  The dose can be increased to 400 mg after one week, if tolerated and needed, based on response. The maximum daily dose is 400 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use in adults with hepatic impairment requires careful dose titration, starting with 100mg/day.  It's generally not recommended for children and adolescents with hepatic impairment due to the lack of data on pharmacokinetic effects.

*   **Renal Impairment:**  For adults with renal impairment, start with 100 mg/day and titrate cautiously. In children and adolescents with mild to moderate impairment (eGFR 30-89 mL/min/1.73 m²), no adjustment is usually needed. Those with severe impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²) should start with 100 mg once daily, with increments of 50-100 mg weekly as needed, to a maximum of 200 mg daily.


**Administration:** Viloxazine is usually taken orally. Capsules should be swallowed whole or, if necessary, opened and sprinkled onto a spoonful of applesauce and immediately consumed. Do not chew or crush the capsules.

### How it Works

Viloxazine's exact mechanism of action in treating ADHD isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to primarily work by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter in the brain. This increase in norepinephrine levels is thought to improve attention, reduce hyperactivity, and alleviate depressive symptoms.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Viloxazine is contraindicated in patients currently taking or who have recently stopped taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within the last two weeks.  It is also contraindicated in patients with porphyria, recent myocardial infarction, and those sensitive to CYP1A2 substrates.

*   **Drug Interactions:** Viloxazine can interact with various medications, including antihypertensives, alcohol, anticoagulants (like acenocoumarol), and other drugs metabolized by the liver. It can also increase the levels of certain medications like carbamazepine, theophylline, aminophylline, and phenytoin, potentially leading to toxicity. The concomitant use of an MAOI with Viloxazine is contraindicated due to a risk of hypertensive crisis.

*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Consider discontinuing Viloxazine if pregnancy occurs.  The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration of risks and benefits before breastfeeding while on Viloxazine.

*   **Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors:**  There is an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, particularly in children and adolescents with ADHD. Close monitoring is essential.

*   **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with bipolar disorder, renal or hepatic impairment, cardiovascular disease, or epilepsy.  Viloxazine should be withdrawn gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I drive while taking Viloxazine?**  A: No, as drowsiness is a common side effect. Avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.

*   **Q: How should I store Viloxazine?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking Viloxazine suddenly?** A: No, abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication.

*   **Q: Does Viloxazine affect weight?** A: Weight changes are possible; regular monitoring is advised.
