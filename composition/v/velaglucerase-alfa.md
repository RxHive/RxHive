# Velaglucerase Alfa
### Generic Name
Velaglucerase Alfa

### Usage
Velaglucerase alfa is a prescription medication used for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.  This disease is a genetic disorder resulting in the buildup of glucocerebroside, a fatty substance, in cells, particularly in the liver, spleen, and bones.  Velaglucerase alfa works to break down this substance, alleviating the symptoms associated with Gaucher disease.  The primary use is to manage the symptoms of type 1 Gaucher disease, and it's not currently approved for other types.

### Dosage
**Gaucher Disease Type I:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥4 years:** The recommended dose is 60 Units/kg administered intravenously (IV) every two weeks over one hour.  Pre-medication with non-sedating antihistamines, with or without antipyretics, 30-60 minutes before infusion is typically recommended.  When switching from imiglucerase to velaglucerase alfa in stable patients, begin treatment two weeks after the last dose of imiglucerase at the same dose.

* **Children <4 years:** The safety and efficacy of velaglucerase alfa in children under 4 years old have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
The following are potential side effects of Velaglucerase alfa.  The frequency is categorized as follows:  >10% indicates a high likelihood, 1-10% signifies a moderate likelihood. Note that this is not an exhaustive list.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Asthenia (weakness or fatigue)
* Fatigue
* Abdominal pain
* Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT, a blood clotting test)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Back pain
* Joint pain (especially knee pain)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Fever

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Flushing
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Nausea
* Skin rash (more common in children)
* Urticaria (hives)


**Serious Side Effects (Less Frequent):** While less common, serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reaction (such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).

**Note:** If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Velaglucerase alfa is a recombinant human enzyme that replaces the deficient enzyme found in patients with Gaucher disease.  The deficient enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of glucocerebroside, a fatty substance that accumulates in cells causing damage.  Velaglucerase alfa functions as a substitute enzyme, catalyzing the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide. By facilitating this breakdown, it reduces the accumulation of glucocerebroside and consequently alleviates the symptoms of Gaucher disease, such as an enlarged spleen and liver (hepatosplenomegaly), anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and bone problems.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Velaglucerase alfa is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medication or its components.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-related reactions.  Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to velaglucerase alfa or other enzyme replacement therapies.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Velaglucerase alfa is classified as Pregnancy Category B.  The excretion of this drug in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:** While there are no known significant drug interactions, it's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
