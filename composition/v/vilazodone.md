# Vilazodone
### Generic Name
Vilazodone

### Usage

Vilazodone is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's an antidepressant that works differently than many other medications in its class.  It's important to note that Vilazodone is *not* approved for the treatment of bipolar depression.  A healthcare professional should carefully evaluate a patient's condition before prescribing it.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Treatment for major depressive disorder typically begins with a 10mg oral dose once daily for seven days.  This dose can be increased to 20mg once daily, and further to a maximum of 40mg once daily.  Increases should be spaced at least seven days apart to monitor for side effects. The usual maintenance dose ranges from 20mg to 40mg daily.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Vilazodone haven't been established in children.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in certain situations. For patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, typically no dosage adjustment is needed. However, careful monitoring is crucial. Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (like itraconazole, clarithromycin, or voriconazole) may require lowering the Vilazodone dose to a maximum of 20mg daily. Conversely, concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers (like carbamazepine, phenytoin, or rifampin) might necessitate a dosage increase, up to a maximum of 80mg daily, after careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.  Switching between Vilazodone and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant requires a minimum 14-day washout period between medications to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.

### How it Works

Vilazodone's exact mechanism of action in treating depression isn't completely understood, but it's believed to work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain.  It achieves this by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in mood regulation. Vilazodone also acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, although the full impact of this action on its antidepressant effect isn't fully clarified.  Essentially, Vilazodone helps to restore a balance of serotonin in the brain, which can alleviate symptoms of depression.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Vilazodone should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.  It's absolutely contraindicated within 14 days of stopping or starting a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).

* **Interactions:**  Vilazodone can interact with various medications, including other antidepressants (especially SSRIs, SNRIs, and MAOIs), CNS-active drugs, drugs affecting hemostasis (blood clotting), and certain CYP enzyme inhibitors and inducers. Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Concurrent use with MAOIs is particularly dangerous and must be avoided.

* **Warnings:** Vilazodone carries a boxed warning about increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in young adults (under 24).  Careful monitoring is essential, particularly at the start of treatment and when dosages are adjusted. There's also an increased risk of serotonin syndrome, abnormal bleeding, activation of mania/hypomania, hyponatremia, seizures, discontinuation syndrome, bone fractures, and ocular effects.  Use caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions predisposing to seizures.  Pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using this medication, as it may increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and withdrawal symptoms in newborns.  The effects of Vilazodone on breastfeeding are not fully known.
