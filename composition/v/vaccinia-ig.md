# Vaccinia Ig
### Generic Name
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (Vaccinia Ig)

### Usage
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (Vaccinia Ig) is a concentrated solution of antibodies derived from the plasma of people who have been vaccinated against smallpox.  Its primary use is in the treatment of serious complications arising from vaccinia vaccination. These complications include:

* **Eczema vaccinatum:** A severe skin infection occurring in individuals with eczema or other skin conditions after smallpox vaccination.
* **Progressive vaccinia:**  A condition where the vaccinia virus infection spreads beyond the vaccination site and worsens.
* **Severe generalized vaccinia:** Widespread vaccinia infection affecting multiple areas of the body.
* **Vaccinia infections in individuals with pre-existing skin conditions:**  Individuals with skin conditions are at higher risk of severe complications from vaccinia vaccination, and Vaccinia Ig is used to manage these infections.
* **Aberrant vaccinia infections:** Infections caused by the vaccinia virus that spread beyond the typical localized reaction.

It's crucial to understand that Vaccinia Ig is *not* indicated for isolated vaccinia keratitis (infection of the cornea) or postvaccinial encephalitis (brain inflammation).


### Dosage
Vaccinia Ig is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage is determined based on body weight and the severity of the condition.

**Adults:** The recommended initial dose is 6000 units/kg.  This dose may be repeated depending on the patient's response and the severity of their symptoms. In cases where the initial dose is ineffective, a higher dose of 9000 units/kg may be considered.  Doses as high as 24,000 units/kg have been used in healthy volunteers, but caution is advised, especially in individuals with risk factors for thrombosis (blood clots). For such patients, the maximum daily dose should not exceed 12,000 units/kg.

**Children (Adolescents â‰¥16 years):**  The dosage for adolescents aged 16 years and older is the same as for adults.  Dosage for younger children is not explicitly defined in standard guidelines and requires consultation with a specialist.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.  In these cases, the infusion rate and concentration should be reduced, the patient should be well-hydrated, and the treatment should be stopped if kidney function deteriorates.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:** The frequency of these side effects is not precisely defined but they are generally reported.

* Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, pain, paresthesia (numbness or tingling), chills, rigors (shaking chills).
* Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities).
* Dermatologic: Erythema (redness), diaphoresis (sweating), pallor (paleness).
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite.
* Local: Injection site reactions.
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Back pain, muscle spasms, tremor, weakness.
* General: Fever.


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** These side effects are reported less frequently but can be serious:

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Aseptic meningitis (inflammation of the brain membranes)
* Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs)
* Acute renal failure (sudden kidney failure)
* Thromboembolic events (blood clots)
* Other serious reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

If any adverse effects occur, immediately seek medical attention.


### How it Works
Vaccinia Ig works by providing passive immunity against the vaccinia virus.  It contains high concentrations of antibodies specifically targeting the vaccinia virus. These antibodies bind to the virus, preventing it from infecting cells and reducing the severity of the infection.  The precise mechanisms involved are not fully understood.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Vaccinia Ig is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or severe reactions to human immune globulins, those with isolated vaccinia keratitis, and IgA-deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of IgA hypersensitivity.

* **Interactions:** Vaccinia Ig may interfere with the effectiveness of live vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, polio).  Live vaccines should not be given for at least 3 months after Vaccinia Ig administration.

* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), aseptic meningitis, hemolysis, pulmonary edema, acute renal dysfunction, thrombotic events, and infusion reactions.  Extra caution is advised in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency, cardiovascular risk factors, or those at risk for hyperviscosity (thick blood).  Elderly patients should also be monitored closely.  Patients with diabetes must use glucose-specific methods for blood glucose monitoring because the maltose in Vaccinia Ig can interfere with some glucose testing systems, leading to inaccurate results.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Vaccinia Ig is categorized as pregnancy category C (potential risk to the fetus). The excretion of Vaccinia Ig in breast milk is unknown, therefore, caution should be used if administering to a breastfeeding mother.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Vaccinia Ig stored?** A: Storage instructions will be provided by the manufacturer and should be followed carefully. Typically, it involves refrigeration.

* **Q: How long does it take for Vaccinia Ig to work?** A: The onset of action varies but the therapeutic benefit is typically seen relatively quickly once administered.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while receiving Vaccinia Ig?** A: It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you miss a dose or have any questions regarding your treatment. Do not attempt to self-adjust the dosage.

* **Q:  Are there long-term effects associated with Vaccinia Ig?** A:  Long-term effects are rare, but close monitoring is necessary, especially for renal and cardiovascular function.  Any concerns should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
