# Valsartan

**Generic Name:** Valsartan

**Usage:**

Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It's prescribed to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  Valsartan lowers blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.
* **Heart failure:** It helps improve heart function and reduce symptoms in patients with heart failure.
* **Prevention of cardiovascular events:** In high-risk patients (those with a history of heart attack or stroke), it can reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.
* **Diabetic nephropathy:**  It slows the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.


**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, valsartan can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is often mild and resolves as the body adjusts to the medication.
* **Headache:**  Similar to dizziness, headaches often subside.
* **Upper respiratory infection:**  Increased susceptibility to common colds.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Muscle cramps:**  Pain or spasms in muscles.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can cause lightheadedness or fainting.

**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):**  Can be dangerous if left untreated.
* **Kidney problems:**  Impaired kidney function.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
* **Angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat â€“ a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.
* **Cough:**  Less common with ARBs than ACE inhibitors.


**How it Works:**

Valsartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, valsartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and reduces strain on the heart.  This also improves blood flow to the kidneys and heart.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking valsartan?**  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally fine, but excessive alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor.
* **Can I take valsartan with other medications?**  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Some interactions are possible.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to see the full effects of valsartan on blood pressure.
* **Can I stop taking valsartan suddenly?** No, you should never stop taking valsartan abruptly.  Stopping suddenly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue the medication.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
