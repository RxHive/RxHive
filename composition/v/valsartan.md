# Valsartan
### Generic Name
Valsartan

### Usage
Valsartan is primarily an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.  Beyond hypertension, Valsartan also plays a significant role in managing heart failure (specifically NYHA class II-IV), reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction (heart attack), and managing proteinuric chronic kidney disease (both diabetic and non-diabetic).  It's important to note that its use in chronic kidney disease is often considered off-label, meaning it's not explicitly approved by regulatory bodies for this purpose but is frequently used by clinicians due to its efficacy in reducing proteinuria (protein in the urine).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's response. Always follow a physician's prescription.  The information below is for general knowledge and should not be substituted for medical advice.

* **Hypertension:**  Starting dose typically ranges from 80-160 mg once daily (OD). The dose may be adjusted every 4-6 weeks based on response, up to a maximum of 320 mg OD.
* **Heart Failure:** Initial dose usually starts at 20-40 mg twice daily (BID), and this can be carefully increased (usually doubled) every 1-2 weeks depending on the patient's response and tolerance.  The maximum dose may reach 80-160 mg BID.
* **Post-Myocardial Infarction:**  Treatment may begin as early as 12 hours after a heart attack, starting with 20 mg BID. This might be increased to 40 mg BID within a week, with a maximum of 160 mg BID.
* **Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease:**  The initial dosage usually ranges from 40-80 mg BID, adjusted based on blood pressure response and tolerance, up to a maximum of 160 mg BID.  The goal is to achieve appropriate blood pressure and proteinuria targets.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Valsartan's safety and efficacy in children under 6 years old haven't been fully established.  Dosages for older children and adolescents vary greatly depending on age, weight, and the condition being treated, and are typically prescribed as oral solutions or tablets with different concentration recommendations.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions carefully.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for mild to moderate impairment, but caution is advised. For severe impairment, dosage adjustments aren't specifically defined in product labeling; close monitoring is crucial.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  No adjustment is generally needed for creatinine clearance (CrCl) above 30 mL/min. For CrCl below 30 mL/min, dosage adjustments aren't specified in the product labeling.  Careful monitoring is essential.  Valsartan isn't significantly removed by dialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels

**Less Common but Potentially Significant Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Vertigo
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in blood)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Dry cough
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Renal insufficiency

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (Less than 1%, often from post-marketing surveillance):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Hepatic dysfunction (liver problems)
* Renal failure
* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
* Various allergic reactions


**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Valsartan is a selective angiotensin II receptor blocker. Angiotensin II is a hormone that constricts blood vessels, raising blood pressure. Valsartan prevents angiotensin II from binding to its receptors, thus reducing the constriction of blood vessels and lowering blood pressure.  This also helps reduce the strain on the heart, which is beneficial in heart failure. Its effect on reducing proteinuria in kidney disease is related to the reduction in pressure within the kidneys.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Valsartan is contraindicated in individuals hypersensitive to valsartan or any formulation component, concomitant use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Valsartan can interact with various drugs, including ACE inhibitors, other antihypertensives, NSAIDs, potassium supplements, and potassium-sparing diuretics.  These interactions can increase the risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, or reduced efficacy. Close monitoring is needed when taking Valsartan with other medications.  The concomitant use of aliskiren is contraindicated.
* **Pregnancy:** Valsartan is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it can cause significant harm to the developing fetus.  It should be discontinued immediately upon pregnancy detection.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with kidney or liver problems.  Careful monitoring of renal function and blood pressure is needed.
* **Hypotension:** Valsartan can cause hypotension, particularly at the initiation of therapy or when combined with other blood pressure-lowering agents.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Valsartan with other medications?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  Valsartan can interact with other drugs, and adjustments may be needed.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's close to the time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store Valsartan?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Specific storage instructions may be on the product labeling.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Valsartan suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking Valsartan suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can cause rebound hypertension.
* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above.
