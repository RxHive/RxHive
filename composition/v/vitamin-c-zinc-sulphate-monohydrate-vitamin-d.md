# Vitamin C + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:** Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol)

**Usage:** This combination is often used to support immune function.  Each component plays a distinct role:

* **Vitamin C:**  A powerful antioxidant that supports immune system function, collagen production, and iron absorption. It's often used to help reduce the duration and severity of colds.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Zinc is essential for immune cell function, wound healing, and cell growth. It plays a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune responses.
* **Vitamin D:** Important for immune regulation, calcium absorption, and bone health.  It has immunomodulatory effects, influencing both the innate and adaptive immune systems.

The combination is often taken during cold and flu season or when immune support is desired.  However, it's crucial to understand that it is **not a cure** for any illness.  It's best used as a preventative measure or supportive therapy alongside other appropriate treatments.  Dosage should always follow the product's instructions or recommendations from a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally mild and infrequent but can include:

* **Vitamin C:** Diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, heartburn (at high doses).
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, loss of appetite (at high doses).  Long-term high doses can interfere with copper absorption.
* **Vitamin D:**  High doses can lead to hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), which can cause symptoms like kidney stones, fatigue, constipation, and nausea.

It's vital to follow recommended dosages to minimize the risk of side effects.  Individuals with pre-existing conditions should consult a doctor before taking this combination.

**How it Works:**

Each ingredient works independently but synergistically to support immune function:

* **Vitamin C:** Acts as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and supporting immune cell activity.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Plays a crucial role in various immune cell functions, including cell signaling and activation.
* **Vitamin D:** Modulates immune responses by influencing the differentiation and activity of immune cells, reducing inflammation, and potentially enhancing antiviral defenses.
