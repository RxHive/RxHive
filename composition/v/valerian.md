# Valerian
### Generic Name
Valerian

### Usage
Valerian is an herb primarily used to address sleep disorders, most commonly insomnia.  While it's often touted as a sleep aid and is frequently combined with other herbs like hops or lemon balm to enhance its effects,  the level of clinical evidence supporting its effectiveness for insomnia remains limited.  It's important to remember that valerian is not a substitute for proper sleep hygiene or treatment of underlying medical conditions contributing to sleep problems.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The precise dosage of valerian isn't definitively established.  Current recommendations, based on available clinical trials, suggest taking 400-600 mg of valerian extract orally, about one hour before bedtime.  This dosage should be followed for 2-4 weeks.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's guidance on dosage.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  There are no established dosage recommendations for children.  Valerian should not be given to children without the express advice and supervision of a pediatrician.

### Side Effects
The frequency of side effects associated with valerian is not well-defined. However, reported side effects include:

* Cardiac disturbances
* Excitability
* Headache
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage - rare but serious)
* Insomnia (ironically, in some cases)
* Morning drowsiness
* Sedation
* Uneasiness
* Withdrawal syndrome (with prolonged use)

If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Valerian's mechanism of action is thought to be similar to that of benzodiazepines, a class of drugs used to treat anxiety and insomnia. However, unlike benzodiazepines, valerian appears to bind to the beta subunit rather than the gamma subunit of the GABA-A receptor in the brain.  GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses, promoting relaxation and sleep. By interacting with GABA receptors, valerian may enhance GABA's inhibitory effects, leading to feelings of relaxation and improved sleep.  The exact mechanisms are still under investigation.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of valerian during pregnancy and breastfeeding haven't been established.  It's best to avoid valerian during these periods unless explicitly advised otherwise by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:** Valerian may interact with certain medications, particularly those that affect the central nervous system (CNS), such as sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Liver Issues:**  Individuals with pre-existing liver conditions should exercise caution and consult their doctor before using valerian, due to the potential risk of hepatotoxicity.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Valerian can cause drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.
