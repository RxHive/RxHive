# Valganciclovir
### Generic Name
Valganciclovir

### Usage
Valganciclovir is primarily used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections.  CMV is a common herpes virus that usually doesn't cause problems in people with healthy immune systems. However, in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those who have undergone organ transplantation, CMV can cause serious illnesses. Valganciclovir is particularly effective against CMV retinitis (infection of the retina), a potentially blinding condition.  It's also used to prevent CMV disease in organ transplant recipients at high risk of developing the infection.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **CMV Retinitis:**
    * **Oral:** Induction (active retinitis): 900 mg twice daily for 21 days.  Maintenance: 900 mg once daily.
* **Prevention of CMV Disease Following Transplantation:** 900 mg once daily, starting within 10 days of transplantation. Duration varies depending on the type of transplant (100 days for heart or kidney-pancreas transplants; 200 days for kidney transplants).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children varies significantly based on age, weight, and creatinine clearance (CrCl), a measure of kidney function.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions carefully.  Generally:

* **Prevention of CMV Disease Following Kidney or Heart Transplantation:** Oral administration.  Dosage is calculated using body surface area (BSA) and CrCl.  The maximum daily dose is 900 mg.  Infants under 4 months old should not receive Valganciclovir unless specifically directed by a physician as safety and efficacy haven't been established in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function.  These adjustments depend on creatinine clearance (CrCl) and whether it's an induction or maintenance dose.  Refer to specific guidelines provided by a healthcare professional or the medication's package insert for detailed instructions on dose reduction in patients with impaired kidney function.  In patients with severely reduced CrCl, the use of valganciclovir may not be recommended.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Valganciclovir is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, ganciclovir, in the body. Ganciclovir interferes with the ability of the CMV virus to replicate its DNA. Specifically, ganciclovir is phosphorylated inside infected cells and then competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate, a building block of DNA, for binding to viral DNA polymerase. This process inhibits viral DNA synthesis, preventing the virus from multiplying and thus controlling the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Valganciclovir is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to valganciclovir or ganciclovir, those undergoing hemodialysis, those with severely low white blood cell counts or hemoglobin levels, liver transplant recipients, and those concurrently taking zidovudine.
* **Warnings:** Valganciclovir can cause serious blood disorders (leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia), bone marrow suppression, and renal failure.  Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor these effects.  It's also potentially teratogenic (harmful to a developing fetus) and embryotoxic (harmful to an embryo), so it's contraindicated during pregnancy unless strictly deemed necessary by a physician.  Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 90 days afterward.
* **Drug Interactions:** Valganciclovir may interact with other medications, particularly those that are nephrotoxic (harmful to the kidneys) or affect bone marrow function.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:**  Patients with impaired kidney or liver function, the elderly, and children require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Valganciclovir?** A:  No, alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking Valganciclovir, as it can add stress to the liver and kidneys, which are already potentially affected by the medication.

* **Q: How should I store Valganciclovir?** A: Store Valganciclovir at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Consult your physician if you have concerns about missed doses.

* **Q: When should I contact my doctor?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual side effects, particularly those related to blood counts or kidney function, or if your CMV symptoms worsen.  Also contact your physician if you experience significant gastrointestinal upset, as this may need adjustment in taking the medication.
