# Vericiguat
### Generic Name
Vericiguat

### Usage
Vericiguat is a medication used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization due to heart failure in adults.  Specifically, it's indicated for patients who have recently been hospitalized for heart failure or required outpatient intravenous diuretics, and for those with symptomatic chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction (less than 45%).  It's used as an *adjunctive* therapy, meaning it's added to other standard heart failure treatments, not used as a standalone treatment.

### Dosage
**Adults:** Vericiguat is administered orally.  The starting dose is typically 2.5 mg once daily with food.  The dose is gradually increased, usually at two-week intervals, to 5 mg once daily and then to a target maintenance dose of 10 mg once daily, as tolerated by the patient.  The medication should be taken with food. If a patient cannot swallow the tablet whole, it can be crushed and mixed with water immediately before administration.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of vericiguat in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), no dosage adjustment is typically necessary.  However,  dosage adjustments for patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C) or those with significantly impaired kidney function (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) or on dialysis are not established and further guidance should be sought from a healthcare provider.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)

**Other Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Anemia


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:** While less frequent, serious side effects can occur. It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to a doctor immediately.  These can include, but are not limited to, severe allergic reactions or worsening heart failure.

### How it Works
Vericiguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator.  sGC is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating blood vessel tone. Vericiguat works by directly stimulating sGC, increasing the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).  Increased cGMP levels lead to relaxation of smooth muscles in blood vessels, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This improved blood flow reduces the workload on the heart, benefiting patients with heart failure. Vericiguat also enhances the sensitivity of sGC to nitric oxide (NO), further boosting cGMP production.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Vericiguat is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients who are also taking other soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (like riociguat) and in pregnant women.

**Warnings:**  There is a boxed warning about embryo-fetal toxicity.  Vericiguat can cause harm to a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and use effective contraception during treatment and for one month after the final dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking vericiguat.

**Drug Interactions:**  Consult a healthcare provider about potential interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting blood pressure or kidney function.

**Specific Populations:**  Care should be taken when prescribing vericiguat to older adults or patients with pre-existing kidney or liver disease.  Close monitoring is needed in these populations.
