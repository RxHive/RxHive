# Vericiguat

**Generic Name:** Vericiguat

**Usage:** Vericiguat is used to reduce the risk of worsening heart failure and cardiovascular death in adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who have recently experienced a worsening of their heart failure.  It's typically used in combination with other heart failure medications.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.
* **Headache:** A fairly common side effect.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can be mild to moderate.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Shortness of breath:**  May be worsened in some individuals.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling unsteady or faint.
* **Fatigue (tiredness):**  Feeling unusually tired.
* **Back pain:**  Aching or stiffness in the back.
* **Cough:**  A persistent cough.


**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention and include:**

* **Severe hypotension (very low blood pressure):** Requiring immediate medical intervention.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Such as rash, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Increased creatinine levels (kidney problems):**  Indicating potential kidney damage.
* **Worsening heart failure:** Increased symptoms of heart failure.


**How it Works:** Vericiguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator.  sGC is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood vessels and the heart. By stimulating sGC, vericiguat increases the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP), a messenger molecule that helps relax and widen blood vessels. This leads to several beneficial effects in heart failure:

* **Improved blood flow:** Reduced resistance to blood flow in the circulatory system.
* **Reduced blood pressure:** Lowering the strain on the heart.
* **Improved cardiac output:** The heart pumps more blood with each beat.
* **Reduced cardiac workload:**  Less strain on the heart muscle.

This overall improvement in cardiovascular function helps reduce the risk of worsening heart failure and death.
