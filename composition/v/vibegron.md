# Vibegron
### Generic Name
Vibegron

### Usage
Vibegron is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB) in adults.  OAB is characterized by a group of symptoms including urgency (a sudden, strong urge to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than usual), and urge incontinence (leaking urine because of a sudden, strong urge to urinate). Vibegron helps manage these symptoms by relaxing the bladder muscle, allowing it to hold more urine.  It's important to note that Vibegron does not treat the underlying cause of OAB, but rather helps manage the symptoms.

### Dosage
The recommended adult dosage for overactive bladder is 75 mg once daily (OD), taken orally.  This can be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water, or crushed and mixed with a tablespoon of applesauce and swallowed immediately.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B).  Vibegron is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to <90 mL/minute/1.73 m²). Vibegron is not recommended for patients with end-stage kidney disease (eGFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m²) with or without hemodialysis.
* **Pediatric Population:** The safety and efficacy of Vibegron in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Hot flashes
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Increased post-void residual urine volume
* Urinary retention
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Upper respiratory tract infection

Less common, but potentially serious side effects reported post-marketing include:

* Eczema
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash
* Fixed drug eruption (a type of hypersensitivity reaction)

If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Vibegron is a selective beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist. This means it works by activating specific receptors (beta-3 adrenergic receptors) in the bladder.  Activation of these receptors leads to relaxation of the detrusor muscle, the muscle responsible for bladder contraction. By relaxing this muscle, Vibegron increases the bladder's capacity to hold urine, reducing the frequency of urination and the urge to urinate.  This helps control the symptoms of overactive bladder.

### Precautions
Vibegron is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Vibegron or any of its components.

Use caution when prescribing Vibegron to patients:

* With bladder obstruction (because it can worsen urinary retention)
* Taking concomitant muscarinic antagonists (as this combination may increase the risk of side effects)

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of Vibegron during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been established.  The decision to use Vibegron during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, carefully weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Vibegron with other medications?**
A: It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking before starting Vibegron. Some medications may interact with Vibegron.  Your doctor can assess potential drug interactions and ensure your safety.  Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored before initiating and during therapy with Vibegron.


**Q: How should I store Vibegron?**
A: Store Vibegron as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.


**Q: How long will it take before I see results?**
A: The time it takes to experience relief from OAB symptoms can vary.  It's important to be patient and follow your doctor's instructions.  Contact your doctor if you don't notice any improvement after a reasonable period.


**Q:  Can Vibegron cure overactive bladder?**
A: No, Vibegron does not cure OAB; it manages the symptoms.  The underlying cause of OAB may require additional investigation and treatment.
