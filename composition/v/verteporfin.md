# Verteporfin
### Generic Name
Verteporfin

### Usage
Verteporfin is primarily used in the treatment of classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). This condition involves the abnormal growth of blood vessels under the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision.  It's most commonly seen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pathologic myopia (high myopia), or presumed ocular histoplasmosis (a fungal infection affecting the eyes). Verteporfin is a photosensitizing agent; its therapeutic effect relies on activation by a specific wavelength of red light (photodynamic therapy or PDT) which targets and damages the abnormal blood vessels.  

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For subfoveal choroidal neovascularization, the standard intravenous (IV) dose is 6 mg/mÂ².  This treatment is typically repeated every 3 months, as determined by the treating ophthalmologist based on the patient's response.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of verteporfin in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  
* **Hepatic Impairment:** While the manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment, it's known that the drug's half-life increases by 20% with mild impairment.  For moderate-to-severe impairment, dosage adjustments are not established.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary as verteporfin is primarily eliminated through the feces (not the kidneys).


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**
* Injection site reactions (inflammation, pain, discoloration, swelling, bleeding, rash)
* Blurred vision
* Decreased visual acuity
* Photopsia (seeing flashes of light)
* Visual field defects (scotomas or blind spots)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**
* Severe vision loss (can involve subretinal/retinal or vitreous hemorrhage)
* Retinal detachment
* Retinal ischemia (lack of blood flow to the retina)
* Retinal pigment epithelium tear
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Cardiovascular events (e.g., atrial fibrillation, chest pain)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Verteporfin is a photosensitizing drug.  It selectively accumulates in abnormal blood vessels within the eye.  When activated by a specific wavelength of red light (689 nm) during photodynamic therapy (PDT), it produces reactive oxygen species (like singlet oxygen). These reactive oxygen species damage the endothelium (the inner lining) of the abnormal blood vessels, leading to their closure and reducing leakage. This helps to stabilize the condition and prevent further vision loss.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**
* Known hypersensitivity to verteporfin or any components of the formulation
* Porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme synthesis)

**Warnings:**
* Verteporfin must be used in conjunction with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a specific wavelength of red light.  Improper administration can lead to serious complications.
* Increased risk of extravasation (leakage from the vein during injection) and infusion reactions.  Careful monitoring during IV administration is essential.
* Increased photosensitivity: Patients should avoid direct sunlight and UV exposure for several days following treatment to minimize the risk of skin reactions.  Patients should be counseled on appropriate sun protection measures.
* Interactions with other drugs: Concomitant use with certain medications, including calcium channel blockers, diuretics, thiazides, griseofulvin, phenothiazines, polymyxin B, radiation therapy, sulfonamides, sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, and tetracyclines, may increase the risk of photosensitivity reactions or alter verteporfin uptake. Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Verteporfin is categorized as pregnancy category C.  It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding may need to be discontinued or treatment postponed based on individual circumstances.  Consult your doctor about the potential risks and benefits.

### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Verteporfin treatment?** A:  The improvement in vision varies significantly among patients, and it can take several weeks or months to observe noticeable benefits.  Regular follow-up appointments are crucial to assess treatment response.

* **Q: How long does the photosensitivity last after treatment?** A:  The increased photosensitivity typically lasts for a few days after treatment with verteporfin. It's vital to strictly adhere to sun protection measures during this period.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving Verteporfin treatment?** A:  Vision may be temporarily affected after treatment, so driving may be unsafe immediately following the procedure.  Follow your doctor's advice regarding driving restrictions.

* **Q: How is Verteporfin stored?** A:  Store verteporfin according to the directions provided by your physician or pharmacist. Generally, it requires specific storage conditions to maintain its efficacy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Verteporfin is typically administered as a course of treatment rather than daily dosing.  If you have questions or concerns about your treatment schedule, consult your ophthalmologist.
