# Voclosporin
### Generic Name
Voclosporin

### Usage
Voclosporin is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant primarily used in adult patients with active lupus nephritis.  It's used in combination with other immunosuppressant medications, typically corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil, to manage the disease and prevent further kidney damage.  Currently, it's not approved for use in children or for any conditions other than lupus nephritis.

### Dosage
**Adult Lupus Nephritis:** The usual starting dose is 23.7 mg twice daily (BID), taken orally, in combination with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Initiating treatment is generally not recommended for individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 45 mL/minute/1.73 m² unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks, or for those with blood pressure >165/105 mmHg or experiencing a hypertensive emergency.  Treatment should be reconsidered after 24 weeks if no therapeutic benefit is observed.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B): 15.8 mg BID. Severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C): Not recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Prior to treatment initiation, patients with eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m² should generally not begin treatment unless benefits outweigh the risks.  For those with CrCl >30 mL/min, no initial dosage adjustment is needed, whereas patients with CrCl <30 mL/min should start with 15.8 mg BID.  During treatment, eGFR reductions require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments or discontinuation, depending on the severity and persistence of the decrease.  Consult the detailed prescribing information for precise guidelines on dose reduction and re-initiation based on eGFR changes.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of voclosporin in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10%):

* Headache
* Hypertension
* Diarrhea
* Urinary tract infection
* Anemia
* Decreased mean glomerular filtration rate
* Cough

Less common side effects (1-10%):

* Fatigue
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth)
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Dyspepsia
* Gingivitis
* Oral mucosa ulcer
* Upper abdominal pain
* Tremor
* Acute kidney injury
* Renal insufficiency


Serious but less common side effects (frequency not defined):  These include various infections (including serious and opportunistic infections), malignancies (lymphoma, skin cancer, etc.),  neurotoxicity, pure red cell aplasia (PRCA),  prolonged QT interval, hyperkalemia,  and nephrotoxicity.

**Important:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Voclosporin is a calcineurin inhibitor.  It works by suppressing the activity of calcineurin, an enzyme crucial for the activation of T-cells, a type of white blood cell involved in immune responses. By inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin reduces T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, thus dampening the immune system's response and helping to control the inflammation associated with lupus nephritis.  This helps to protect the kidneys from further damage.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Voclosporin is contraindicated in patients with serious or severe hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and in those concurrently using CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin).
* **Increased Risk:**  Voclosporin increases the risk of malignancies, serious infections (potentially fatal), nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, QT interval prolongation, and hyperkalemia.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice.  Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.  It's not recommended for use with cyclophosphamide.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Voclosporin may cause adverse effects in pregnant patients and its use should be avoided during pregnancy. Due to the potential for adverse effects in the infant, breastfeeding is not recommended during therapy and for 7 days after the last dose.
* **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of eGFR, blood pressure, serum potassium levels, and for signs of infection or other adverse effects is essential.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or open the voclosporin capsules?** A: No, swallow the capsules whole.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Can I eat grapefruit while taking voclosporin?** A: No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they can interact with the medication.

* **Q: How should I store voclosporin?** A: Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: When should I contact my doctor?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, such as severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, signs of infection, or significant changes in your kidney function.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.  Always consult your healthcare provider for any questions or concerns about voclosporin or your treatment plan.
