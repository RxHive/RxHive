# Vorinostat
### Generic Name
Vorinostat

### Usage
Vorinostat is a medication primarily used to treat cutaneous manifestations (skin symptoms) of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).  This is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer affecting the skin's T-cells.  Vorinostat is specifically indicated for patients with progressive, persistent, or recurrent CTCL after they've received at least two other systemic therapies.  It's important to note that Vorinostat is not a first-line treatment for CTCL.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma):**

The typical adult dosage is 400 mg orally once daily until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  If a patient experiences side effects, the dose may be reduced to 300 mg once daily, or further reduced to 300 mg orally once daily for five consecutive days each week.  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on individual tolerance.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of Vorinostat in pediatric patients have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin levels 1 to 3 times the upper limit of normal, or AST levels greater than the upper limit of normal), the starting dose should be reduced to 300 mg once daily.  For patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times the upper limit of normal), the US manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments due to insufficient data.  Studies have used doses ranging from 100-200 mg once daily in a limited number of patients with severe impairment, but this is not a formally recommended starting dose. Canadian labeling contraindicates Vorinostat use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

* **Renal Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for renal impairment. However, patients with pre-existing renal impairment should be monitored closely as renal excretion does not contribute to Vorinostat elimination.

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI).  Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from proteins, including histones (proteins that help package DNA). By inhibiting HDACs, Vorinostat increases the levels of acetyl groups on histones. This alters the structure of chromatin (DNA and its associated proteins), making it easier for genes to be transcribed and expressed.  This ultimately leads to changes in gene expression that can result in the slowing or stopping of cancer cell growth and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Vorinostat affects HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC6.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Vorinostat is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Vorinostat or any of its components and in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin â‰¥3 times the upper limit of normal) according to Canadian labeling.

* **Interactions:**  Vorinostat can interact with other medications.  Concurrent use with valproate may increase the risk of thrombocytopenia and GI bleeding.  Vorinostat may also enhance the anticoagulant effects of vitamin K antagonists (like warfarin). Close monitoring is essential when taking these medications concurrently.

* **Warnings:** Vorinostat can increase the risk of thromboembolic events (blood clots), dose-related thrombocytopenia and anemia, gastrointestinal disturbances, hyperglycemia, QTc prolongation, and central nervous system effects.  Exercise caution in patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, history of QTc prolongation, or those undergoing surgery.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Vorinostat is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months afterward.  The excretion of Vorinostat in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Vorinostat?**  A:  Vorinostat can cause dizziness and fatigue.  Avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Q: How should I store Vorinostat?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. Generally, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Vorinostat if I feel better?** A: No, do not discontinue Vorinostat without consulting your healthcare provider.  Stopping treatment prematurely can affect the effectiveness of the therapy.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Vorinostat?** A:  Long-term effects are a possibility, and regular monitoring is important.  Discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider.
