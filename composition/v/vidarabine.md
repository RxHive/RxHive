# Vidarabine
### Generic Name
Vidarabine

### Usage
Vidarabine is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat infections caused by herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and varicella-zoster viruses (VZV).  Its main applications are in treating:

* **Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE):**  A severe and potentially life-threatening infection of the brain. Vidarabine is administered intravenously in this case.
* **Herpetic keratitis:**  This is an infection of the cornea (the clear front part of the eye) caused by the herpes simplex virus.  Vidarabine is applied topically as an ophthalmic ointment.  This includes both acute and recurrent forms of keratitis.
* **Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis:** This involves both the cornea and conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye).  Treatment is via topical application.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE):** Intravenous infusion of 15 mg/kg/day, administered over 12-24 hours.  The maximum dose per infusion is 20 mg/kg.
* **Herpetic keratitis/keratoconjunctivitis:** Topical ophthalmic ointment (3%).  Typically, a one-inch ribbon is applied to the affected eye(s) five times daily. After the corneal epithelium (the outer layer of the cornea) has healed, the frequency is reduced to twice or three times daily for an additional seven days.  If there's no improvement after 21 days of treatment, a reevaluation is necessary.


**Children:**

* Safety and effectiveness in children under 2 years of age have not been established.
* **Herpetic keratitis/keratoconjunctivitis (children â‰¥ 2 years):**  Topical ophthalmic ointment (3%) is applied in the same manner as in adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor for guidance in these cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Headache
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
*  Photophobia (increased sensitivity to light)
* Lacrimation (excessive tearing)
* Eye irritation and pain (with topical application)


Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Neurological effects such as confusion, ataxia (loss of coordination), psychosis, and hallucinations.
* Superficial punctate keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Vidarabine is a nucleoside analog antiviral drug.  It works by being converted inside cells infected with HSV or VZV into vidarabine triphosphate.  This molecule interferes with the virus's ability to replicate its DNA by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase and acting as a chain terminator in DNA synthesis. This effectively stops the virus from multiplying and spreading.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Vidarabine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to vidarabine or any components of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Vidarabine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, balancing potential benefits against potential risks to the fetus. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is warranted when using vidarabine during breastfeeding.
* **Visual Effects:** Temporary visual haze can occur, especially with topical administration.  Use of sunglasses in bright light is often recommended.
* **Other Medications:**  Consult your healthcare provider about potential interactions with other medications you may be taking.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  While specific dosage adjustments aren't provided, patients with impaired liver or kidney function should be carefully monitored during treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Vidarabine?** A:  Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from direct light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Vidarabine when I feel better?** A: No, complete the prescribed course of treatment even if you feel better to prevent recurrence of infection and to ensure the complete eradication of the virus.  Stopping prematurely can lead to resistance.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is Vidarabine safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use is generally not recommended unless specifically advised by your healthcare provider. Prolonged use can potentially increase the risk of side effects.
* **Q: Are there alternatives to Vidarabine?** A: Yes, several other antiviral medications are available for treating HSV and VZV infections. Your healthcare provider can help determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific situation.
