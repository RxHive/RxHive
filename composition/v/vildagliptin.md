# Vildagliptin
### Generic Name
Vildagliptin

### Usage
Vildagliptin is used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's not used for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  The medication works best when used alongside diet and exercise.  Vildagliptin can be used as a monotherapy (on its own) or in combination with other antidiabetic medications.  Its primary use is to help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

### Dosage

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Adults):**

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose is 50 mg once daily (OD) or twice daily (BID), up to a maximum of 100 mg daily.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Vildagliptin is generally not recommended for people with pre-existing liver impairment (ALT or AST levels >2.5 times the upper limit of normal).  Treatment should be stopped if ALT or AST levels rise above 3 times the upper limit of normal during treatment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on kidney function (eGFR or creatinine clearance).  Consult your healthcare provider for specific guidance based on your eGFR or creatinine clearance.
* **Children:** The safety and efficacy of vildagliptin in children have not been established.

**Important Note:**  Concurrent use with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist is generally avoided due to a lack of proven added benefit in lowering blood sugar.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Dizziness


**Less Common (<1%, Post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Abnormal liver function tests
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Bullous pemphigoid (a type of blistering skin disease)
* Constipation
* Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin reaction)
* Headache
* Reversible hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Swelling in the extremities (peripheral edema)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Hives (urticaria)

**Serious Note:**  If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the less common ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretin hormones. Incretin hormones (like GLP-1 and GIP) help the body regulate blood sugar by increasing insulin release from the pancreas when glucose levels are high and decreasing glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar). By inhibiting DPP-4, vildagliptin increases the levels of active incretin hormones, leading to improved blood sugar control.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Vildagliptin should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity to vildagliptin or any of its ingredients.
* **Increased Risk:** Vildagliptin may increase the risk of bullous pemphigoid, exfoliative skin disorders, pancreatitis, and arthralgia.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis, or moderate to severe kidney problems, including those undergoing hemodialysis.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of vildagliptin during pregnancy is not established.  Other diabetes medications are generally preferred during pregnancy.  It is unclear whether vildagliptin is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Vildagliptin can interact with other medications, including ACE inhibitors, other blood sugar-lowering drugs, and others.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Vildagliptin with food?** A: Vildagliptin may be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store Vildagliptin?** A: Store Vildagliptin tablets as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking Vildagliptin suddenly?** A:  Do not stop taking Vildagliptin without consulting your healthcare provider.  Stopping abruptly could lead to adverse effects on blood sugar control.  Your doctor will advise on the proper way to discontinue the medication.
* **Q:  Is Vildagliptin suitable for everyone with type 2 diabetes?** A: No, it is not.  Its use depends on factors including overall health, kidney function, liver function, and other medications being taken. Your doctor will help you determine if it's appropriate for you.
