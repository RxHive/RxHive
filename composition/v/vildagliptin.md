# Vildagliptin

**Generic Name:** Vildagliptin

**Usage:**

Vildagliptin is used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's particularly useful for people who don't achieve adequate blood sugar control with diet and exercise alone, or who are already taking metformin but need additional help.  It's sometimes used in combination with other diabetes medications.  It is *not* used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Upper respiratory tract infection (common cold symptoms)
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Joint pain
* Back pain

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, symptoms include severe stomach pain)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Liver problems (rare but serious, monitor liver function tests)
* Swelling in your arms or legs (edema)
* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), particularly if combined with other diabetes medications like insulin or sulfonylureas


**How it Works:**

Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  It works by increasing the levels of incretins in the body. Incretins are hormones that help your pancreas release more insulin when your blood sugar is high and reduce the amount of glucose your liver produces.  This helps to lower blood sugar levels without causing significant drops in blood sugar like some other diabetes medications.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take vildagliptin with other medications?**  Vildagliptin can be taken with other diabetes medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin. However, it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor to manage potential side effects, especially hypoglycemia.
* **How is vildagliptin taken?** It's typically taken orally, once or twice a day, as directed by your doctor.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **What are the long-term effects of vildagliptin?**  Long-term studies are ongoing, but currently available data suggest generally acceptable long-term safety.  Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels and liver function are essential.
* **Can vildagliptin cause weight gain?**  While weight gain is not a common side effect, it's possible.  Diet and exercise are important to manage weight alongside diabetes treatment.
* **Is vildagliptin safe for people with kidney problems?** The dosage may need to be adjusted for individuals with kidney problems. Your doctor will assess your kidney function before prescribing vildagliptin and may adjust the dosage accordingly.
* **Should I stop taking vildagliptin suddenly?** No, you should not stop taking vildagliptin suddenly.  Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.
