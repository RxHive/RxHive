# Venetoclax
### Generic Name
Venetoclax

### Usage

Venetoclax is a targeted cancer medication primarily used to treat specific types of blood cancers.  Its main application is in adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).  It's also approved for use in adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are 75 years or older, or who have health problems that prevent them from receiving intensive chemotherapy. In these AML cases, it's used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs like azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine.  While not officially approved for these uses, Venetoclax is sometimes used off-label in treating relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, often in combination with other therapies.  The use in these off-label situations should be discussed with an oncologist.

### Dosage

Venetoclax dosage varies significantly depending on the specific cancer being treated and whether it's used alone or with other drugs.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist precisely.  There is no single "standard" dose.

**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):**  The starting dose is usually 100mg daily, gradually increasing over several days to a final maintenance dose (which varies based on the accompanying chemotherapy medication).  The exact ramp-up schedule and final dose will be determined by your healthcare provider.

**Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL):**  This involves a 5-week ramp-up period, starting with a very low dose and gradually increasing to a maintenance dose of 400 mg daily.  This slow increase helps minimize the risk of a serious side effect called tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). When used in combination with other medications like obinutuzumab or rituximab, the starting and maintenance doses and schedules differ again.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Venetoclax's safety and effectiveness haven't been established in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function.  Individuals with severe liver impairment might require a 50% dose reduction. While no specific dosage adjustments are given for kidney impairment, close monitoring and possibly altered preventative measures are necessary for individuals with reduced renal function.  Your doctor will adjust your dosage as needed based on your specific condition and response to treatment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

*   Fatigue
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Constipation
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Abdominal pain
*   Skin rash
*   Decreased blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
*   Edema (swelling)
*   Muscle pain
*   Cough
*   Shortness of breath

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS):  This is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur when cancer cells break down rapidly, releasing harmful substances into the bloodstream.
*   Serious infections: Due to the impact on the immune system.
*   Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells).


If you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor.  BCL-2 is a protein that helps cancer cells survive.  Venetoclax works by blocking BCL-2, thereby allowing the body's natural defense mechanisms to eliminate the cancer cells through programmed cell death (apoptosis).

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  Venetoclax is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to it or any of its components, and in certain cases with concurrent strong CYP3A inhibitors.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Venetoclax interacts with several other medications, particularly those affecting the liver enzymes CYP3A and P-glycoprotein.  It is essential to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking.
*   **Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):**  A significant risk, especially at the beginning of treatment, particularly in patients with high tumor burden.  Prophylactic measures (like hydration and medication to prevent uric acid buildup) are often used to mitigate this risk.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Venetoclax can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for one week following the final dose.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments might be needed for individuals with reduced liver or kidney function.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I take Venetoclax?** A:  Venetoclax is typically taken orally, once daily, with food and water.  Never crush, chew, or break the tablets. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully regarding the specific dosage schedule.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose and it's within 8 hours of your usual time, take it immediately.  If it's more than 8 hours, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule.

*   **Q: How is Venetoclax stored?** A: Store Venetoclax as directed by your pharmacist or doctor.

*   **Q:  What are the signs of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)?** A:  Signs of TLS can include muscle weakness, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, changes in urine output, and altered heart rhythm. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect TLS.

*   **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Venetoclax?** A: No. Grapefruit and similar citrus fruits can interact with Venetoclax, potentially increasing its levels in the blood. Avoid them entirely during treatment.
