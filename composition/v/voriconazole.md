# Voriconazole

**Generic Name:** Voriconazole

**Usage:** Voriconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat serious fungal infections, including:

* **Invasive aspergillosis:** A serious infection caused by *Aspergillus* fungi.
* **Candidemia:**  A bloodstream infection caused by *Candida* yeast.
* **Esophageal candidiasis:** A *Candida* infection of the esophagus.
* **Other invasive candidiasis:**  *Candida* infections affecting other organs.
* **Scedosporiosis:**  Infection caused by *Scedosporium* and *Lomentospora* fungi.
* **Fungal keratitis:**  A fungal infection of the cornea (the clear front part of the eye).  (Note: Topical formulations might be used for this, not always oral voriconazole).


Voriconazole may be used to treat infections in various parts of the body, including the lungs, brain, and bloodstream.  The specific usage will depend on the type and severity of the fungal infection.  It is typically administered intravenously (IV) for severe infections, and then switched to an oral form once the patient is stable.

**Side Effects:**  Voriconazole can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, fever, abdominal pain.
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Visual disturbances (blurred vision, photophobia), liver problems (hepatotoxicity – indicated by abnormal liver function tests),  heart problems (prolongation of the QT interval on ECG), kidney problems, skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis – rare but potentially life-threatening), hallucinations, confusion, seizures.

It's crucial to report any unusual side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By disrupting ergosterol production, voriconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and preventing the fungus from growing and spreading.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is voriconazole safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Voriconazole should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks to the mother and the fetus/infant. The prescribing physician will carefully consider this.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking voriconazole?** A:  Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage, so it's best to avoid alcohol while taking voriconazole.
* **Q: How long do I need to take voriconazole?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the type and severity of the infection and the patient's response to treatment. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if unsure.
* **Q: Can I take other medications with voriconazole?** A: Voriconazole can interact with many other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking before starting voriconazole.  Your doctor may need to adjust the dosage of other medications or monitor you closely for potential interactions.
* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction to voriconazole?** A: Signs of an allergic reaction may include hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
