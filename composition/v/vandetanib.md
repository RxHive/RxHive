# Vandetanib
### Generic Name
Vandetanib

### Usage
Vandetanib is primarily used to treat medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) that has spread (metastasized) or cannot be surgically removed (unresectable).  It's specifically indicated for patients with symptomatic or progressive disease.  The drug is considered only after careful evaluation of the risks versus benefits, particularly for patients with indolent, asymptomatic, or slowly progressing MTC.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical oral dose is 300 mg once daily. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on factors like renal impairment and the development of adverse events.

* **Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥50 mL/min, no dose adjustment is needed. If CrCl is <50 mL/min, the initial dose should be reduced to 200 mg once daily, with close monitoring of the QT interval.  There are no specific dosage adjustments provided for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis.

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Vandetanib is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C).  Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) may not require dose adjustment, but careful monitoring is crucial.

* **Dosage Reduction for Adverse Reactions:** Dose reduction is based on the severity and type of side effects.  For example, a reduction from 300 mg to 200 mg, then possibly to 100 mg, may be necessary.  In some cases, the medication may need to be temporarily withheld until symptoms improve.  Severe adverse effects may necessitate permanent discontinuation.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of vandetanib in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

The following is a list of potential side effects, categorized by frequency:

**Common (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Acne
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT)
* Decreased appetite


**Less Common (1-10%):**

* Depression
* Cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain)
* Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
* Hypocalcemia (low calcium levels)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Changes in nails


**Rare (<1% or Post-marketing):**

* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm)
* Torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Heart failure
* Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) (a neurological disorder)
* Arterial aneurysms or dissections
* Intestinal perforation
* Pancreatitis


It's crucial to note that this isn't an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Vandetanib is a multi-kinase inhibitor. This means it blocks the activity of multiple protein kinases, including those involved in cell growth and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). Specifically, it targets kinases such as EGFR, VEGF, RET, and others. By inhibiting these kinases, vandetanib interferes with the signaling pathways that promote the growth and spread of cancer cells in MTC.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Vandetanib should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug, congenital long QT syndrome, a persistently corrected QT interval (QTcF) ≥500 msec, uncorrected electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), or uncontrolled hypertension.
* **QT Prolongation:** Vandetanib can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of serious heart rhythm problems like torsades de pointes and sudden death.  Electrolyte levels and ECG monitoring are essential.  Concomitant use with other QT-prolonging drugs should be avoided.
* **Hemorrhage:**  An increased risk of bleeding exists. Patients with a history of bleeding disorders should be carefully monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Vandetanib is harmful to a developing fetus and should be avoided during pregnancy. Effective contraception is necessary for women of childbearing potential during and for at least 4 months after treatment. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during and for 4 months after treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Vandetanib can interact with various medications.  It's crucial to inform the healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  CYP3A4 inducers (like rifampicin) and St. John's wort should be avoided due to their potential to decrease vandetanib levels.
* **Other Precautions:** Monitor for signs of other serious side effects, such as heart failure, RPLS, and pulmonary or skin toxicities.  Sun exposure should be limited.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Vandetanib with food?** A: Vandetanib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a missed dose if it is within 12 hours of the next scheduled dose.
