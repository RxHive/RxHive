# Vilanterol + Fluticasone Furoate + Glycopyrronium
### Generic Name
Vilanterol + Fluticasone Furoate + Glycopyrronium (Triple Combination Inhaler)


**Note:**  There isn't a single generic name for this triple combination inhaler as it's a combination of three separate medications.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. This information refers to the generic components and their combined action.  Always refer to your prescription and the accompanying patient information leaflet for the specific brand name and instructions for your medication.

### Usage

This triple combination inhaler is used to prevent and treat symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's also used to prevent symptoms in people with asthma. This medication works by combining three different mechanisms to improve lung function and reduce symptoms.


The primary use is long-term maintenance treatment of COPD and asthma to reduce symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. The combination therapy aims to provide a broader and more effective approach than using each medication individually. It is typically prescribed for individuals whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by a single inhaler or a combination of two inhalers.  The secondary uses could include improving lung function and quality of life in patients with these conditions.



### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary widely depending on the specific brand, the individual's condition, and the physician's judgment.  **This information is not a substitute for instructions from your doctor or pharmacist.**  The medication usually comes in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) or a dry powder inhaler (DPI).

* **Adults:** The usual dose is one inhalation twice daily.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your specific needs and response to treatment.
* **Children:** This medication is generally not prescribed for children.  Specific guidance for pediatric use is needed from a pulmonologist or other qualified pediatric healthcare provider if considering this medication for a child.
* **Oral/IV:** This medication is administered via inhalation only and is not available in oral or intravenous forms.


**Important:**  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional regarding proper inhaler technique.  Improper use can significantly reduce the effectiveness of the medication.



### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Throat irritation
* Hoarseness
* Cough
* Oral thrush (fungal infection in the mouth)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Pneumonia (increased risk in some COPD patients)

Less common but potentially serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Increased risk of bone fractures (with long-term use)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of wheezing after inhalation - needs immediate attention)
* Increased risk of pneumonia

If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

This combination inhaler contains three active ingredients that work together to manage respiratory symptoms:

* **Vilanterol:** A long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA). It relaxes the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe.
* **Fluticasone Furoate:** A corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation in the airways, helping to prevent airway narrowing and reducing mucus production.
* **Glycopyrronium:** A long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). It also relaxes the muscles around the airways, further improving breathing.

By combining these three mechanisms, the inhaler provides a more comprehensive approach to managing COPD and asthma symptoms than medications using only one or two of these mechanisms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication.  Careful monitoring by a healthcare professional is important.
* **Other Precautions:**  This medication does not provide immediate relief from acute asthma attacks or COPD exacerbations.  Use a rescue inhaler (usually a short-acting beta2-agonist) as instructed by your doctor for acute symptom relief.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  A: No.  Stopping abruptly can worsen your condition. Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding discontinuation.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the inhaler as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I use this medication if I have a cold?** A: Consult your doctor. While generally safe to continue, severe colds may impact your breathing and require adjustment in dosage or treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I use this inhaler with other inhalers?**  A: You may be prescribed other inhalers in conjunction with this one. Your doctor will provide specific instructions on how to use them correctly and in the right order.  Always ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about your medication regimen.
