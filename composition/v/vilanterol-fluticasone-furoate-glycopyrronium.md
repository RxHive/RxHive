# Vilanterol + Fluticasone Furoate + Glycopyrronium

**Generic Name:** Vilanterol/Fluticasone furoate/Glycopyrronium

**Usage:**

This triple combination inhaler is used to prevent and treat airflow blockage in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's also used to prevent airflow blockage in people with asthma.  It's a maintenance medication, meaning it's taken regularly to prevent symptoms, not to treat acute attacks.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and frequency.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Headache:**  A fairly frequent side effect.
* **Throat irritation:**  Can be caused by the inhaler itself.
* **Cough:**  May be exacerbated initially, but should improve with continued use.
* **Upper respiratory tract infections:** Increased susceptibility to common colds.
* **Oral thrush (candidiasis):**  A fungal infection in the mouth, more likely with higher doses or poor rinsing technique.
* **Pneumonia:** There's an increased risk, especially in older adults with COPD.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Increased risk of bone fractures:**  Inhaled corticosteroids can impact bone density over long periods.
* **Glaucoma and cataracts:** Increased risk, especially with prolonged use.
* **Increased blood sugar:**  Monitor blood glucose levels if you have diabetes.
* **Muscle weakness:**  A potential side effect of corticosteroids.


**How it Works:**

This combination inhaler contains three different medications that work in different ways to improve lung function:

* **Vilanterol:** A long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA). It relaxes the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe.
* **Fluticasone furoate:** A corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation in the airways, preventing swelling and mucus production.
* **Glycopyrronium:** A long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). It also relaxes the muscles around the airways, providing additional bronchodilation.


By combining these three medications, the inhaler provides a more comprehensive approach to managing COPD and asthma symptoms than using each medication individually.  It offers both bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use this inhaler for an acute asthma attack?**  A: No. This is a maintenance medication for preventing symptoms, not treating sudden attacks.  You will need a rescue inhaler (like albuterol) for acute episodes.
* **Q: How should I use the inhaler?**  A: Follow your doctor's and pharmacist's instructions carefully.  Proper technique is crucial for effective delivery of the medication.  Rinse your mouth after each use to prevent oral thrush.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  A: No.  Stopping abruptly can worsen your symptoms.  Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.
* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?**  A: Yes, there can be.  Inform your doctor and pharmacist about all the medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**  A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
