# Vestronidase Alfa
### Generic Name
Vestronidase Alfa

### Usage

Vestronidase alfa is a prescription medicine used to treat mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), also known as Sly syndrome.  MPS VII is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder where the body lacks or has very little of the enzyme beta-glucuronidase. This enzyme's deficiency leads to the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in various tissues and organs, causing a range of symptoms. Vestronidase alfa aims to replace this missing enzyme, helping to break down the accumulated GAGs and alleviate some of the symptoms associated with MPS VII.  It's important to note that the impact of vestronidase alfa on central nervous system manifestations of MPS VII has not yet been fully determined.


### Dosage

**Mucopolysaccharidosis VII:**

* **Intravenous (IV) Infusion:** The standard dose for both adults and children is 4 mg/kg of body weight.  This dose is administered once every two weeks.
* **Infusion Rate:** The infusion should be given over approximately four hours.  It's recommended to administer 2.5% of the total dose in the first hour, then gradually increase the rate over the remaining three hours, as tolerated by the patient.
* **Premedication:**  Premedication with a non-sedating antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic (fever reducer), is typically recommended 30-60 minutes before starting the IV infusion. This helps to minimize potential allergic reactions.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, adjustments based on these factors are generally considered unlikely to be necessary.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients) may include:

* Infusion site extravasation (leakage from the vein)
* Diarrhea
* Rash
* Anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Infusion-site swelling
* Peripheral swelling
* Pruritus (itching)


Serious, but less common side effects, such as anaphylaxis, warrant immediate medical attention.  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works

Vestronidase alfa is a recombinant form of human beta-glucuronidase (rhGUS).  It functions as a replacement for the missing or deficient enzyme in individuals with MPS VII. The enzyme possesses mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues, which allow it to bind to receptors on the surface of cells. This binding facilitates the enzyme's uptake into the cells' lysosomes (cellular compartments responsible for waste breakdown). Once inside the lysosomes, vestronidase alfa breaks down the accumulated GAGs, reducing their levels in the affected tissues and organs. This process helps to alleviate the symptoms of MPS VII.

### Precautions

* **Anaphylaxis:** There is a boxed warning about the risk of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction). This can occur even with the first dose, so close monitoring during and after infusion is crucial.  Emergency medical support should be readily available during administration.
* **Infusion Site Reactions:** Closely monitor the infusion site for extravasation and swelling.
* **Other Precautions:**  Information on the use of vestronidase alfa during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited.  Consult your doctor to weigh the potential risks and benefits.
