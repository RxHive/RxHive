# Eculizumab
### Generic Name
Eculizumab

### Usage
Eculizumab is a medication used to treat several serious conditions involving the body's complement system, a part of the immune system that helps fight off infections.  Its primary uses are:

* **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH):**  PNH is a rare blood disorder causing red blood cell destruction (hemolysis). Eculizumab helps reduce this hemolysis, alleviating symptoms like fatigue and anemia.

* **Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS):** aHUS is a life-threatening condition characterized by blood clots in small blood vessels, leading to kidney damage and other organ problems. Eculizumab inhibits the complement system's uncontrolled activation, preventing further blood clot formation.

* **Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG):** In adult patients who test positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies, eculizumab offers treatment for this neuromuscular disorder marked by muscle weakness and fatigue.

* **Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD):** Eculizumab is used in adult patients who test positive for anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies to manage this autoimmune disorder affecting the optic nerves and spinal cord.  This helps reduce attacks and improve neurological function.

It's crucial to understand that Eculizumab is *not* used to treat Shiga toxin *Escherichia coli*-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS).


### Dosage
Eculizumab is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's weight (especially in children), and whether other treatments (like plasmapheresis) are being used concurrently.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **PNH:**  Induction: 600 mg weekly for 4 doses; Maintenance: 900 mg at week 5, then 900 mg every 2 weeks.
* **aHUS, gMG, NMOSD:** Induction: 900 mg weekly for 4 doses; Maintenance: 1200 mg at week 5, then 1200 mg every 2 weeks.
* **With plasmapheresis/exchange:** Supplemental doses are given within 60 minutes of the procedure, the amount depending on the most recent Eculizumab dose.
* **With fresh frozen plasma:**  Supplemental doses may be administered 60 minutes prior to the infusion.


**Children (aHUS only):**  Dosage is weight-based and is much more complex, requiring careful calculation by a healthcare professional.  It generally follows a similar induction and maintenance schedule as adults, but the amounts are adjusted to the childâ€™s weight.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Insomnia

* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Gastroenteritis
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Urinary tract infection

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Meningococcal infections (life-threatening)
* Other serious infections
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Severe hemolysis (in PNH patients if treatment is stopped)

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets complement protein C5.  The complement system is part of the immune system, and uncontrolled activation of this system can damage tissues and organs.  By binding to C5, Eculizumab prevents its breakdown into C5a and C5b, halting the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC).  This ultimately reduces the damage caused by the complement system in conditions like aHUS and PNH, and can help mitigate symptoms in gMG and NMOSD.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Eculizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, unresolved serious *Neisseria meningitidis* infection, and those unvaccinated against *N. meningitidis* (unless the risk of treatment delay outweighs the infection risk).
* **Meningococcal Vaccination:**  Patients must receive the meningococcal vaccine at least two weeks before starting Eculizumab.  Prophylactic antibiotics may be necessary.  This is critical because Eculizumab increases the risk of serious meningococcal infections.
* **Infections:** Eculizumab increases the risk of various infections.  Any infection should be reported to your doctor immediately.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Eculizumab is a Category C pregnancy drug. The effects on pregnancy and breastfeeding are not fully understood; the decision to use it during these times should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.
* **Interactions:**  Eculizumab can interact with other medications.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
