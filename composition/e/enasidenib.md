# Enasidenib
### Generic Name
Enasidenib

### Usage
Enasidenib is a medication used to treat adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  This is a type of blood cancer. Importantly, it's only used in patients whose AML is shown to have a specific mutation in the IDH2 gene.  This mutation must be confirmed by an FDA-approved test before treatment begins.  Enasidenib works by targeting and inhibiting this mutated IDH2 enzyme.


### Dosage
The standard adult dose of Enasidenib is 100 mg taken orally once daily.  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  Doctors typically recommend a minimum treatment duration of 6 months for patients who tolerate the drug and show no disease progression, allowing time for a potential clinical response.

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on certain factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  While the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for mild to severe hepatic (liver) impairment, monitoring is crucial.  If bilirubin levels rise above three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for two weeks without elevated transaminases, the dose might be reduced to 50 mg daily.  The dose can be increased back to 100 mg once bilirubin levels fall below twice the ULN.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¥30 mL/min.  For patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, no dosage adjustments are explicitly outlined in the manufacturer's labeling.  Close monitoring remains essential.

* **Toxicity Management:**  Dose adjustments or interruptions may be necessary based on the severity of side effects. For example, for differentiation syndrome, a serious side effect (explained below), corticosteroids may be needed, and Enasidenib may be temporarily stopped.  Grade 3 or higher toxicities, including tumor lysis syndrome, may also necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation.  Specific guidance should be obtained from a healthcare professional.


**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Enasidenib in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Decreased serum calcium and potassium levels
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Decreased appetite
* Vomiting
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Abnormal phosphorus levels
* Differentiation syndrome (a serious condition, see below)
* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Increased serum bilirubin levels

Less common but serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Tumor lysis syndrome (a serious condition that can result from rapid tumor breakdown)
* Acute respiratory distress
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Enasidenib is a targeted therapy that works by inhibiting the mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) enzyme.  AML cells with a mutated IDH2 gene produce excessive amounts of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a metabolite that disrupts normal cell function and contributes to cancer development. By blocking the mutated IDH2 enzyme, Enasidenib reduces 2-HG levels, restoring normal cell differentiation and reducing the number of leukemia cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Enasidenib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** Enasidenib can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their serum concentrations. For instance, it may increase levels of elagolix, estradiol, norethindrone, digoxin, and rosuvastatin.  Healthcare professionals should carefully review a patient's medication list to assess potential interactions.

* **Differentiation Syndrome:** This is a serious side effect requiring close monitoring.  Symptoms can include fever, shortness of breath, lung problems, edema, and other organ dysfunction.  Prompt corticosteroid treatment is usually necessary.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Enasidenib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least two months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least one month after the final dose.

* **Other Warnings:** Enasidenib can increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances (low calcium, potassium, and phosphorus), leukocytosis, tumor lysis syndrome, and hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin levels).  Regular monitoring of blood counts and chemistries is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Enasidenib with food?** A: Yes, Enasidenib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day, then resume your regular schedule.

* **Q: How should I store Enasidenib?** A: Store Enasidenib as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature.

* **Q:  Are there any specific monitoring requirements?** A: Yes, regular blood tests to monitor blood counts, liver and kidney function, and electrolyte levels are necessary during treatment.  Healthcare professionals will determine the appropriate monitoring frequency.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Enasidenib?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood, and ongoing monitoring is important.  Discuss long-term concerns with your healthcare provider.
