# Eravacycline
### Generic Name
Eravacycline

### Usage

Eravacycline is a type of antibiotic called a fluorocycline, related to the tetracycline family.  Its primary use is in treating complicated intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in adults aged 18 and older.  These are infections within the abdomen that are difficult to treat, often involving multiple organs or requiring surgery.  It's important to note that Eravacycline is *not* used for complicated urinary tract infections.  The medication should only be used when an infection is confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria susceptible to Eravacycline.  This means that testing should ideally be done to ensure the bacteria causing the infection are vulnerable to this specific antibiotic.

### Dosage

**Adults (18 years and older):** For complicated intra-abdominal infections, the usual intravenous (IV) dose is 1 mg/kg every 12 hours for 4 to 14 days.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary depending on certain factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild to moderate liver problems (Child-Pugh class A or B), no dose adjustment is needed. However, those with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C) should receive 1 mg/kg every 12 hours on day 1, followed by 1 mg/kg every 24 hours.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically necessary for patients with kidney problems.
* **Strong CYP3A Inducers (e.g., Rifampin):** If a patient is also taking a strong CYP3A inducer (a type of medication that affects how Eravacycline is processed by the body), the dose should be increased to 1.5 mg/kg every 12 hours for the treatment duration.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of Eravacycline in children have not been established.  Use in children under 8 years old is generally avoided because tetracyclines can cause permanent tooth discoloration, enamel problems, and reversible bone growth inhibition.

**Administration:** Eravacycline is given intravenously.  The diluted solution should be infused over approximately 60 minutes through a dedicated line or via a Y-site. If using the same IV line for multiple medications, flush the line with normal saline before and after Eravacycline administration.  Do not mix Eravacycline with other drugs or add it to solutions containing other medications.  Specific reconstitution and dilution instructions are provided with the medication.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Infusion-site reactions (at the IV injection site)
* Wound dehiscence (wound separation)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Various other side effects like changes in blood counts, liver enzyme elevations,  skin rashes, and neurological symptoms (anxiety, insomnia, dizziness).  


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, consult your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Eravacycline is a bacteriostatic (stops bacterial growth) or bactericidal (kills bacteria) antibiotic.  It works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria.  This interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacteria from producing essential proteins necessary for their survival and replication.  This mechanism is effective against a range of gram-positive and certain gram-negative bacteria.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Eravacycline should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Eravacycline, other tetracyclines, or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Increased Risk of:**  Anaphylaxis, tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia (in children), bone growth inhibition (in children), development of drug-resistant bacteria, liver damage (hepatotoxicity), pancreatitis, photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity), and fungal or bacterial superinfections (new infections caused by other microbes due to disruption of normal bacterial flora).
* **Use with Caution:** In patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tetracyclines can accumulate in developing teeth and bones. Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy may cause reversible bone growth inhibition, and permanent tooth discoloration can occur after in-utero exposure.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers may decrease Eravacycline's effectiveness. It can also interact with anticoagulant drugs (blood thinners), potentially increasing the risk of bleeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Eravacycline?** A: Refer to the product packaging for specific storage instructions. Generally, reconstituted and diluted solutions should be used within 6 hours at room temperature or 24 hours under refrigeration.
* **Q: Can I take Eravacycline with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor for guidance.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes to see improvement will vary depending on the infection and your individual response.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Eravacycline?** A: Consult your doctor for specific dietary advice.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of Eravacycline?** A:  Long-term effects are generally not well-documented but it's essential to follow up with your doctor for monitoring as needed.
