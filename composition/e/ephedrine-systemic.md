# Ephedrine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Ephedrine (Systemic)

### Usage
Ephedrine (systemic) is primarily used to treat two distinct conditions:

1. **Clinically significant hypotension during anesthesia:** This medication helps raise blood pressure when it drops dangerously low during surgical procedures or other anesthetic events.  It acts quickly to restore adequate blood flow and pressure.

2. **Bronchospasm in asthma patients:** While not recommended for routine asthma management, ephedrine can be used to treat bronchospasm (constriction of the airways) in specific situations. It's crucial to note that this is not a first-line treatment for asthma and is usually employed only under specific circumstances and guidance from a healthcare provider.  Modern asthma treatments are generally preferred.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hypotension (anesthesia-induced):** Intravenous (IV) administration is typical. The initial dose is 5-10 mg as a bolus. This may be repeated as needed to maintain blood pressure, but the maximum total dose should not exceed 50 mg.

* **Bronchospasm:** Oral administration is common.  The typical dose is 15-60 mg three times daily (TID).  

* **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (off-label use):** Intramuscular (IM) injection of 0.5 mg/kg at the end of surgery has been explored as a preventative measure, but this is considered off-label use.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Hypotension (anesthesia-induced):** IV administration is employed, given slowly as a push. The dosage is 0.1-0.3 mg/kg per dose, repeated as necessary to maintain blood pressure.  The maximum single dose should not exceed 25 mg and the total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg.

* **Bronchospasm:** Oral administration is used.  Dosing varies based on age:
    * Children 1-5 years: 15 mg TID
    * Children 6-12 years: 30 mg TID
    * Adolescents: 15-60 mg TID

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised when using ephedrine in patients with kidney problems.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Nervousness, restlessness, anxiety, headache, dizziness, insomnia, palpitations, increased heart rate (tachycardia), increased blood pressure (hypertension), nausea, vomiting, tremor.

* **Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Cardiac arrhythmias, angina, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), urinary retention, severe hypertension, severe hypotension.

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine.  It works by releasing norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter, from storage sites in the body. Norepinephrine then binds to alpha and beta adrenergic receptors in various tissues. This causes a range of effects, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and the relaxation of smooth muscles in the airways (bronchodilation).


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Ephedrine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or other sympathomimetics; angle-closure glaucoma; ischemic heart disease; hypertension; thyrotoxicosis (overactive thyroid); prostatic hypertrophy (enlarged prostate); coronary thrombosis; and diabetes mellitus.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ephedrine can interact with many other medications, potentially altering their effects or its own.  Examples include, but are not limited to, MAO inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, other sympathomimetics, and certain anesthetics. Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:** Caution is warranted in the elderly, those with renal impairment, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers.  Use during pregnancy falls under pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Ephedrine is excreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store ephedrine?** A: Store ephedrine as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ephedrine suddenly?** A:  It's essential to follow your doctor's instructions regarding discontinuation.  Stopping suddenly could be harmful.

* **Q: Is ephedrine habit-forming?** A:  Tolerance and tachyphylaxis (diminished response to repeated doses) can develop with prolonged use.


* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one. Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance.
