# Edatrexate
### Generic Name
Edatrexate (EDX) (10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin or 10-EDAM)

### Usage
Edatrexate is an investigational drug, meaning it's still under research and not currently approved for widespread clinical use.  It's a folate antagonist, similar to methotrexate, and was explored as a potential treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and non-small cell lung cancer. However, studies showed limited effectiveness at the tested dosages and schedules, with significant toxicity concerns.  Therefore, it's not currently used to treat any specific medical conditions.

### Dosage
Because Edatrexate is not approved for clinical use, there are no established dosage recommendations for adults or children.  The dosages explored in clinical trials were found to be ineffective and/or caused unacceptable side effects,  hence, specific dosage information is not available.  Any use outside of a strictly controlled clinical trial setting would be inappropriate.

### Side Effects
Since Edatrexate's clinical trials revealed unacceptable toxicity at the tested doses,  information on common side effects is limited to those observed during research.  These side effects varied depending on the dosage and specific trial, but included significant toxicities.  It's important to emphasize that this drug is *not* currently approved for use and should only be administered under the rigorous supervision of a physician within the context of a clinical trial.

### How it Works
Edatrexate functions as a folate antagonist.  It inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme crucial for DNA synthesis. This inhibition leads to an increase in polyglutamates inside cells, impacting several metabolic pathways vital for cell growth and division.  Specifically, it interferes with the synthesis of purine nucleotides and amino acids, ultimately causing tumor cell death.  The hope was that it might overcome resistance to methotrexate seen in some cancers, due to differences in how it's processed by the body.

### Precautions
Due to the lack of approval and the observed toxicity in trials, extensive precautions are necessary.  Edatrexate should *only* be used under strict medical supervision within a controlled clinical trial setting.  There is currently no established information on drug interactions, contraindications, or specific warnings for pregnant women, children, or elderly individuals.  Any use outside of a clinical trial is not recommended.
