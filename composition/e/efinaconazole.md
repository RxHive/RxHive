# Efinaconazole
### Generic Name
Efinaconazole

### Usage
Efinaconazole is a topical antifungal medication primarily used to treat onychomycosis of the toenail(s).  Specifically, it's effective against toenail fungal infections caused by *Trichophyton rubrum* and *Trichophyton mentagrophytes*.  Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail that causes discoloration, thickening, and often, crumbling of the nail.  Efinaconazole is applied directly to the affected nail(s) to combat the infection locally.  It's important to note that efinaconazole is a topical treatment and is not used to treat other types of fungal infections.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children ≥6 years:** For onychomycosis, the recommended dosage is one application of the 10% solution daily to the affected toenail(s) for 48 weeks.  The solution should be applied to the entire nail, including the nail bed, folds, hyponychium (the area under the free edge of the nail), and the undersurface of the nail plate.  Allow the solution to dry completely before putting on socks or shoes.  The medication comes in a solution form with an applicator brush.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Application-site dermatitis (inflammation of the skin)
* Application-site vesicles (small, fluid-filled blisters)
* Application-site pain
* Ingrown nail

While less frequent, more serious side effects are possible.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Efinaconazole is a triazole antifungal agent. It works by inhibiting the fungal enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase. This enzyme is vital for the production of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. By disrupting ergosterol synthesis, efinaconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to fungal cell death and ultimately clearing the infection.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Efinaconazole should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to efinaconazole or any components of the formulation.
* **Interactions:**  While generally well-tolerated, the potential for interactions with other medications is low due to its topical application. However, it’s important to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Efinaconazole is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug. This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there is no adequate data in pregnant women.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. The excretion of efinaconazole in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution is advised when using this medication while breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should avoid pedicures, nail polish, or cosmetic nail products while using efinaconazole.  The affected toenail(s) should be clean and dry before application. Allow at least 10 minutes after showering or bathing before application. Always wash hands thoroughly after applying the medication.
