# Enflurane
### Generic Name
Enflurane

### Usage
Enflurane is an inhaled general anesthetic primarily used for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia during surgical procedures, including cesarean sections.  It's also used for analgesia (pain relief) during vaginal delivery.  Its effectiveness lies in allowing for quick adjustments in the depth of anesthesia with minimal impact on pulse or respiratory rate.

### Dosage
**General Anesthesia (Inhalation):**

* **Induction:** 2-4.5%
* **Maintenance:** 0.5-3% (maximum 3%).  Surgical anesthesia usually occurs within 7-10 minutes.
* **Administration:** Enflurane is always administered with oxygen, or a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide.  If additional muscle relaxation is needed, muscle relaxants are typically added.  Careful ventilation is maintained to keep arterial blood carbon dioxide levels between 35-45 mmHg.

**Analgesia (Obstetrical - Inhalation):**

* **Vaginal Delivery:** 0.25-1%
* **Cesarean Section (supplemental):** 0.5-1% (maximum 1%).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.  

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using Enflurane in patients with these conditions.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, shivering.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Malignant hyperthermia (a life-threatening condition), seizures, respiratory depression, hypoxia (low blood oxygen), hypotension (low blood pressure), arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), elevated white blood cell count, and liver injury (ranging from mild to severe).  Post-marketing surveillance has also revealed reports of cardiac arrest and hepatic necrosis (liver cell death) and failure.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, immediately seek medical attention.


### How it Works
Enflurane is a volatile, halogenated inhaled anesthetic.  While its precise mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed to affect the lipid matrix of nerve cell membranes in the brain.  This alteration may decrease the number of molecules that transition between gel and crystalline states, thus impacting membrane function and leading to anesthesia.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Enflurane is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Enflurane or other halogenated anesthetics, suspected or confirmed genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia, a history of seizures, or porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme synthesis).

**Warnings:**  Enflurane carries an increased risk of malignant hyperthermia, respiratory depression, cardiovascular adverse effects (hypotension, coronary steal phenomenon, and reflex tachycardia), increased intracranial pressure, and hepatic impairment. There is also a risk of perioperative hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood).

**Use with Caution:**  Enflurane should be used cautiously in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, head injuries, respiratory disorders, neuromuscular disorders, renal or hepatic impairment, the elderly, breastfeeding women, and individuals with a medical or drug history suggesting increased susceptibility to cortical stimulation.


**Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with adrenaline (epinephrine) or other sympathomimetics should be avoided.  The effects of atracurium and other neuromuscular blockers are enhanced by Enflurane; concomitant use is generally avoided.  Enflurane can potentiate the hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors, MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensives, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, and CNS depressants.  Concurrent use should be carefully considered and monitored.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I drive after receiving Enflurane anesthesia?**  A: No. Enflurane and other general anesthetics can impair cognitive function. Avoid driving or operating machinery until fully recovered, as advised by your doctor.

**Q: How is Enflurane stored?** A:  Storage guidelines should be followed as indicated by the manufacturer on the product label.

**Q:  Are there long-term effects from Enflurane?** A: While generally well-tolerated, some individuals may experience mild cognitive changes for a few days after administration.  Always consult your healthcare provider regarding any concerns about long-term effects.

**Q:  Is Enflurane safe during pregnancy?** A: Enflurane is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  Its use during pregnancy requires careful consideration of the risks and benefits.  Consult your doctor.

**Q: Can I breastfeed after receiving Enflurane?** A:  Excretion of Enflurane into breast milk is unknown.  Caution is advised, and the decision to breastfeed should be made in consultation with your doctor.
