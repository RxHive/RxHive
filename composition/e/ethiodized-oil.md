# Ethiodized Oil
### Generic Name
Ethiodized Oil

### Usage
Ethiodized oil is a radiopaque contrast medium used in several diagnostic imaging procedures.  Its primary use is in hysterosalpingography (HSG), a procedure to visualize the uterus and fallopian tubes, aiding in the diagnosis of infertility or other uterine/tubal conditions.  It also finds use in lymphography, imaging the lymphatic system to detect lymphatic abnormalities, and in selective hepatic intra-arterial injection for visualizing tumors in known hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the procedure and the patient's individual characteristics.  It's crucial to use the lowest effective dose.

**Hysterosalpingography (HSG):** The total volume injected into the endometrial cavity depends on the uterine cavity size, generally not exceeding 15 mL.  Injection is done in 2 mL increments until tubal patency is observed.  The procedure should be stopped if excessive discomfort occurs.  Follow-up imaging may be done after 24 hours.

**Lymphography:** Dosage depends on the area being imaged.  Examples include 2-4 mL for unilateral upper extremity lymphography, 6-8 mL for unilateral lower extremity lymphography, and smaller doses for other areas (penile, cervical).  Injection should be stopped if pain occurs or if lymphatic blockage is evident to prevent accidental entry into the venous system.  Immediate and follow-up imaging (24-48 hours later) is needed.

**Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Tumor Imaging (Selective Hepatic Intra-arterial Injection):** The dose ranges from 1.5-15 mL, administered slowly under continuous radiologic monitoring.  The dose depends on tumor size and blood flow.  Injection stops if stagnation or reflux is observed.  The maximum total dose is 20 mL.

**Pediatric Dosage (Lymphography):**  For infants, children, and adolescents, the dose is 1-6 mL, depending on the area, with a maximum of 0.25 mL/kg/dose.  Always use the smallest effective dose and monitor closely.


### Side Effects
Ethiodized oil can cause a range of side effects, some common and others more serious and less frequent.  **Always consult a doctor if any adverse effects occur.**

* **Common:** Pain at the injection site.
* **Less Common but Serious:**
    * Cardiovascular events (pulmonary embolism, cerebral artery embolism, thrombophlebitis, etc.)
    * Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, dermatitis)
    * Liver abnormalities (hepatic insufficiency, abnormal liver function tests)
    * Respiratory problems (dyspnea, cough, acute respiratory distress syndrome)
    * Renal insufficiency
    * Thyroid dysfunction (especially with repeated use or pregnancy)
    * Pelvic inflammatory disease (exacerbation)
    * Lymphangitis, lymphedema
    * Granuloma formation


### How it Works
Ethiodized oil is radiopaque, meaning it absorbs X-rays. When injected into the body during the specified procedures, it opacifies the vessels and tissues, making them visible on X-ray images. This allows healthcare providers to visualize the structures of interest, such as the fallopian tubes, lymphatic vessels, or liver tumors.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to iodized oil; hyperthyroidism; recent hemorrhage or trauma; pregnancy (for HSG); acute pelvic inflammatory disease; certain conditions precluding lymphography or HCC imaging (see detailed prescribing information).
* **Warnings:**  There's a risk of thromboembolism (blood clots traveling to the lungs or brain) due to inadvertent intravascular injection.  Slow injection and continuous radiologic monitoring are essential.  Ethiodized oil can interfere with thyroid function, especially during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Patients with pre-existing thyroid conditions, liver disease, or renal impairment require careful monitoring.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications are not well documented in available literature, but consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial when using multiple medications concurrently.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ethiodized oil is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its use carries potential risks to the fetus.  Use is contraindicated in pregnancy for HSG.  It's excreted in breast milk, and the risk to the infant should be carefully weighed against the benefits of treatment for the mother.  Thyroid function testing in the infant may be necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Ethiodized oil to be eliminated from the body?** A: The elimination time is not specified, but it is gradually metabolized and excreted over time.

* **Q: Can I drive after having a procedure using Ethiodized oil?** A: This depends on the procedure and your individual reaction.  Follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: Are there alternatives to Ethiodized oil for these procedures?** A: Yes, other contrast agents are available for HSG and other procedures; discuss these options with your doctor.

* **Q: How is Ethiodized oil stored?** A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones.
