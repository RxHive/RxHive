# Epoprostenol
### Generic Name
Epoprostenol

### Usage
Epoprostenol, also known as prostacyclin (PGIâ‚‚), is primarily used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  This is a serious condition where blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs becomes abnormally high, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Epoprostenol helps to relax and widen the blood vessels in the lungs, reducing this pressure and improving blood flow.  It's also used off-label in acute vasodilator testing to assess the responsiveness of pulmonary vessels to vasodilators in patients with PAH.  This testing helps determine the suitability of certain PAH treatment strategies.

### Dosage
Epoprostenol is administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion.  Dosage is highly individualized and carefully managed by a healthcare professional.

* **Pulmonary Hypertension:**  The initial dose is typically 2 ng/kg/min.  This dose is gradually increased by 1-2 ng/kg/min at intervals of 15 minutes or more, until an optimal dose (usually 25-40 ng/kg/min) is reached.  However, this optimal dose can vary significantly depending on the individual's response.

* **Acute Vasodilator Testing:** The initial dose is 2 ng/kg/min, increasing by 2 ng/kg/min every 10-15 minutes, with a dosing range of 2-10 ng/kg/min.

* **Pediatric Dosage:**  The pediatric dose is similar to the adult dose, but it's crucial that a physician closely monitors the child's response and adjusts the dosage as necessary.

* **Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment.  For older adults, starting at the lower end of the dosing range is recommended.


### Side Effects
Epoprostenol can cause a range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Chills
* Anxiety/Nervousness
* Flushing
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Chest pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Muscle pain
* Fever

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 10% of patients or reported post-marketing):**

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Bleeding
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs)
* Allergic reactions
* Cardiac failure

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Epoprostenol is a prostacyclin analog.  Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring substance that acts as a potent vasodilator (widens blood vessels) and inhibits platelet aggregation (clumping). By mimicking prostacyclin's actions, epoprostenol reduces blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, improves blood flow to the lungs, and reduces the risk of blood clots.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Epoprostenol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to epoprostenol or structurally related compounds, those with chronic heart failure due to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and patients who develop pulmonary edema during dose initiation.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients using epoprostenol have an increased risk of pulmonary thromboembolism, systemic embolism, bleeding, serious bloodstream infections, and pulmonary edema.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using epoprostenol in patients with pulmonary hypertension, a history of bleeding, or those at risk for pulmonary edema.  Close monitoring is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as the drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Epoprostenol can interact with other medications, potentially enhancing their effects (such as antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, vasodilators, and diuretics).  Careful monitoring is necessary when epoprostenol is used concurrently with other medications.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for epoprostenol to work?**  A:  The onset of action varies, but effects are typically seen relatively quickly, though full therapeutic benefit may take longer to achieve.

* **Q: Can I stop taking epoprostenol suddenly?** A: No, abrupt withdrawal can lead to a rebound in pulmonary hypertension symptoms.  The dose should always be reduced gradually under medical supervision.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss appropriate action.

* **Q: How should I store epoprostenol?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of epoprostenol?** A: Long-term use requires careful monitoring for potential side effects and adjustments in the dosage as needed.
