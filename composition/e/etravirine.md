# Etravirine
### Generic Name
Etravirine

### Usage
Etravirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat HIV-1 infection in patients who have already received other antiretroviral treatments (treatment-experienced patients).  It's specifically indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older weighing at least 10 kg.  Etravirine is *not* used as a first-line treatment for HIV-1 infection in individuals who have never received antiretroviral therapy (treatment-naive patients).

### Dosage

**Adults (HIV-1 infection):** The typical dose is 200 mg twice daily (BID) orally.

**Children (HIV-1 infection, aged ≥2 years and weighing at least 10 kg):**  Dosage is weight-based and given orally twice daily:

* 10 kg to <20 kg: 100 mg BID
* 20 kg to <25 kg: 125 mg BID
* 25 kg to <30 kg: 150 mg BID
* ≥30 kg: 200 mg BID

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Dosage recommendations for patients with severe hepatic impairment or renal impairment are not established.  Always consult a healthcare professional for specific dosing instructions based on individual patient factors.


**Administration:** Etravirine tablets should be taken with food. If a patient cannot swallow the tablets whole, they can be dispersed in a small amount of water (enough to cover the tablets), stirred until milky, and then mixed with approximately 15 mL of water, milk, or orange juice.  The mixture should be consumed immediately. Do not use carbonated drinks or water warmer than 40°C.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Nausea

* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Increased triglyceride levels
* Increased amylase and creatinine levels
* Diarrhea
* Gastrointestinal disturbances
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (occurring in <1% of patients):**

* Erythema multiforme (a type of skin reaction)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) – a severe skin reaction
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) – a life-threatening skin reaction
* Hypersensitivity reactions (severe allergic reactions)
* Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue)
* Amnesia
* Anemia
* Anorexia
* Diabetes mellitus
* Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Hemorrhagic stroke
* Hepatic dysfunction (liver problems)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Syncope (fainting)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Etravirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  It works by directly binding to the reverse transcriptase enzyme, a protein vital for HIV replication. By binding to this enzyme, etravirine prevents it from converting the HIV RNA into DNA, thus blocking the virus's ability to integrate into the host cell's genetic material and replicate. This ultimately reduces the viral load in the body.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Etravirine should not be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity to etravirine or any component of the formulation. It is also contraindicated with specific hepatitis C combination regimens (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir) and medications containing dasabuvir.

**Interactions:** Etravirine can interact with many other medications, including but not limited to:  itraconazole, ketoconazole, immunosuppressants, clarithromycin, erythromycin, methadone, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, CYP3A4 substrates, antiarrhythmics, voriconazole, warfarin, diazepam, CYP2C19 substrates, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and ritonavir.  These interactions can either increase or decrease the effectiveness of etravirine or other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Warnings:**  Etravirine carries an increased risk of fat redistribution, immune reconstitution syndrome, and skin reactions/hypersensitivity.  It is not recommended in pregnant women or nursing mothers unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Its use in pregnant patients is generally limited to those already on ART and only continued if they are achieving effective viral suppression and tolerating the medication well. Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers taking etravirine.

**Vulnerable Groups:**  Special caution should be exercised when prescribing etravirine to patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and careful monitoring is necessary.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take etravirine with other medications?** A:  Etravirine can interact with many medications. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q: How should I store etravirine?** A: Store etravirine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking etravirine?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption may be acceptable but discuss this with your healthcare professional. Excessive alcohol use should be avoided.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q: Is etravirine a cure for HIV?** A: No, etravirine is not a cure for HIV. It's part of a combination therapy that helps manage the infection and improve the quality of life.
