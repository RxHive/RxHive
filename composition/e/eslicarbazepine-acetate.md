# Eslicarbazepine Acetate
### Generic Name
Eslicarbazepine Acetate

### Usage
Eslicarbazepine acetate is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat partial-onset seizures in individuals aged 4 years and older.  Partial-onset seizures originate in a specific area of the brain and can spread to other areas, causing a variety of symptoms.  This medication can be used as monotherapy (the sole seizure medication) or as adjunctive therapy (in combination with other anti-seizure medications) to better control seizures.


### Dosage

**Adults (Partial-onset seizures):**

* **Initial Dose:**  Typically 400 mg once daily (OD). In some cases, the doctor may start with 800 mg OD, balancing the need for quicker seizure control against a slightly higher risk of early side effects.
* **Titration:** The dose is increased in weekly increments of 400-600 mg, depending on how well the medication is working and how well it's tolerated.
* **Maintenance Dose:** The usual maintenance dose is 800-1600 mg OD. For monotherapy, if 1200 mg/day isn't tolerated, 800 mg/day may be sufficient. For adjunctive therapy, 1600 mg/day may be necessary if a satisfactory response isn't seen at 1200 mg/day.
* **Discontinuation:**  The dose should be gradually reduced to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency or status epilepticus (a prolonged seizure). Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.

**Children (Partial-onset seizures, ages 4-17):**

Dosage depends on weight:

* **11-21 kg:** Initial dose 200 mg OD; maximum 600 mg/day.
* **22-31 kg:** Initial dose 300 mg OD; maximum 800 mg/day.
* **32-38 kg:** Initial dose 300 mg OD; maximum 900 mg/day.
* **>38 kg:** Initial dose 400 mg OD; maximum 1200 mg/day.

In all children, the dose is increased in weekly increments of no more than the initial daily dose, based on response and tolerability.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is usually needed for mild to moderate impairment.  Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication (medication should not be used).
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min).  Consult a doctor for specific guidelines as this requires careful monitoring and titration.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific recommendations for mild impairment or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,  requiring careful medical oversight.
* **Concomitant medications:**  The dose of eslicarbazepine acetate, or other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs),  might need adjustment if taken with other AEDs, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone, due to interactions that may affect how the drugs are processed in the body.

### How it Works

Eslicarbazepine acetate is metabolized in the body to eslicarbazepine, the active form of the drug. Eslicarbazepine is believed to work by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in the brain. These channels play a role in the electrical activity of nerve cells. By blocking these channels, eslicarbazepine helps to stabilize the electrical activity of the brain and reduce the likelihood of seizures.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Eslicarbazepine acetate is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to eslicarbazepine acetate, oxcarbazepine, or related components; and those with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block.
* **Interactions:**  Eslicarbazepine acetate can interact with numerous medications, including other anti-epileptic drugs, statins, hormonal contraceptives, and various other drugs metabolized through similar pathways in the liver.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Eslicarbazepine acetate is a Pregnancy Category C drug; meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  It's also excreted in breast milk.  Discussions with the doctor about risks and benefits are vital if pregnancy or breastfeeding is a consideration. Women of childbearing age should utilize additional or alternative non-hormonal contraception while taking this drug.
* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of suicidal behavior and ideation, serious dermatological reactions (SJS, TEN, DRESS), anaphylactic reactions, hyponatremia, neurological adverse reactions, liver injury, and decreased thyroid hormone levels.  Close monitoring is needed.  Use caution in elderly patients.
