# Elvitegravir
### Generic Name
Elvitegravir

### Usage
Elvitegravir is an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI) used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's crucial to understand that elvitegravir is *not* used as a standalone medication. It's always administered in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.  Specifically, it's used with a protease inhibitor (like atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, or tipranavir) and ritonavir (a boosting agent that increases the levels of the protease inhibitor in the blood).  The combination therapy aims to suppress HIV replication and improve the patient's immune system.  Elvitegravir is typically prescribed for patients who have already received antiretroviral treatment (treatment-experienced patients) and have developed resistance to other HIV drugs.  It is important to note that elvitegravir is *not* recommended for use with protease inhibitors and cobicistat.


### Dosage
Dosage recommendations for elvitegravir vary greatly depending on the accompanying protease inhibitor and ritonavir. It's essential to follow the prescribed regimen precisely as instructed by a physician.  There is no established safe and effective dose for children.

* **Adults (HIV-1 infection, treatment-experienced):** The dosage is either 85 mg once daily (OD) or 150 mg OD.  The specific dose depends entirely on the accompanying protease inhibitor regimen.
    * 85 mg OD is used when co-administered with atazanavir and ritonavir, or lopinavir and ritonavir.
    * 150 mg OD is used when co-administered with darunavir and ritonavir, fosamprenavir and ritonavir, or tipranavir and ritonavir.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B). However, elvitegravir is not recommended for those with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) due to a lack of established safety and efficacy data. Renal impairment usually doesn't require dosage adjustment.
* **Administration:** Elvitegravir should always be taken with food.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) can include:

* Headache
* Depression
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Suicidal ideation
* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Vomiting
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects may also occur. It's crucial to report any adverse effects to your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Elvitegravir is an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor (INSTI).  HIV needs to integrate its genetic material into the DNA of human cells to replicate. Elvitegravir works by binding to the HIV enzyme integrase, thus preventing this crucial step in the viral replication cycle.  By blocking integration, elvitegravir effectively inhibits HIV from multiplying and spreading within the body.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Elvitegravir is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to elvitegravir or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Elvitegravir can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  The combination of elvitegravir with a protease inhibitor and cobicistat is not recommended due to the potential for suboptimal plasma concentrations and the development of drug resistance.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Elvitegravir is a Category B drug in pregnancy. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all pregnant patients living with HIV, elvitegravir-containing regimens are not recommended due to inadequate serum concentrations observed during pregnancy. Frequent viral load monitoring is recommended if continued.  Breastfeeding is not recommended for individuals with HIV due to the risk of transmission.
* **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS):**  IRIS is a condition that can occur when the immune system begins to recover and react to opportunistic infections that were previously suppressed.  Itâ€™s important to be aware of this possibility during elvitegravir therapy.
* **Resistance Development:** The potential for the development of drug resistance exists if the medication is not taken as prescribed.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I stop taking elvitegravir if I feel better?** A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to the development of drug resistance and a rebound in viral load.  It is crucial to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.
* **Q: How should I store elvitegravir?** A: Store elvitegravir as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of taking elvitegravir?** A: Long-term effects vary depending on individual response to the drug and other factors. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential to manage potential side effects and assess overall health.
* **Q:  Is elvitegravir a cure for HIV?** A: No, elvitegravir is not a cure for HIV.  It's an antiretroviral medication that helps to suppress the virus and improve the patient's immune system.
