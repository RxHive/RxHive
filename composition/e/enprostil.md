# Enprostil
### Generic Name
Enprostil

### Usage
Enprostil is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 analog primarily used to treat duodenal and gastric ulcers.  It's a medication that protects the stomach and duodenal lining from the damaging effects of stomach acid. While its use is less common now compared to other ulcer treatments, it remains an option, particularly in cases where other medications have proven ineffective.

### Dosage
**Adults:**

* **Duodenal Ulcer:** The typical oral dose is 35 mcg twice daily (BID). Treatment usually lasts 4-6 weeks.
* **Gastric Ulcer:** The typical oral dose is also 35 mcg BID. Treatment may extend to 6-8 weeks.


**Children:** The safety and efficacy of enprostil in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

### Side Effects
* Diarrhea (a common side effect)
* Mild headache (a common side effect)

While less common, more serious side effects can occur.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any unusual or concerning symptoms develop.

### How it Works
Enprostil works by mimicking the actions of prostaglandin E2, a naturally occurring substance in the body that protects the stomach lining.  It achieves this protection in two ways:  by reducing the secretion of stomach acid and by inhibiting the release of gastrin, a hormone that stimulates acid production. By decreasing the amount of stomach acid and enhancing the protective mechanisms of the stomach lining, enprostil helps ulcers to heal.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Enprostil is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in pregnant women due to a significant risk of abortion, uterine contractions, and uterine bleeding. It is also contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to prostaglandins or prostaglandin analogs.

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or severely impaired hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) function.

* **Other Precautions:** Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception while taking enprostil.  Enprostil may mask symptoms of gastric malignancy (cancer), potentially delaying diagnosis.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for enprostil to work?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement in ulcer symptoms varies, but healing typically occurs within 4-8 weeks of treatment.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking enprostil?** A:  Alcohol can irritate the stomach lining and may interfere with ulcer healing.  It's advisable to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking enprostil.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store enprostil?** A: Store enprostil at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Is enprostil better than other ulcer medications?** A: Enprostil offers a different mechanism of action compared to other ulcer medications like H2 blockers (e.g., ranitidine) or proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole). While it has a role to play, especially when other treatments have failed, it's not necessarily superior in all cases. A doctor will determine the most suitable treatment based on individual needs and circumstances.  It may have some benefits for particular patients.
