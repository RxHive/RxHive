# Ergotamine + Caffeine
### Generic Name
Ergotamine + Caffeine

### Usage

Ergotamine and caffeine combination is primarily used for the acute treatment of vascular headaches, specifically migraine and migraine variants, or histaminic cephalalgia.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is used *only* when a migraine attack begins; it's not a preventative medication taken regularly.  The combination of ergotamine (an ergot alkaloid) and caffeine works synergistically to alleviate migraine symptoms.  Ergotamine constricts blood vessels in the brain, reducing the throbbing pain associated with migraines, while caffeine enhances this effect and also provides an additional analgesic effect.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Ergotamine and caffeine should be administered at the very first sign of a migraine attack.  It is not for prophylactic (preventative) use.  Exceeding the recommended dosage can lead to serious side effects.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Oral:** The typical starting dose is two tablets (containing 2 mg ergotamine and 200 mg caffeine) at the onset of the headache.  This may be followed by one tablet every 30 minutes as needed, up to a maximum of six tablets per attack. Do not exceed ten tablets per week.
* **Rectal (Suppository):**  One suppository (containing 2 mg ergotamine and 100 mg caffeine) can be used at the first sign of an attack. A second suppository may be used after one hour if needed. The maximum dose per attack is two suppositories. Do not exceed five suppositories per week.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of ergotamine and caffeine in children have not been established.  Its use is generally not recommended for pediatric patients.  Newer and safer migraine treatments are generally preferred for children and adolescents.  If used in adolescents, the dosage needs to be carefully adjusted by a physician, usually starting with lower doses than in adults and carefully monitoring for side effects.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include: nausea, vomiting, and cold extremities.

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Vasospasm (constriction of blood vessels)
* Numbness and paresthesia (pins and needles sensation)
* ECG changes
* Edema (swelling)
* Ischemia (reduced blood flow to tissues)
* Allergic reactions (such as skin rash, itching)
* Gangrene (tissue death due to lack of blood supply) – a rare but severe complication
* Retroperitoneal fibrosis (scarring of tissues behind the abdomen) – rare
* Pleuropulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue) – rare


**If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Ergotamine is an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent that directly stimulates smooth muscles in peripheral and cranial blood vessels. It also acts as a serotonin antagonist. This action helps to constrict blood vessels in the brain, thereby reducing the throbbing pain and inflammation associated with migraines. Caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant, enhances ergotamine's vasoconstricting effect, making it more potent at lower doses, thus reducing the risk of side effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to ergotamine or caffeine, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, sepsis, liver or kidney impairment, and pregnancy.  It should also be avoided during breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid concurrent use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (certain antibiotics, HIV medications, antifungals), other vasoconstrictors (including triptans, nicotine, sympathomimetics), and estrogen-based contraceptives.  Interactions with beta-blockers, fluoroquinolones, mexiletine, fluvoxamine, and oral contraceptives may also occur.  Grapefruit juice may also increase blood levels of ergotamine. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions before using this medicine.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ergotamine and caffeine are contraindicated during pregnancy (Category X) and should be avoided during breastfeeding due to the potential for adverse effects on the infant.
* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution in older adults due to increased risk of cardiovascular events.
* **Overuse:** Chronic or excessive use can lead to medication overuse headache, as well as potentially serious side effects like gangrene.
