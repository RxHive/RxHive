# Ergotamine + Caffeine

**Generic Name:** Ergotamine and Caffeine

**Usage:**

Ergotamine and caffeine is used to treat migraine headaches.  It's typically used for *abortive* treatment, meaning it's taken *after* a migraine has started to help stop the pain and associated symptoms like nausea and vomiting.  It is *not* intended for preventative treatment of migraines. It's most effective when taken at the very first sign of a migraine or as early as possible in the headache's development.  It's not recommended for use more than 10 days a month.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea and vomiting (ironically, despite sometimes being used to treat these symptoms)
* Dizziness
* Weakness
* Tingling or numbness in the fingers and toes
* Coldness in the extremities
* Muscle pain
* Feeling tired or fatigued

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* Chest pain or tightness
* Irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Severe leg pain (ergotism)
* Seizures
* Vision changes


**How it Works:**

Ergotamine is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows blood vessels in the brain.  This is believed to help relieve migraine pain by reducing the dilation (widening) of blood vessels that often occurs during a migraine attack.  Caffeine enhances the effectiveness of ergotamine by improving its absorption and helping to constrict blood vessels.  The exact mechanism of how it alleviates migraine pain is not fully understood.

**FAQs:**

* **How often can I take this medication?**  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Generally, it shouldn't be taken more than 10 days per month to avoid potential adverse effects and developing medication overuse headaches.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. If you are in the early stages of a migraine, take a dose as soon as you remember, but if your headache is already severe, contact your doctor before taking medication.

* **Can I take this medication with other drugs?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting ergotamine and caffeine.  Interactions can occur with certain medications, including other migraine treatments and some antidepressants.

* **Is this medication right for me?**  This medication is not suitable for everyone.  People with certain conditions, such as heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, liver or kidney disease, should not take this medication without consulting a doctor.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also discuss this with their doctor before use.

* **What if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor immediately.
