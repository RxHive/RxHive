# Eliglustat
### Generic Name
Eliglustat

### Usage
Eliglustat is primarily used for the long-term treatment of Gaucher disease type 1 in adults.  This is a lysosomal storage disorder where a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase leads to a buildup of glucosylceramide in cells.  Eliglustat's use is specifically indicated for adults who are extensive, intermediate, or poor metabolizers of CYP2D6, as determined by an FDA-cleared test.  It's important to note that Eliglustat is not suitable for use in children, and its efficacy in ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers hasn't been established.

### Dosage
Dosage for Gaucher disease in adults depends on CYP2D6 metabolizer status:

* **Extensive and Intermediate Metabolizers (EMs and IMs):** 84 mg twice daily (BID).
* **Poor Metabolizers (PMs):** 84 mg once daily (OD).

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on hepatic and renal function, and concomitant medications that interact with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 enzymes. Specific recommendations for these adjustments are complex and require careful consideration of the patient's CYP2D6 status, the type and strength of interacting medications (inhibitors or inducers), and the degree of hepatic or renal impairment. Refer to the detailed prescribing information for these complex scenarios.  Use in children is not recommended as safety and effectiveness haven't been established.

The medication is administered orally as capsules.  Capsules should be swallowed whole with water; do not crush, break, or open them.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (&gt;10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Limb pain

Less common, but still notable side effects (1-10% of patients) include:

* Migraine
* Dizziness
* Palpitations
* Cough
* Oropharyngeal pain
* Flatulence
* Upper abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Constipation
* Skin rash
* Weakness


Serious side effects are less frequent but can occur.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Eliglustat works by inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase, an enzyme involved in the production of glucosylceramide. By reducing the production of this substance, which accumulates in Gaucher disease, Eliglustat helps to alleviate the symptoms of the disease and prevent further organ damage. This mechanism is known as substrate reduction therapy (SRT).

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Eliglustat is contraindicated in several scenarios, including hypersensitivity to the drug, certain combinations of hepatic impairment and CYP2D6 metabolizer status, and concomitant use of specific CYP2D6 and CYP3A inhibitors and inducers depending on the patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status. Detailed contraindications are extensive and depend heavily on the patient's clinical status and other medications they take; reviewing the full prescribing information is critical.

* **Drug Interactions:** Eliglustat interacts with several drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers or certain inhibitors (especially combinations of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors) may significantly affect Eliglustat levels and efficacy, potentially requiring dose adjustments or contraindicating its use.  Close monitoring is vital when administering Eliglustat alongside other medications.

* **Warnings:**  Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions should be closely monitored as ECG changes have been reported.  Those with pre-existing heart problems, long QT syndrome, or those taking certain antiarrhythmic drugs should avoid Eliglustat.  Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful evaluation of the risks and benefits.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments, or contraindications,  are necessary depending on the severity of hepatic or renal impairment and the patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status.

### FAQs
* **Can I take Eliglustat with food?**  Eliglustat can be taken with or without food.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **How should I store Eliglustat?**  Store at room temperature and protect from moisture. Specific storage conditions are usually outlined on the packaging.

* **Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Eliglustat?** No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they can interact with the medication.

* **Is Eliglustat safe for children?** No, the safety and effectiveness of Eliglustat have not been established in children.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any adverse effects, especially if they are severe or persistent.  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new medication, including Eliglustat, and follow their instructions carefully.  They can assess your individual needs and provide personalized guidance on dosage, potential interactions, and monitoring.
