# Etelcalcetide
### Generic Name
Etelcalcetide

### Usage
Etelcalcetide is primarily used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are undergoing hemodialysis.  SHPT is a condition where the parathyroid glands become overactive, producing excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH).  This excess PTH can lead to bone disease, cardiovascular problems, and other complications in individuals with CKD. Etelcalcetide helps to lower the levels of PTH, thus managing the symptoms and progression of SHPT.  It's specifically indicated for patients on hemodialysis; its use in other CKD patient populations isn't recommended.

### Dosage

Etelcalcetide is administered intravenously (IV) as a bolus injection. Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's PTH level and corrected serum calcium levels.  It's crucial to monitor these parameters closely throughout treatment.


**Adults (Secondary Hyperparathyroidism):**

* **Initiation:** 5 mg IV three times per week at the end of a hemodialysis session.
* **Maintenance:**  The dose is adjusted based on PTH and corrected serum calcium levels. The dose can be increased in increments of 2.5 mg or 5 mg, but not more frequently than every four weeks. The lowest maintenance dose is 2.5 mg three times weekly, and the highest is 15 mg three times weekly.
* **Titration:** Serum calcium should be measured within one week of starting or adjusting the dose, and then every four weeks during maintenance.  PTH levels are assessed four weeks after starting or adjusting the dose.
* **Missed Dose:** If a hemodialysis session is missed, the Etelcalcetide dose should be skipped.  Resume the medication at the end of the next hemodialysis treatment.  If doses are missed for more than two weeks, restart with 5 mg (or 2.5 mg if that was the last dose) three times per week.
* **Dosage Adjustments based on PTH levels:** If PTH is below 100 pg/mL (10.6 pmol/L), the dose needs to be reduced or temporarily stopped. If the PTH remains below target after reduction, the medication should be stopped entirely.  Reinitiation is possible at a lower dose once PTH rises above 150 pg/mL (15.9 pmol/L), and the corrected serum calcium is ≥8.3 mg/dL (2.08 mmol/L).
* **Dosage Adjustments based on Corrected Serum Calcium levels:**  If corrected serum calcium is <8.3 mg/dL (2.08 mmol/L) but ≥7.5 mg/dL (1.88 mmol/L) (with or without symptoms), consider reducing the dose or using additional therapies to raise calcium levels. If corrected serum calcium is <7.5 mg/dL (1.88 mmol/L) or there are symptoms of hypocalcemia, stop Etelcalcetide until calcium levels normalize and symptoms resolve.  Reinitiate at a dose 5 mg lower than the previous dose (or 2.5 mg if the previous dose was 2.5 mg or 5 mg).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Etelcalcetide in children have not been established.


**Administration:**  Administer as an undiluted IV bolus into the venous line of the dialysis circuit after hemodialysis, either during rinse-back or immediately afterward. If administered during rinse-back, ensure a sufficient rinse volume (e.g., 150 mL).  If given after rinse-back, flush the IV line with at least 10 mL of saline.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium)
* Hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphorus)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Muscle spasms

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Prolonged QT interval on ECG (electrocardiogram)
* Cardiac failure
* Hyperkalemia (high blood potassium)
* Vomiting
* Antibody development
* Myalgia (muscle pain)

**Rare/Post-Marketing Side Effects (<1%):**

* Anaphylaxis
* Cardiac insufficiency
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Etelcalcetide is a calcimimetic agent. It works by binding to and activating the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on parathyroid cells. This activation reduces the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), thereby lowering elevated PTH levels in patients with SHPT.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Etelcalcetide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using Etelcalcetide have an increased risk of hypocalcemia, worsening heart failure, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, adynamic bone disease, QT prolongation, and ventricular arrhythmias (especially secondary to hypocalcemia).
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of seizures.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid concurrent use with cinacalcet. Monitor closely when used with denosumab. Consider therapy modification when used with siponimod.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Etelcalcetide during pregnancy is unknown.  Breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with renal impairment.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is provided in the manufacturer's labeling.
