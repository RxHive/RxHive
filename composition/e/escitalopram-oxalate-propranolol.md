# Escitalopram Oxalate + Propranolol

**Generic Name:** Escitalopram Oxalate + Propranolol

**Usage:**  This combination is **not** a standard, FDA-approved, or commercially available fixed-dose combination.  Escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) and propranolol (Inderal) are prescribed separately and sometimes concurrently, but not usually as a pre-mixed medication.  The combination might be prescribed off-label by a doctor in specific situations where the benefits outweigh the risks for an individual patient.  This usually involves managing symptoms of anxiety disorders where both antidepressant and beta-blocker effects are desired.  For example, it might be used to treat anxiety with significant somatic symptoms like tremor or rapid heartbeat.

**Side Effects:** The side effects will be a combination of those associated with both escitalopram and propranolol.  They can be numerous and vary in severity from person to person.


* **Escitalopram (SSRI):** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, drowsiness, insomnia, headache, dizziness, sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty achieving orgasm), increased sweating, weight changes (gain or loss), anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, tremor, fatigue.  Rarely, serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition).

* **Propranolol (Beta-blocker):**  Slowed heart rate (bradycardia), low blood pressure (hypotension), dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, cold extremities, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, bronchospasm (in individuals with asthma or COPD), masking of hypoglycemia (in diabetics), sexual dysfunction.


**How it Works:**

* **Escitalopram:** Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It works by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, sleep, and other functions.  This helps alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety.

* **Propranolol:** Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (beta-blocker). It works by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on the heart and blood vessels. This leads to a reduction in heart rate, blood pressure, and tremor â€“ often helpful in managing the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as palpitations, sweating, and shaking.

* **Who should not take this combination?** Individuals with certain heart conditions, asthma, diabetes, or other medical conditions should not take this combination without consulting a doctor.  People taking MAO inhibitors should avoid escitalopram.
