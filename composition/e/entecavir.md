# Entecavir
### Generic Name
Entecavir

### Usage
Entecavir is a medication primarily used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.  It's prescribed for patients who show signs of active viral replication, along with either persistently elevated liver enzymes (transaminases) or evidence of liver inflammation seen on a liver biopsy.  While its primary use is in treating chronic HBV, entecavir may also be used off-label in other situations, such as preventing HBV reinfection after a liver transplant or preventing reactivation of HBV in immunocompromised individuals.  These off-label uses require careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  The dosage of entecavir for HBV infection varies depending on several factors.  For those who have never received antiviral treatment for HBV (nucleoside-na√Øve) and have compensated liver disease, the usual starting dose is 0.5 mg once daily.  However, individuals with decompensated liver disease or those whose HBV infection has not responded to lamivudine (another antiviral drug) will typically receive 1 mg once daily.

**Children:**  Dosage for children aged 2 to less than 16 years with compensated liver disease varies considerably based on weight, ranging from 0.15 mg to 0.5 mg daily. For adolescents 16 years and older, the dosage is similar to adults.  Children with lamivudine resistance may require higher doses.  Precise dosing guidelines for children are complex and should always be determined by a physician.

**Administration:** Entecavir is given orally, either as a tablet or oral solution (liquid).  The oral solution should not be mixed with other liquids; use a calibrated syringe for accurate measurement.  It's best absorbed when taken on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours before or after a meal).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney function significantly impacts entecavir metabolism.  Individuals with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min) need dose adjustments or less frequent dosing to prevent drug accumulation.  Dosage adjustments are also necessary for those with severe liver disease and should be determined by a physician.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**

* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT)
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Skin rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Lactic acidosis (a dangerous buildup of lactic acid in the blood)
* Severe liver damage (including liver failure)
* Worsening of hepatitis B
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Severe allergic reactions

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any adverse effects, particularly if they are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Entecavir is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).  It works by interfering with the hepatitis B virus's ability to replicate.  Specifically, it's converted into its active form (entecavir triphosphate) inside cells.  This active form inhibits the viral polymerase, an enzyme crucial for the virus's replication cycle, effectively reducing the amount of virus in the body and allowing the liver to heal.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Entecavir should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to entecavir or any of its ingredients.
* **Kidney Disease:** Dose adjustments are crucial for people with kidney problems to avoid toxic drug build-up.
* **Liver Disease:** While used to treat liver disease, careful monitoring of liver function is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Entecavir is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects on the fetus are unknown.  The decision to use it during pregnancy should be made in consultation with a doctor. The excretion of entecavir in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Entecavir can interact with other medications, particularly other antiviral drugs like ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and ribavirin.  Inform your doctor about all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **HIV Coinfection:**  Entecavir is not typically recommended for individuals with both HIV and HBV unless they are receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV, as there's a risk of developing resistance to HIV medications.
* **Hepatitis B Exacerbation:**  Stopping entecavir abruptly can lead to a severe worsening of hepatitis B.  Discontinuation should only be done under strict medical supervision with careful monitoring of liver function.



### FAQs

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking entecavir?**
A:  It's generally advisable to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while on entecavir, as alcohol can further stress the liver. Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

**Q: How should I store entecavir?**
A: Store entecavir tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Follow the storage instructions provided with your medication.

**Q: What if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Don't take a double dose.

**Q: How long will I need to take entecavir?**
A:  The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on individual response to treatment, viral load, and liver health.  Long-term treatment is often necessary, and your doctor will determine the appropriate duration.

**Q: Does entecavir cure hepatitis B?**
A: No, entecavir does not cure hepatitis B, but it can suppress the virus and prevent liver damage.  Treatment is typically lifelong to prevent viral recurrence.
