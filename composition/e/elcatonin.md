# Elcatonin
### Generic Name
Elcatonin

### Usage
Elcatonin is a synthetic version of calcitonin, a hormone naturally produced by the body.  Its primary use is in managing conditions characterized by high blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia), particularly that arising from malignancy. It's also used to treat Paget's disease of bone, a condition where bone is broken down and reformed too quickly, leading to weakened bones.  Finally, it can be used to prevent acute bone loss, often in situations like prolonged immobilization after surgery or injury.


### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration (intramuscular injection is most common).  Always follow the prescription instructions given by your doctor.  Information below is for general understanding only and should not be interpreted as a substitute for medical advice.

* **Acute Bone Loss Prevention (Intramuscular):** Typically starts at 40 units daily.  The doctor may adjust this to 40 units two or three times weekly for maintenance, continuing for at least a year or until the patient is fully mobilized.

* **Paget's Disease (Intramuscular):** Usually begins with 40 units daily.  The dose may be adjusted based on individual response and can continue for at least 3 months, potentially longer.

* **Hypercalcemia of Malignancy (Intramuscular):**  Often starts at 40 units every 6-8 hours. The dose might increase to a maximum of 80 units every 6-8 hours if needed, and in some cases, intravenous administration may be considered after rehydration.

* **Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of elcatonin in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, diarrhea)
* Tingling in the hands
* Skin rash
* Unpleasant taste
* Inflammation at the injection site
* Increased urinary frequency
* Tremor
* Transient hypocalcemia (low blood calcium, particularly with parenteral administration)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, may also occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or severe symptoms.


### How it Works
Elcatonin works by mimicking the actions of natural calcitonin. It primarily reduces high blood calcium levels by inhibiting bone breakdown (resorption) and promoting calcium excretion in the urine.  It does this by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts (cells that break down bone) and influencing the reabsorption of calcium and other minerals by the kidneys.  This helps to restore normal calcium balance in the body.  In Paget's disease, this slows the abnormal bone turnover, leading to less pain and improved bone health.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Elcatonin should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to elcatonin or other calcitonins, those with hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), and patients in late pregnancy.

* **Caution:** Exercise caution when using elcatonin in patients with renal impairment, heart failure, or a history of allergies, asthma, or allergic reactions to medications (increased risk of hypersensitivity).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of elcatonin during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been established.  It's generally advised to avoid use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

* **Injection Site:**  When administering intramuscularly, care should be taken to avoid nerve damage. Rotate injection sites to prevent irritation.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see effects varies depending on the condition and dosage.  For hypercalcemia, a response may be seen relatively quickly, while for Paget's disease, improvements may take longer.

* **Q: Can I take elcatonin with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.

* **Q: How should I store elcatonin?** A: Store elcatonin as directed on the product label, usually refrigerated.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
