**Generic Name:** Enalapril/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by lowering the amount of sodium and water in your body, and relaxing blood vessels, thus reducing blood pressure. It may also be used to treat heart failure.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and condition.  This is not a complete list of all possible uses and should not be taken without a doctor's prescription.

**How it Works:**

Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor).  It works by blocking the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, which narrows blood vessels. By blocking this hormone, enalapril allows blood vessels to relax and widen, lowering blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It works by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. This reduces the volume of fluid in the bloodstream, further lowering blood pressure.  The combination of these two drugs provides a synergistic effect, meaning they work better together than they would individually.
