# Estradiol + Dienogest
### Generic Name
Estradiol + Dienogest

### Usage
Estradiol and Dienogest is a combined oral contraceptive pill used primarily for birth control in women.  Its four-phasic formulation releases varying amounts of estrogen (estradiol valerate) and progestin (dienogest) throughout the 28-day cycle. This combination prevents pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation.  It also thickens cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg, and may alter the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.  A secondary, approved use is in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) in women without underlying medical conditions who choose oral contraceptives as their method of birth control.


### Dosage
**Contraception or treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding:**  The medication is taken orally, one tablet daily at the same time each day, following the order indicated on the blister pack.  The pack contains tablets with varying doses of estradiol valerate and dienogest.  It's crucial to take the tablets in the prescribed sequence.  Do not skip tablets or delay intake by more than 12 hours.  For initiating contraception, start on the first day of the menstrual cycle and use a non-hormonal backup method (like condoms) for the first nine days.

**Initiating after pregnancy:** The timing of starting Estradiol + Dienogest after pregnancy depends on the type of delivery and individual risk factors.  Generally, it should not be started before 21 days postpartum.  The CDC recommends waiting 3-6 weeks after vaginal delivery and at least 6 weeks after a Cesarean section for women without additional VTE risks. Women with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) should avoid combined hormonal contraceptives postpartum.

**Pediatric Dosage:** This medication is not intended for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The medication is contraindicated in individuals with hepatic disease.  Renal impairment does not typically necessitate dosage adjustments, though safety and efficacy haven't been fully established in this population.  Switching from other hormonal contraceptives requires specific instructions detailed in the prescribing information;  a non-hormonal backup method is usually advised for the first nine days after switching.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of users) may include headache.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of users include:

*   Mood changes
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Acne
*   Menstrual irregularities
*   Breast changes (tenderness, etc.)
*   Weight gain
*   Uterine bleeding


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include thromboembolic events (blood clots), increased risk of certain cancers, and changes in lipid profiles.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, sudden vision changes, or leg pain.  Any concerning side effect warrants consultation with a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Estradiol + Dienogest is a combined hormonal contraceptive.  Estradiol (an estrogen) and dienogest (a progestin) work together to prevent pregnancy in several ways.  Primarily, they suppress ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  Additionally, they alter cervical mucus, making it thicker and less permeable to sperm, and they modify the uterine lining, making it less receptive to implantation of a fertilized egg.  The four-phasic design provides varying levels of hormones throughout the cycle, mimicking the natural hormonal fluctuations of a woman's menstrual cycle.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of breast cancer or other hormone-dependent cancers, current or past liver tumors or liver disease, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, known hypersensitivity to the components, pregnancy, and women at high risk of venous or arterial thromboembolism.  It should not be used by women over 35 who smoke due to increased risk of cardiovascular events.  Additional precautions apply to individuals with uncontrolled hypertension, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease, diabetes with vascular disease, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies,  and specific types of headaches or heart conditions.

**Interactions:**  This medication can interact with several drugs, including some antibiotics (rifampin, rifabutin), anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin), and other medications affecting liver enzymes.  These interactions can reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions.

**Warnings:**  Increased risk of thromboembolic events, certain cancers (breast, cervical), gallbladder disease, and other conditions exists with the use of this medication.  Careful monitoring is necessary for patients with diabetes, depression, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other pre-existing health issues.  Inform your healthcare provider about any current health conditions or medications.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is contraindicated during pregnancy. It is also not recommended until at least four weeks postpartum and should not be started before 21 days postpartum for non-breastfeeding mothers or four weeks after a second-trimester abortion.  Estrogen can reduce milk production, so alternative contraceptives are typically advised during breastfeeding.
