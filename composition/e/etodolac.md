# Etodolac
### Generic Name
Etodolac

### Usage

Etodolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to manage pain and inflammation.  Its primary use is for the relief of symptoms associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in adults and juvenile arthritis in children.  The immediate-release formulation is also indicated for the treatment of acute pain.  Note that the extended-release formulation is not typically used for acute pain management.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Acute Pain (Immediate-Release):**  200-400 mg every 6-8 hours as needed. The maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.

* **Osteoarthritis & Rheumatoid Arthritis (Immediate-Release):** 400 mg twice daily, 300 mg two to three times daily, or 500 mg twice daily.

* **Osteoarthritis & Rheumatoid Arthritis (Extended-Release):**  The initial dose is typically 400-1000 mg once daily.  The dose may be adjusted based on individual response.  For chronic conditions, it usually takes 1-2 weeks to see a noticeable effect.

**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children and adolescents varies significantly based on age and weight and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  The immediate-release formulation is used for acute pain and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, while the extended-release version is used for juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  Dosage for juvenile idiopathic arthritis depends heavily on the child's weight and is usually given once daily.  Specific dosing instructions must be obtained from a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a healthcare provider for guidance in these situations.  The KDIGO 2012 guidelines for NSAID use in patients with reduced kidney function should also be considered.

### How it Works

Etodolac is a NSAID that works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, etodolac helps to alleviate pain and inflammation. While the primary mechanism is COX inhibition, other mechanisms, like effects on chemotaxis and lymphocyte activity may also play a role.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Etodolac is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to etodolac or other NSAIDs, a history of asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions to aspirin or NSAIDs, active peptic ulcer, or inflammatory bowel disease. It is also contraindicated during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:** Etodolac may interact with numerous medications, including anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, lithium, and other NSAIDs.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Etodolac is a Pregnancy Category C drug.  Its use during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, should be avoided due to potential risks to the fetus.  It is unknown whether etodolac is excreted in breast milk.
* **Geriatric Patients:** Elderly individuals are at increased risk of serious side effects from NSAIDs, including gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney problems.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Patients with reduced kidney or liver function require careful monitoring and may need dosage adjustments.
