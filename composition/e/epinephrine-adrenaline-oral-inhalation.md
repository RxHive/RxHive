# Epinephrine/ Adrenaline (Oral inhalation)
### Generic Name
Epinephrine/Adrenaline (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Epinephrine (oral inhalation) is primarily used for the rapid relief of bronchospasm and mild asthma symptoms.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is **not** intended for the routine, long-term management of asthma.  Instead, it's reserved for acute situations where immediate bronchodilation is needed.  While sometimes used in the treatment of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) and airway edema, its primary application remains in the acute management of bronchospasm.  The use of epinephrine inhalation for these conditions should be guided by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The following dosage information is for general knowledge and should not replace the advice of a healthcare professional.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors.

**Adults (â‰¥12 years):**

* **Bronchospasm/Mild Asthma Symptoms:**
    * **Metered-Dose Inhaler (MDI):** 0.125 mg (1 inhalation) as needed.  Repeat after 1 minute if symptoms persist, but wait at least 4 hours between doses.  The maximum daily dose is 8 inhalations.
    * **Hand-Held Bulb Nebulizer:** 1-3 inhalations of 0.5 mL of a 2.25% solution.  Repeat after at least 3 hours if needed. The maximum daily dose is 12 inhalations.

**Children (4-11 years):**

* **Bronchospasm/Mild Asthma Symptoms:** Dosage for children in this age range should be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Children (<4 years) and Infants:**  The use of epinephrine inhalation in this age group requires careful consideration and is typically only used in specific situations like severe croup under strict medical supervision. The dosage will be determined by a physician. Dosage forms may include nebulized racemic epinephrine or L-epinephrine, and precise administration and dilution are crucial.  

**Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup) and Airway Edema:**  The dosage in these conditions varies greatly depending on the child's age, weight, and severity of the condition.  A physician will calculate the appropriate dose of either racemic epinephrine or L-epinephrine for nebulization. Dilution with normal saline (NS) is often necessary.  

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Tremors
* Headache
* Nervousness
* Increased heart rate
* Palpitations

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and warrant immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions
* Chest pain
* Irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Seizures


Seek immediate medical help if you experience any serious side effects.

### How it Works

Epinephrine works by acting on several receptors in the body.  It stimulates alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. This stimulation leads to several effects, including relaxation of the bronchial muscles (resulting in easier breathing), increased heart rate and contractility, and dilation of blood vessels in skeletal muscles.  By relaxing the airways, epinephrine helps to alleviate the symptoms of bronchospasm and improves breathing.  However, at higher doses, it can cause vasoconstriction.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Epinephrine inhalation is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to epinephrine. Avoid use within 2 weeks of discontinuing MAO inhibitors.  It should not be self-medicated in individuals without a diagnosed asthma condition.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Epinephrine can interact with several medications, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).  Consult your doctor about potential interactions.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in individuals with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, psychiatric disorders, or a history of seizures.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss epinephrine use with their healthcare provider.
* **Other Precautions:** Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and any other symptoms carefully.  Patients should avoid caffeine while using epinephrine.

### FAQs
