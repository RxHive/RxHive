# Ertugliflozin
### Generic Name
Ertugliflozin

### Usage
Ertugliflozin is primarily used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's not suitable for treating type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.  While its main application is in managing blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes, studies have also shown potential benefits in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, specifically hospitalization for heart failure, in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, this is a secondary effect and not the primary reason for prescribing the medication.


### Dosage

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Adults):**

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily (OD) in the morning, taken with or without food.
* **Dose Increase:** If the 5mg dose is tolerated and further blood sugar control is needed, the doctor may increase the dose to 15 mg OD.
* **Maximum Dose:** 15 mg/day.
* **Volume Depletion:**  Patients with volume depletion (dehydration) should have their fluid balance corrected before starting Ertugliflozin.

**Pediatric Dosage:**
The safety and effectiveness of Ertugliflozin in children under 18 have not been established.  It should not be used in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is usually necessary for patients with mild or moderate liver impairment.  Ertugliflozin is not recommended for those with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are crucial based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  No adjustment is needed for eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m².  Ertugliflozin is not recommended for patients with an eGFR between 30 and <60 mL/min/1.73 m²  and is contraindicated for those with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m² or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Genitourinary fungal infections (yeast infections).

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Hypovolemia (low blood volume)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) – particularly when combined with insulin or other blood sugar-lowering medications.
* Increased thirst
* Weight loss
* Back pain

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Acute kidney failure
* Increased hemoglobin levels
* Ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes)
* Pyelonephritis (kidney infection)
* Urinary tract infection (UTI)
* Urinary tract infection with sepsis (severe bloodstream infection)
* Increased LDL cholesterol
* Increased serum phosphate levels
* Decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Lower limb amputation
* Necrotizing fasciitis (a severe, flesh-eating bacterial infection)
* Bone fractures


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ertugliflozin is an SGLT2 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2) inhibitor.  It works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in the kidneys, which is responsible for reabsorbing glucose from the bloodstream back into the body. By inhibiting SGLT2, Ertugliflozin increases the excretion of glucose in the urine, thus lowering blood glucose levels.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ertugliflozin is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to it or its components, severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or those requiring dialysis.
* **Interactions:** Concurrent use with insulin or insulin secretagogues increases the risk of hypoglycemia.  Combining it with diuretics may heighten the risk of dehydration and low blood pressure (hypotension).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ertugliflozin is generally not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and breastfeeding is not advised while taking it.  Other diabetes medications are usually preferred during pregnancy.
* **Other Precautions:**  Ertugliflozin may increase the risk of hypotension, ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infections (including urosepsis and pyelonephritis), lower limb amputations, increased LDL cholesterol, and bone fractures.  Patients should be monitored closely for these potential risks.  Temporary discontinuation may be necessary before surgery.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ertugliflozin with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to discuss all your medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before starting Ertugliflozin to avoid potential interactions.  Some medications, like insulin and diuretics, may need dose adjustments or require special monitoring.

* **Q: How should I store Ertugliflozin?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Ertugliflozin suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Ertugliflozin abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping it suddenly could lead to adverse effects.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce your dosage if necessary.

* **Q: What are the symptoms of ketoacidosis?** A: Ketoacidosis symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a fruity odor to your breath.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect you have ketoacidosis.
