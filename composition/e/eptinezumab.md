# Eptinezumab
### Generic Name
Eptinezumab

### Usage
Eptinezumab is a medication used for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.  Its primary function is to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.  It does *not* treat an acute migraine attack; it's for preventing them from happening in the first place.  Currently, there are no approved secondary uses for eptinezumab.

### Dosage
Eptinezumab is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage for migraine prophylaxis in adults is:

* **Initial dose:** 100 mg given as an IV infusion. This infusion should be administered over approximately 30 minutes using an infusion set with a 0.2-micron or 0.22-micron in-line or add-on sterile filter.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus injection.  Do not mix or infuse other medications in the same infusion set. Following infusion, flush the line with 20 mL of normal saline.
* **Subsequent Doses:** The standard regimen is a 100 mg infusion every 3 months.  However, some patients may benefit from a higher dose of 300 mg every 3 months.  The decision to adjust the dosage should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.

The safety and effectiveness of eptinezumab have not been established in children.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling, as these conditions are not expected to significantly affect the drug's pharmacokinetics.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Development of antibodies (Immunologic)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Fatigue (Nervous System)
* Nausea (Gastrointestinal)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (Hypersensitivity)
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold symptoms) (Respiratory)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling under the skin, especially around the eyes, lips, or tongue)
* Anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your doctor.

### How it Works
Eptinezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody.  This means it's a laboratory-made antibody designed to target a specific molecule in the body. In this case, eptinezumab targets calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is a molecule believed to play a significant role in the development of migraine headaches. By binding to CGRP and blocking its interaction with its receptor, eptinezumab helps prevent the cascade of events that lead to a migraine attack.

### Precautions
Eptinezumab is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema) to eptinezumab or any component of the formulation. There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, urticaria, facial flushing, and rash).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** There is limited data on the use of eptinezumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The benefits and risks should be carefully considered by a healthcare professional before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:**  While specific drug interactions are not extensively documented, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking.
