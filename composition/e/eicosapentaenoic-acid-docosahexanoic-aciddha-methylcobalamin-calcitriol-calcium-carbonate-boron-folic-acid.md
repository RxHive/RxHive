It's important to understand that providing detailed medical information about a combination of substances like this requires a physician's input. The information below is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.  **Always consult a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.**  Self-treating can be dangerous.

**Generic Name:**  This product doesn't have a single generic name as it's a combination of several ingredients. The individual generic names are: Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), Methylcobalamin, Calcitriol, Calcium Carbonate, Boron, and Folic Acid.


**Usage:** This combination of ingredients is often marketed as a multi-nutrient supplement aimed at supporting various aspects of health, including:

* **EPA and DHA:**  These omega-3 fatty acids are important for brain health, heart health, and reducing inflammation.
* **Methylcobalamin:** A form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **Calcitriol:** The active form of vitamin D, essential for calcium absorption, bone health, and immune function.
* **Calcium Carbonate:** A source of calcium, vital for strong bones and teeth, muscle function, and nerve transmission.
* **Boron:** A trace mineral that may play a role in bone health, brain function, and hormone regulation.  The evidence for its benefits is still under investigation.
* **Folic Acid:** A B vitamin crucial for cell growth and development, especially important during pregnancy.


**Side Effects:** Side effects vary depending on the individual and the dosage of each ingredient.  Possible side effects include:

* **EPA and DHA:** Fish burps, nausea, diarrhea, increased bleeding risk (especially in individuals taking blood thinners).
* **Methylcobalamin:**  Generally well-tolerated, but high doses can rarely cause nausea.
* **Calcitriol:**  High doses can cause hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), leading to kidney stones, constipation, and weakness.
* **Calcium Carbonate:**  Constipation, gas, bloating.  Can interfere with the absorption of some medications.
* **Boron:**  In high doses, can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* **Folic Acid:** Usually well-tolerated, but high doses can mask vitamin B12 deficiency.


**How it Works:** Each ingredient works independently and contributes to overall health in different ways.  The combination is intended to provide a synergistic effect, meaning that the combined benefit is greater than the sum of the individual benefits.  However, the degree of synergy for this specific combination isn't definitively established through extensive research.
