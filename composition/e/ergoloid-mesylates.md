# Ergoloid Mesylates

**Generic Name:** Ergoloid mesylates

**Usage:**

Ergoloid mesylates are used to treat symptoms of senile dementia, specifically those related to memory impairment, confusion, and behavioral changes.  It's important to note that its efficacy in significantly improving cognitive function is debated and its use has significantly declined in recent years due to the availability of more effective treatments.  It's often used as an adjunct therapy, meaning it's used in conjunction with other treatments rather than as a standalone medication.  The specific symptoms treated might include:

* Impaired memory
* Difficulty concentrating
* Confusion
* Disorientation
* Behavioral disturbances (though the impact on this is limited)


**Side Effects:**

Ergoloid mesylates can cause a range of side effects, though not everyone experiences them. These can include:

* Gastrointestinal issues: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Skin rash
* Allergic reactions
* Cardiac effects (rare but possible)


**How it Works:**

The exact mechanism of action of ergoloid mesylates isn't fully understood. However, it's thought to improve cerebral blood flow and potentially influence neurotransmitter activity in the brain.  The improvement in blood flow might indirectly lead to improved cognitive function, though evidence for this is not conclusive.  Some theories suggest it may act as an antioxidant or influence the activity of serotonin and dopamine.
