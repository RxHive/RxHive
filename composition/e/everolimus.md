# Everolimus

**Generic Name:** Everolimus

**Usage:** Everolimus is used to treat several types of cancer, including:

* **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):**  Advanced RCC that has progressed after treatment with other medications.  It may be used alone or in combination with other therapies.
* **Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs):** Advanced pancreatic NETs, and advanced lung NETs.  Often used in combination with other treatments.
* **Breast Cancer:**  Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy.  It's typically used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor.
* **Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma (SEGA):** A type of brain tumor associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.
* **Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):** A rare lung disease.


**Side Effects:** Everolimus can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common side effects:**  Mouth sores (stomatitis), diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, rash, decreased appetite,  headache, cough, infections, pneumonitis.
* **Serious side effects:**  Increased risk of bleeding, kidney problems, lung problems (including pneumonitis),  high blood sugar, low blood counts (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), wound healing problems, heart failure, liver problems.
* **Other side effects:**  Hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides),  proteinuria (protein in urine).


**How it Works:** Everolimus is a type of medication called an **mTOR inhibitor**.  mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell growth, division, and survival. By inhibiting mTOR, everolimus interferes with the signaling pathways that promote cancer cell growth and proliferation.  It ultimately slows or stops the growth of cancer cells.
