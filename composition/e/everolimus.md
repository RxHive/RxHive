# Everolimus
### Generic Name
Everolimus

### Usage

Everolimus is a medication primarily used to treat various types of cancer and also plays a crucial role in preventing organ transplant rejection.  Its primary applications in oncology include:

* **Advanced Breast Cancer:**  It's used in postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, typically in combination with other therapies after certain other treatments have failed.

* **Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs):** Everolimus is effective in managing progressive, well-differentiated NETs of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or pancreas that are unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic.

* **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):** This medication is employed in patients with advanced RCC after treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib has proven ineffective.

* **Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Tumors:** Everolimus targets renal angiomyolipomas (benign kidney tumors) and subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SEGAs; brain tumors) associated with TSC, especially in cases where immediate surgery isn't feasible.


Beyond cancer treatment, Everolimus is also indicated for:

* **Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis:**  It helps prevent the rejection of transplanted organs, particularly livers and kidneys, especially in patients considered to be at low to moderate immunological risk.  It's usually given in combination with other immunosuppressants.

* **TSC-Associated Partial-Onset Seizures:**  Everolimus is used adjunctively to control partial-onset seizures linked to TSC.

### Dosage

Everolimus dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and body surface area (BSA), and whether it's combined with other medications.  There are two forms: tablets and tablets for oral suspension (the latter only for TSC-related conditions and requiring therapeutic monitoring).  These formulations are *not* interchangeable.

**Adult Dosages (Examples):**

* **Advanced Breast Cancer:** Typically 10 mg once daily (OD), given with exemestane after letrozole or anastrozole failure.

* **Advanced NETs:** Usually 10 mg OD.

* **Advanced RCC:** Typically 10 mg OD,  or 5 mg OD combined with lenvatinib (off-label combination).

* **TSC-associated Renal Angiomyolipoma:** 10 mg OD.

* **TSC-associated SEGA:** The initial dose is determined by BSA (body surface area):  4.5 mg/m² OD,  or a BSA-based dose (2.5-7.5 mg OD), with adjustments based on blood level monitoring.

* **Organ Transplant Rejection Prophylaxis (Liver or Kidney):** Initial doses vary significantly depending on the organ and combination therapy (e.g., 1 mg twice daily (BID) with tacrolimus and corticosteroids).  Dosage adjustments are based on blood level monitoring.

* **TSC-associated Partial-Onset Seizures:** Initial dose determined by BSA (5 mg/m² OD), with titration based on blood level monitoring to reach a target concentration.


**Pediatric Dosages (Examples):**

Dosage in children is generally based on BSA and the specific condition.  For TSC-associated SEGA and seizures, it's similar to the adult approach with BSA calculations and close monitoring of blood levels.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are frequently necessary based on factors like hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and the occurrence of adverse effects.  These adjustments should always be made under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.  Therapeutic drug monitoring (measuring blood levels) is crucial in many instances, particularly for TSC-related conditions and organ transplant patients.

### Side Effects

Everolimus, like many medications, can cause side effects. The frequency and severity of these side effects vary.  Some common side effects include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Skin rash
* Increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
* Increased cholesterol
* Infections

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Blood clots
* Severe allergic reactions
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML; a rare and serious brain infection)


**If you experience any concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works

Everolimus is a kinase inhibitor that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein involved in cell growth and blood vessel formation.  By inhibiting mTOR, Everolimus slows down the growth of cancer cells and reduces the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that supply tumors. In organ transplant recipients, it suppresses the immune system, reducing the risk of organ rejection. For TSC-associated conditions, Everolimus reduces cell growth and helps manage the symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Everolimus is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it or related medications.

* **Drug Interactions:** Everolimus interacts with many drugs, especially those metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein.  This includes many common medications, herbal supplements (like St. John's Wort), and even grapefruit juice.  These interactions can alter Everolimus levels, leading to either reduced effectiveness or increased side effects.  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you're taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Everolimus is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Everolimus.

* **Specific Populations:**  Dosage adjustments are often needed for patients with liver or kidney problems and children.  Older adults may be more susceptible to certain side effects.

* **Infections:**  Due to its immunosuppressant properties, Everolimus increases the risk of infections.  Patients should report any signs of infection promptly.

* **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of blood counts, kidney function, liver function, and blood glucose levels is necessary for many patients on Everolimus.  In some cases (e.g., TSC-associated conditions, transplantation), therapeutic drug monitoring (measuring drug levels in the blood) is crucial.

### FAQs

* **Can I take Everolimus with food?**  Generally, yes, but consistent timing is important for consistent absorption.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember if it’s within 6 hours.  If it's later, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular scheduled time.  Never double a dose.

* **How should I store Everolimus?** Follow the storage instructions on the label.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Everolimus?**  It's generally best to avoid alcohol.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Can I take other medications while taking Everolimus?**  This is very important to discuss with your doctor or pharmacist.  Many medications can interact with Everolimus.

* **What are the long-term risks of Everolimus?** Long-term use can increase the risk of certain cancers and infections.  Regular monitoring is crucial.
