# Exenatide
### Generic Name
Exenatide

### Usage
Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's used *in addition* to diet and exercise, not as a sole treatment. Importantly, exenatide is **not** suitable for treating type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.  It may be used as an add-on therapy or as an alternative to metformin for individuals who can't tolerate it or haven't seen sufficient improvement with metformin and lifestyle changes.

### Dosage

Exenatide comes in two formulations: immediate-release (twice daily) and extended-release (once weekly).  Dosage instructions differ significantly between the two.

**Immediate-Release (Subcutaneous Injection):**

* **Adults with Type 2 Diabetes:** Begin with 5 mcg twice daily (BID), given approximately 60 minutes before morning and evening meals (at least 6 hours apart).  After one month, the dose may be increased to 10 mcg BID based on individual response and tolerability.

**Extended-Release (Subcutaneous Injection):**

* **Adults with Type 2 Diabetes:**  The standard dose is 2 mg once weekly.  The injection can be given at any time of day, with or without food. The day of the weekly injection can be changed if needed, as long as at least 3 days have passed since the previous dose. If a dose is missed, administer it as soon as possible if the next scheduled dose is at least 3 days away. If less than 3 days remain until the next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular schedule.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of exenatide in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for hepatic impairment. For renal impairment, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional.  Use in individuals with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 30 mL/min or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not recommended for either formulation.  The extended-release formulation requires more stringent restrictions, with use not recommended if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is below 45 mL/min/1.73 mÂ².

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Injection site reactions (including nodules)
* Immunogenicity (body's immune response to the drug)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Injection site pruritus (itching)
* Antibody development

**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), kidney problems, and changes in heart rate.


**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Exenatide mimics a naturally occurring hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).  It works in several ways to improve blood sugar control:

* **Increases insulin release:**  It stimulates the pancreas to release more insulin, particularly when blood glucose levels are high.
* **Decreases glucagon secretion:** It reduces the release of glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar levels.
* **Slows gastric emptying:** This helps prevent a rapid rise in blood sugar after meals.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Exenatide is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to exenatide or its components, a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) (extended-release only), diabetic ketoacidosis, or type 1 diabetes.
* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of thyroid C-cell tumors, acute pancreatitis (including fatal cases), hypoglycemia (especially when used with other glucose-lowering medications), acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal disorders, immunogenicity, hypersensitivity reactions, injection-site reactions, and macrovascular outcomes.  Use caution in patients with renal transplantation.
* **Interactions:** Exenatide may interact with other medications, including oral contraceptives, antibiotics, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and warfarin. Consult a healthcare professional about potential drug interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Exenatide is a category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects on the fetus are unknown.  Other diabetes medications are generally preferred during pregnancy. The excretion of exenatide in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I mix exenatide with other medications in the same syringe?** A: No, exenatide should be injected separately from other medications, including insulin.
* **Q: How should I store exenatide?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided with your specific formulation.  Generally, refrigeration is required.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: The instructions for missed doses vary depending on whether you are using the immediate-release or extended-release formulation. Refer to the prescribing information or contact your healthcare provider.
* **Q: Is exenatide suitable for everyone with type 2 diabetes?** A: No, it's not suitable for all individuals with type 2 diabetes.  Certain conditions, such as severe renal impairment, and other factors may make it unsuitable. Consult your doctor.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking exenatide?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable but excessive alcohol can negatively impact blood sugar control and increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.
