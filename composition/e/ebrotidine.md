# Ebrotidine
### Generic Name
Ebrotidine

### Usage
Ebrotidine is an H2 receptor antagonist primarily used for its gastroprotective effects.  This means it protects the stomach lining from damage.  While it was once used to treat conditions like ulcers and gastritis, its use was discontinued due to safety concerns.  It's important to note that ebrotidine is no longer available on the market.  This information is provided for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its use.

### Dosage
Because ebrotidine is no longer available, providing specific dosage information would be irresponsible and potentially harmful.  Any information found regarding dosing should be disregarded, as it is outdated and potentially unsafe.  If you require treatment for stomach issues, please consult a healthcare professional for current and safe treatment options.

### Side Effects
While ebrotidine was withdrawn due to a risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage), other reported side effects during its time on the market may have included:

*  Nausea
*  Vomiting
*  Diarrhea
*  Constipation
*  Headache
*  Dizziness
*  Rash

**Serious, but less common side effects included the risk of liver damage.**  It is crucial to remember that this drug is no longer available. If experiencing any adverse effects from any medication, contact a doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
Ebrotidine works by blocking H2 receptors in the stomach.  These receptors are responsible for stimulating the production of stomach acid. By blocking these receptors, ebrotidine reduces stomach acid production.  Additionally, it possesses gastroprotective properties, promoting the repair and protection of the stomach lining.  Its anti- *Helicobacter pylori* effects were attributed to its inhibition of the bacteria's urease enzyme and its effects on proteolytic and mucolytic activities.


### Precautions
**Ebrotidine is no longer available on the market due to safety concerns, primarily the risk of liver damage (hepatotoxicity).**  Therefore, all precautions associated with its use are now irrelevant.  It's vital to rely on current and safe medications prescribed by a healthcare professional.
