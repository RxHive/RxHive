# Exemestane
### Generic Name
Exemestane

### Usage
Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor primarily used to treat advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  It's specifically indicated for cases where the cancer has progressed after treatment with tamoxifen.  Additionally, exemestane is used as an adjuvant therapy (a preventative measure alongside other treatments) for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer. In this setting, it follows 2-3 years of tamoxifen therapy, extending the total endocrine therapy to 5 years.  It's important to note that off-label uses, such as first-line adjuvant treatment or breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women over 35, exist but are not formally approved indications.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on appropriate usage.


### Dosage
The standard adult dosage is 25 mg orally once daily.  This applies to both advanced and early breast cancer treatment. For advanced breast cancer, treatment continues until the tumor progresses. In early breast cancer, it's administered after 2-3 years of tamoxifen, extending the total duration of endocrine therapy to 5 years.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in certain cases. For instance, when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin and phenytoin), the dose might increase to 50 mg once daily.  Exemestane is not recommended for use in premenopausal women or children; safety and efficacy haven't been established in these populations.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Pain (headache, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, limb pain)
* Hot flashes
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Weight gain
* Increased appetite
* Hypertension
* Edema
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Depression
* Dizziness
* Hair loss (alpecia)
* Increased sweating (hyperhidrosis)
* Skin rash


Less common but serious side effects, some reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports,  include:  cardiac failure,  hepatitis, thromboembolism, and  osteoporosis.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Exemestane is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens (male hormones) into estrogens (female hormones). By irreversibly inhibiting aromatase, exemestane significantly reduces estrogen levels in the body.  Because many breast cancers depend on estrogen for growth, lowering estrogen levels helps to slow or stop tumor growth.


### Precautions
Exemestane is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.  It's crucial to use caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, or uncontrolled hypertension.  Bone mineral density should be monitored, as exemestane can increase the risk of osteoporosis. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is also necessary.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for one month afterward.  Exemestane is categorized as pregnancy category X, meaning it's expected to cause fetal harm, and breastfeeding is not recommended.  Interactions with other drugs, such as estrogen-containing medications, or certain enzyme inducers or inhibitors, need careful consideration. Always inform your doctor about all other medications you are currently taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Exemestane with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to discuss all current medications with your doctor before starting Exemestane.  Certain interactions, particularly with estrogen or drugs affecting liver enzymes, can be significant.
* **Q: How should I store Exemestane?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How long will I need to take Exemestane?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your specific situation and will be determined by your doctor.
* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of Exemestane?** A:  Long-term use can increase the risk of osteoporosis and other side effects.  Regular monitoring by your doctor helps manage these risks.
