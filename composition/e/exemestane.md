# Exemestane

**Generic Name:** Exemestane

**Usage:** Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor used to treat hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  Specifically, it's used:

* **As adjuvant therapy:** After surgery to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.
* **As first-line therapy:** In some cases, it's used as the initial treatment for advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
* **As second-line or later-line therapy:**  If other hormone therapies haven't been effective.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, exemestane can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity from person to person.  Common side effects include:

* **Musculoskeletal:** Joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), bone pain, stiffness, and decreased bone density (osteoporosis â€“ increased risk of fractures).
* **Metabolic:** Hot flashes, increased cholesterol levels, weight changes.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of cardiovascular events (though evidence is mixed and depends on other factors).
* **Skin and Hair:** Rash, hair thinning.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.
* **Neurological:** Headaches, dizziness.
* **Other:** Vaginal dryness, fatigue, weakness.

**Serious side effects are less common but include:**  Increased risk of fractures, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke), and severe allergic reactions.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Exemestane is an aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens (male hormones) into estrogens (female hormones).  Many breast cancers rely on estrogen to grow. By blocking aromatase, exemestane reduces the amount of estrogen in the body, thus slowing or stopping the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells.


**FAQs:**

* **Is exemestane a chemotherapy drug?** No, it's a hormone therapy, not a chemotherapy drug.  It works differently by targeting hormones instead of directly killing cancer cells.

* **Who shouldn't take exemestane?** Women who are premenopausal (still having periods) generally cannot take exemestane because it won't be effective.  Patients with severe liver or kidney problems may also be unsuitable candidates.  Pre-existing osteoporosis also needs careful consideration.

* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Exemestane can interact with certain medications, so it's vital to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **How long do I need to take exemestane?** The duration of treatment depends on your individual circumstances and response to the medication.  Your oncologist will determine the appropriate treatment length.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.
