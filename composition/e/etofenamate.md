# Etofenamate
### Generic Name
Etofenamate

### Usage
Etofenamate is a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and inflammation in musculoskeletal conditions.  Its main applications are for the symptomatic treatment of soft tissue injuries like bursitis and tendinitis, and trauma-related injuries such as sprains, strains, and bruises.  It works by reducing the production of substances that cause pain and swelling in the affected area.  Etofenamate is applied directly to the skin over the painful area.

### Dosage
**Adults:**  For pain and inflammation, the recommended dosage is a topical application of 75-150 mg (5-10 cm) of the 5% gel to the affected area three or four times daily (TID or QID).  The maximum daily dose should not exceed 450 mg when treating trauma-induced injuries.

**Children and Adolescents:** Etofenamate is contraindicated (not to be used) in children and adolescents.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using etofenamate if you have any pre-existing liver or kidney conditions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site. These may include:

* Burning sensation
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Redness (erythema)
* Contact dermatitis
* Acne vulgaris (in rare cases)
* Urticaria (hives)

Less common but more serious side effects may occur;  seek immediate medical attention if you experience a hypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction).

### How it Works
Etofenamate, like other NSAIDs, works by inhibiting both cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase enzymes.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes â€“ substances that contribute to inflammation, pain, and swelling. By reducing the production of these inflammatory mediators, etofenamate helps alleviate pain and reduce inflammation at the site of application.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Etofenamate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to etofenamate, other NSAIDs (including aspirin), or any component of the formulation.  It should not be applied to broken, infected, or inflamed skin, including areas of eczema.  Use is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and in children and adolescents. Avoid use with occlusive dressings and the concurrent application of other topical products.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Etofenamate is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy due to the potential for suppressing labor, affecting fetal circulation, and increasing bleeding risks.  It is excreted in breast milk, so its use during breastfeeding is not recommended. If used, avoid applying the gel to the breasts.

* **Interactions:** Etofenamate may decrease the protein binding of levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone). Consult your doctor if you are taking levothyroxine or other medications.

* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with asthma, hay fever, nasal polyps, or chronic obstructive airway disease, particularly if hay fever symptoms are present, as there is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.

### FAQs
