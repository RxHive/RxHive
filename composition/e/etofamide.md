# Etofamide
### Generic Name
Etofamide

### Usage
Etofamide is an antiprotozoal medication primarily used to treat intestinal amebiasis, a parasitic infection of the intestines caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  This medication targets the ameba in the intestinal lumen, meaning it works directly within the bowel.  It's not effective against extra-intestinal amebiasis (amebiasis that has spread beyond the intestines).

### Dosage

**Adults:** For intestinal amebiasis, the typical adult dose is 500 mg twice daily (BID) for three days.  The medication is administered orally.

**Children:** For intestinal amebiasis in children, the dosage is typically given as a suspension (100 mg/5 mL). The recommended dose is 10 mL three times daily (TID) for three days, or 15-20 mg/kg/day for three days. Always follow the prescribing healthcare provider's instructions carefully for accurate dosage based on the child's weight and condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dose in these situations.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of etofamide, although the frequency isn't clearly defined in available literature, may include:

* Flatulence (gas)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Vomiting
* Pruritus (itching)

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor or other healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Etofamide is a luminal amebicide, meaning it acts directly within the lumen (the inside space) of the intestines.  Its precise mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it effectively kills *Entamoeba histolytica* parasites in the gut, thereby treating the infection. It doesn't typically penetrate tissues to address amebiasis that has spread outside the intestines.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Etofamide is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to etofamide or any of its components. It's also contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women.
* **Cautions:**  Use with caution in patients with pre-existing cardiac (heart), hepatic (liver), or renal (kidney) diseases.  Close monitoring might be necessary in such cases.
* **Drug Interactions:** Information regarding specific drug interactions with etofamide is limited in readily available literature. Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking to assess potential interactions.
