# Enfortumab Vedotin
### Generic Name
Enfortumab Vedotin

### Usage
Enfortumab vedotin is a type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) used to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.  This means it's used for bladder cancer that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.  Specifically, it's indicated for patients who have already received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy, or those ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy and have received at least one prior line of therapy.  In simpler terms, it's a treatment option for people with advanced bladder cancer whose previous treatments haven't been successful.

### Dosage
Enfortumab vedotin is administered intravenously (IV).  The usual dose for adults with urothelial cancer is 1.25 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 125 mg for patients weighing 100 kg or more) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. This cycle is repeated until the cancer progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like liver function, kidney function, and the severity of side effects.  The drug should be infused over 30 minutes and not administered as a rapid injection.  There is no established dosage for children.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Taste changes (dysgeusia)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Decreased levels of hemoglobin, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (types of blood cells)
* Blurred vision
* Dry eyes

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and diabetic ketoacidosis
* Severe lung inflammation (pneumonitis)
* Severe kidney problems
* Severe infections


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Enfortumab vedotin targets a protein called nectin-4, which is often found on the surface of urothelial cancer cells.  The drug is designed so that the antibody portion binds to nectin-4, allowing it to enter the cancer cell. Once inside, a potent anti-cancer agent (monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE) is released, disrupting the cell's internal structure and leading to its death (apoptosis).  Essentially, it acts like a guided missile, delivering a powerful toxin directly to the cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Enfortumab vedotin can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and for two months after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least three weeks afterward. Men should also use contraception during and for four months after treatment.
* **Liver impairment:** Dose adjustments or avoidance of the drug might be necessary for individuals with moderate to severe liver problems.
* **Drug interactions:** Concomitant use with certain other medications may increase the risk of side effects. Discuss all medications you're taking with your doctor.
* **Other precautions:**  Close monitoring is necessary for various side effects like skin reactions, high blood sugar, lung problems, nerve damage, and eye problems.  Regular blood tests are typically recommended.
