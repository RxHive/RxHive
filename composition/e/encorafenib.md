# Encorafenib
### Generic Name
Encorafenib

### Usage

Encorafenib is a targeted therapy primarily used in the treatment of certain types of cancer.  Its main application is in the management of unresectable or metastatic melanoma (a type of skin cancer) where a specific BRAF V600E or V600K mutation is present. This mutation is identified through an FDA-approved test. In these cases, Encorafenib is usually given in combination with another drug, binimetinib.  

A secondary, but significant, use is in the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (cancer of the large intestine) that also harbors the BRAF V600E mutation (again, confirmed by an FDA-approved test).  For colorectal cancer, Encorafenib is administered after the patient has received prior therapy and is combined with cetuximab.  It's crucial to understand that Encorafenib is *not* indicated for cancers without these specific BRAF mutations; its use in such cases may even be counterproductive.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the type of cancer being treated and is always determined by a healthcare professional.  

**Melanoma (BRAF V600E or V600K mutation):** The typical oral dose is 450 mg once daily, taken in combination with binimetinib. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (BRAF V600E mutation):**  The standard oral dose is 300 mg once daily, given in combination with cetuximab. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity arises.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Encorafenib have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary based on several factors, including liver and kidney function, and the severity of side effects.  Specific guidelines for dose reductions are outlined in the prescribing information and should be followed closely by healthcare professionals.  For example,  elevated liver enzymes may necessitate dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.


### Side Effects

Encorafenib can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin reactions (including palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, or hand-foot skin reaction)
* Changes in blood counts (anemia, neutropenia)
* Liver enzyme elevations


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:

* Severe skin reactions
* Eye inflammation (uveitis)
* Heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation)
* Bleeding (hemorrhage)
* Severe liver damage
* Development of new cancers

If you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Encorafenib is a type of targeted therapy known as a kinase inhibitor. It specifically targets a protein called BRAF, which is abnormally active in certain cancers with BRAF V600 mutations.  BRAF is a key component of a signaling pathway (MAPK pathway) that drives cancer cell growth and division. By blocking the action of mutant BRAF, Encorafenib disrupts this pathway, inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.  When used in combination with other drugs, like binimetinib or cetuximab,  it enhances the anti-cancer effects and may help prevent the development of resistance to the therapy.


### Precautions

* **BRAF Mutation Status:**  It's critical to confirm the presence of the BRAF V600E or V600K mutation before starting Encorafenib.  The drug is not effective for cancers lacking these mutations.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Encorafenib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Consult your healthcare provider about any medications you are currently taking.  Grapefruit juice should also be avoided.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Encorafenib should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney problems. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Encorafenib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for two weeks afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for two weeks after the final dose.
* **Cardiac Effects:** Encorafenib can prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of heart rhythm problems.  This risk is increased in patients taking other drugs that can prolong the QT interval.
* **Increased Cancer Risk:**  There is an increased risk of developing new cancers (both skin and non-skin) while on Encorafenib. Regular monitoring is essential.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Encorafenib with food?** A: Yes, Encorafenib can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If it's less than 12 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store Encorafenib?** A: Store Encorafenib as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Encorafenib?** A: No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they can interact with Encorafenib and increase its concentration in the blood.
* **Q: How long will I be on Encorafenib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and the progression of your disease. This is determined by your oncologist.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  They can advise on managing these symptoms and may adjust your treatment plan.
