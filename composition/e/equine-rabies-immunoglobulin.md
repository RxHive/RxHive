# Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin
### Generic Name
Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG)

### Usage
Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG) is a passive immunotherapy used in the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of rabies.  This means it's given *after* a person has been potentially exposed to the rabies virus, such as through a bite or scratch from a rabid animal.  ERIG provides immediate, temporary protection while the body's own immune system begins to produce antibodies against the rabies virus.  Its primary use is in conjunction with rabies vaccine to significantly reduce the risk of developing rabies.  There are no other notable secondary uses for ERIG; it is solely indicated for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis.

### Dosage
Dosage of ERIG is determined by the healthcare provider based on several factors, including the severity of the exposure (e.g., the location and nature of the bite, the animal's rabies status), the patient's weight, and age.  There is no standard pediatric or adult dosage as it's always tailored to the individual case.  ERIG is administered intramuscularly (IM) at the site furthest from the bite wound.  Intravenous (IV) administration is generally avoided unless IM administration is impossible due to extenuating circumstances, as IV administration may cause adverse reactions.  Precise dosing instructions will always come directly from a medical professional involved in managing the rabies exposure case.  There is no oral form of ERIG.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of ERIG can include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Headache
* Fever
* Muscle aches
* Nausea
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, although rare, include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Serum sickness (a delayed hypersensitivity reaction)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
ERIG contains antibodies against the rabies virus.  These antibodies are derived from horses that have been immunized against rabies. When injected into a person, these pre-formed antibodies immediately bind to and neutralize the rabies virus, preventing it from infecting cells and causing disease.  This provides immediate protection while the person receives the rabies vaccine, which stimulates the body's own immune system to produce long-term immunity against rabies.  The ERIG antibodies provide a temporary passive immunity (lasting weeks), whereas the vaccine provides longer-term active immunity.

### Precautions
* **Allergy to horse proteins:**  Individuals with a known allergy to horse serum or equine products should not receive ERIG.  A thorough allergy history is essential before administration.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Although no specific drug interactions are commonly noted, informing the administering physician of all other medications being taken is crucial to prevent any unforeseen complications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of ERIG during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully weighed against the risk of rabies.  A healthcare professional must assess the risk-benefit ratio.
* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring for allergic reactions is crucial, especially during the first few hours following administration.  The injection site should be observed for any signs of infection.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection from ERIG last?**  A: The protection offered by ERIG is temporary, typically lasting only a few weeks. The rabies vaccine provides long-term protection.

* **Q: Is ERIG a substitute for the rabies vaccine?** A: No, ERIG is used *in conjunction* with the rabies vaccine. It provides immediate protection while the vaccine stimulates the body's own immune response.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially severe ones, to your doctor immediately.

* **Q: How is ERIG stored?** A: ERIG must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated.

* **Q: Is ERIG safe for children?** A: ERIG can be used in children, but the decision to administer it is always made by a healthcare provider based on the individual circumstances.
