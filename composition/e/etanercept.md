# Etanercept

**Generic Name:** Etanercept

**Usage:** Etanercept is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used to treat several autoimmune conditions.  Its primary uses include:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  Reduces signs and symptoms, slows joint damage, and improves physical function. It's often used in combination with methotrexate.
* **Psoriatic arthritis:**  Reduces joint inflammation and improves symptoms.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:**  Reduces pain and inflammation in the spine.
* **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA):**  Treats certain forms in children.
* **Psoriasis:**  Clears skin lesions and improves symptoms.
* **Plaque psoriasis:**  Reduces the severity of skin lesions.
* **Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis:**  Used in children with multiple joint involvement.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, etanercept can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Injection site reactions:**  Redness, swelling, pain, or itching at the injection site.
* **Infections:** Increased risk of infections (bacterial, viral, fungal). This is a significant concern.
* **Upper respiratory infections:**  Common cold, sinus infections, bronchitis.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Injection site reactions:**
* **Serious infections:**  In rare cases, serious infections such as tuberculosis, sepsis, or opportunistic infections can occur.


**Less common but serious side effects include:**

* **Heart failure:**
* **Blood disorders:**  Decreased blood cell counts.
* **Nervous system problems:**  Numbness, tingling, or weakness.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* **Hepatitis:**  Liver inflammation.
* **Lymphoma and other cancers:**  Increased risk, although the absolute risk remains low.  This is a particular concern for patients with pre-existing conditions that predispose them to cancer.


**How it Works:** Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker.  TNF is a protein involved in inflammation.  Etanercept works by binding to TNF, preventing it from interacting with its receptors on cells. This reduces inflammation and improves symptoms of the autoimmune conditions it treats.  It essentially neutralizes a key inflammatory pathway.
