# Eberconazole + Mometasone
### Generic Name
Eberconazole + Mometasone


### Usage
Eberconazole and Mometasone is a combination medication used topically to treat skin conditions involving both fungal infection and inflammation.  The eberconazole component is an antifungal agent, effective against a variety of dermatophytes (fungi that cause skin infections) and yeasts.  Mometasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation, itching, and redness associated with these skin conditions.  This combination is primarily used for conditions like tinea cruris (jock itch), tinea pedis (athlete's foot) and tinea corporis (ringworm) when there's a significant inflammatory component alongside the fungal infection.  It may also be prescribed for other fungal skin infections with inflammation, but always under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
Dosage depends on the specific formulation (cream, ointment, lotion), the affected area, and the severity of the condition.  A doctor will provide specific instructions. Generally, a thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected area twice daily, usually morning and evening.  The application should be gentle, and the area should be cleaned and dried before applying the medication.  There are no established dosages for children or intravenous (IV) administration. This medication is for topical use only; it should not be ingested or injected.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and duration of treatment.  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Itching
* Skin irritation or redness
* Dryness
* Thinning of the skin
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Changes in skin pigmentation

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (such as rash, hives, swelling)
* Skin atrophy (thinning and weakening of the skin)
* Steroid rosacea (redness and pimples)
* Purpura (bruising)
*  Increased risk of secondary infection


If any significant side effects develop, stop using the medication and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Eberconazole works by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  This disruption leads to fungal cell death, effectively treating the fungal infection.  Mometasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation by suppressing the body's inflammatory response. It acts by binding to intracellular receptors, influencing the production of inflammatory mediators.  The combined effect targets both the infection and the associated inflammation, providing comprehensive treatment for inflammatory fungal skin infections.
