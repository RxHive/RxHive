# Elexacaftor + Tezacaftor + Ivacaftor
### Generic Name
Elexacaftor + Tezacaftor + Ivacaftor

### Usage
This triple combination medication (elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor) is specifically indicated for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in their CFTR gene.  If a patient's genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test must be performed to confirm the presence of this specific mutation before initiating treatment.  This medication is a significant advance in CF treatment, targeting a key underlying genetic defect.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** This medication is supplied as two separate products:  elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (orange tablets) in a fixed combination, and ivacaftor (blue tablets) separately.  Dosage instructions involve taking both components.

**Adults (Cystic Fibrosis):**

* Two orange tablets (containing Elexacaftor 100 mg/Tezacaftor 50 mg/Ivacaftor 75 mg per tablet) in the morning and one 150 mg blue Ivacaftor tablet in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart.


**Children (Cystic Fibrosis):**

Dosage is weight and age-dependent.

* **Children aged 6 to under 12 years weighing less than 30 kg:** Two tablets (Elexacaftor 50 mg/Tezacaftor 25 mg/Ivacaftor 37.5 mg per tablet - a lower strength tablet formulation is needed here) in the morning and one 75 mg Ivacaftor tablet in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart.
* **Children aged 6 to under 12 years weighing 30 kg or more, or children 12 years and older:** Two tablets (Elexacaftor 100 mg/Tezacaftor 50 mg/Ivacaftor 75 mg per tablet) in the morning and one 150 mg Ivacaftor tablet in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Severe hepatic impairment contraindicates use.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for mild to moderate renal impairment; however, caution is advised for those with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²).
* **CYP3A Interactions:**  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended, as it significantly reduces Ivacaftor exposure and likely decreases elexacaftor and tezacaftor exposure, compromising effectiveness. Conversely, strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors increase exposure and require dose reduction.  Refer to detailed interaction information for specific adjustments.

**Administration:**  The tablets should be swallowed whole and taken with a meal containing fat. Grapefruit juice should be avoided.  


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Increased indirect serum bilirubin level
* Upper respiratory tract infection


**Less Common, But Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Increased blood pressure
* Acne, eczema, pruritus (itching), skin rash
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Abdominal distension and flatulence
* Urinary tract infections
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, bilirubin)
* Influenza
* Other respiratory infections (pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Elexacaftor and tezacaftor work together to improve the processing and transport of CFTR protein (including the F508del mutant form) to the cell surface. Ivacaftor then enhances the function of the CFTR protein at the cell surface by increasing chloride transport.  The combined effect improves chloride ion movement across cell membranes, addressing the underlying cause of CF symptoms in patients with at least one F508del mutation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any of its components.
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of noncongenital lens opacities (cataracts) and liver function test abnormalities have been reported.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic or severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication interacts extensively with other drugs metabolized through the CYP3A4 pathway or involving P-glycoprotein.  Close monitoring is necessary when co-administered with other medications.  Consult the detailed interaction list provided separately for specific precautions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Data on pregnancy and breastfeeding are limited.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.
