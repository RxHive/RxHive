# Eletriptan
### Generic Name
Eletriptan

### Usage
Eletriptan is a triptan medication specifically used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches in adults, both with and without aura.  It's crucial to understand that eletriptan is *not* a preventative medication for migraines; it's designed to relieve the symptoms of a migraine attack once it has begun. It is also not indicated for the treatment of cluster headaches or other types of headaches.  A proper diagnosis of migraine is necessary before using eletriptan.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical starting dose is 20-40 mg orally, taken as a single dose.  A maximum single dose of 40 mg is recommended. If the headache improves but then returns, a second dose of 20-40 mg may be taken after at least 2 hours have passed, but the total daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.  It's important to note that the safety of treating more than an average of three migraine attacks per month with eletriptan hasn't been fully established.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of eletriptan in children have not been established.  This medication is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For adults with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically necessary. However, eletriptan is not recommended for use in individuals with severe hepatic impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Chills
* Chest pain
* Palpitations
* Nausea
* Dry mouth
* Abdominal pain
* Weakness
* Back pain


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, Post-marketing and/or Case Reports):**  These include, but are not limited to, allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), heart problems (arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, stroke), serious neurological events (seizures), and increased blood pressure.

**Important Note:** If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking eletriptan and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Eletriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist. It works primarily by binding to specific serotonin receptors (5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors) in the brain and blood vessels of the head.  This action helps narrow blood vessels in the brain and reduces the release of substances that trigger pain and inflammation associated with migraine headaches.  By targeting these receptors, eletriptan helps alleviate the pain and other symptoms of a migraine attack.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Eletriptan is contraindicated in individuals with a history or current presence of:

* Hypersensitivity to eletriptan or related compounds
* Coronary artery disease (including angina, myocardial infarction, or silent ischemia) or coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal angina)
* Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or other arrhythmias related to cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders
* Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
* Hemiplegic or basilar migraine
* Peripheral vascular disease
* Ischemic bowel disease
* Uncontrolled hypertension
* Severe hepatic impairment

**Interactions:**  Eletriptan may interact with several other medications, including certain antidepressants (MAO inhibitors), opioid analgesics,  ergot derivatives, and some CYP3A4 inhibitors. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions before taking eletriptan, particularly if you are on other medications.

**Warnings:**  Eletriptan should be used with caution in individuals with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, and in patients who are taking other triptans or ergot medications.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits of eletriptan with their healthcare provider before use.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take eletriptan with other migraine medications?** A: No, avoid taking eletriptan with other triptans, ergotamine-containing medications, or ergot-type medications within a specified timeframe (24 hours for triptans, 72 hours for potent CYP3A4 inhibitors).  Always consult your doctor before combining medications.

* **Q: How should I store eletriptan?** A: Store eletriptan at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Eletriptan is for acute treatment; taking it only when you have a migraine attack.  Missed doses are generally not a concern in this context.

* **Q: Can I drive after taking eletriptan?** A:  Drowsiness is a possible side effect of eletriptan. Avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel drowsy.
