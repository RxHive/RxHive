# Eletriptan

**Generic Name:** Eletriptan

**Usage:**  Eletriptan is a triptan medication used to treat migraine headaches with or without aura in adults. It's taken orally at the first sign of a migraine to relieve headache pain, nausea, and other migraine-associated symptoms.  It is *not* intended for the preventative treatment of migraines.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, eletriptan can cause side effects. Some common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Somnolence (sleepiness):** Feeling tired or drowsy.
* **Weakness:** General feeling of fatigue or lack of strength.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Dry mouth:** Reduced saliva production.
* **Warmth or flushing:** Sensation of warmth or redness in the skin.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Chest pain or tightness:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience this.
* **Heart palpitations:**  Rapid or irregular heartbeat.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These are rare but can be life-threatening; symptoms include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.


**How it Works:** Eletriptan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist.  This means it works by binding to specific serotonin receptors in the brain, constricting blood vessels in the brain and reducing the release of pain-causing substances. This helps to alleviate the pain and other symptoms associated with migraine headaches.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed this vasoconstriction and reduction of inflammatory substances is key to its effectiveness.

* **Q: How often can I take it?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Generally, no more than one dose of eletriptan should be taken within a 24-hour period, and it shouldn't be taken more than twice in a week.
* **Q: Can I take eletriptan with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions are possible, particularly with certain antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs) and ergot-derived migraine medications.
* **Q: Is eletriptan safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  Talk to your doctor.  The safety of eletriptan during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.
* **Q: What should I do if a dose is missed?** A:  Do not take a double dose.  Only take eletriptan when you experience a migraine attack, and follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.
* **Q: What if I don't get relief?** A:  If you don't get relief from your migraine after taking eletriptan, consult your doctor. They may recommend alternative treatments or investigate other potential causes for your headaches.
