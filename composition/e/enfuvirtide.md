# Enfuvirtide
### Generic Name
Enfuvirtide

### Usage
Enfuvirtide is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1 infection.  It's specifically designed for patients who have already received other antiretroviral therapies but still show signs of HIV-1 replication (meaning the virus is still actively reproducing).  Enfuvirtide is *not* typically the first-line treatment for someone newly diagnosed with HIV; it's reserved for those whose disease has become resistant to other drugs.  Its primary function is to inhibit the fusion of the HIV-1 virus with CD4 cells, preventing the virus from entering and infecting them.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The standard adult dose is 90 mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin) twice daily (BID).

**Pediatric Dosage:** For children weighing 11 kg (approximately 24 lbs) or more, the dosage is individualized.  It's often calculated based on weight (2 mg/kg/dose BID), with a maximum single dose of 90 mg.  Alternatively, fixed-dose regimens are available based on weight bands (see details in the provided data).  Always follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions as it is critical for this medication.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are generally needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Fatigue
*   Insomnia
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
*   Injection site infection


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**

*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
*   Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, hypotension)
*   Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
*   Pneumonia
*   Neuropathy (nerve damage)
*   Various other side effects detailed in the original data set, many involving organ systems like the skin, gastrointestinal, and the nervous system.


**Important:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor.  It works by targeting a specific protein (gp41) on the HIV-1 virus. This protein is crucial for the virus to fuse with the CD4 cells (a type of white blood cell) and enter them.  By blocking gp41's function, Enfuvirtide prevents the virus from infecting these cells, thereby slowing down viral replication.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Enfuvirtide is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use of Enfuvirtide is contraindicated with elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.  Careful monitoring is required if used with several other antiretroviral medications. Consult with a doctor or pharmacist for more information regarding drug interactions and safety.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Enfuvirtide is a Category B drug during pregnancy (animal studies have not shown risk, but human data is limited). The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown. However, breastfeeding is generally discouraged for people living with HIV due to the risk of transmission.
*   **Injection Site:** Administer subcutaneously, rotating injection sites to avoid irritation. Avoid areas with skin abnormalities or near major nerves.
*   **Other Precautions:** Close monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions, and other adverse events is essential throughout treatment.
