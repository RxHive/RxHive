# Erythromycin (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Erythromycin (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Erythromycin ophthalmic is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used primarily to treat bacterial infections of the eye's surface.  This includes conditions like conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other superficial ocular infections.  It's also used to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum, a serious eye infection in newborns.  While not a primary indication, it has also seen off-label use in the treatment of trachoma, a chronic eye infection caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis*.

### Dosage

**Superficial Ocular Infections:**

* **Adults and Children:** For both adults and children, the usual dosage is a one-centimeter ribbon of 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment applied to the affected eye(s) up to six times daily. The frequency depends on the severity of the infection.  Your doctor will guide you on the appropriate frequency.

**Ophthalmia Neonatorum (Prophylaxis):**

* **Newborns:**  A one-centimeter ribbon of 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is instilled into each lower conjunctival sac (the pouch where the eye meets the eyelid) immediately after birth.  It's crucial to use a new tube for each infant to maintain sterility. Do not flush the ointment from the eye after application.

**Trachoma (Off-Label Use):**

* **Adults and Children:** The recommended regimen varies and is typically determined by a healthcare professional. It may involve applying a one-centimeter ribbon of 0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment every 12 hours for two months or applying the ointment every 12 hours on day 5 of each month for six months.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Mild burning or stinging sensation upon application.
* Eye redness or irritation.
* Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity) are possible, though uncommon.

Serious side effects are rare but warrant immediate medical attention.  Consult your doctor if you experience any unexpected or severe reactions.

### How it Works

Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the protein synthesis of bacteria.  Specifically, it binds to the bacterial ribosome (the 50s subunit), preventing the bacteria from producing the proteins necessary for their survival and reproduction, effectively killing them. This targeted action helps clear bacterial infections affecting the eye's surface.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Erythromycin ophthalmic is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to erythromycin or any component of the formulation.
* **Contact Lenses:** Patients should avoid wearing contact lenses during treatment.
* **Application:** Avoid contact between the tip of the ointment tube and the eye or surrounding skin to prevent contamination.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While categorized as Pregnancy Category B (low risk), it's essential to consult a doctor before using erythromycin ophthalmic during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. The excretion of erythromycin in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Erythromycin may interact with vitamin K antagonists (like warfarin), potentially increasing their blood levels.  Monitoring is advised if you're taking these medications concurrently.
* **Other Medications:** Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on the infection's severity and response to treatment. Your doctor will determine the appropriate length of therapy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I use this ointment in both eyes if only one is infected?** A: Unless specifically instructed otherwise by your doctor, apply the ointment only to the affected eye(s).

* **Q: Is it safe to use Erythromycin ophthalmic in children?** A: Yes, it is used safely in children, but always under the guidance of a pediatrician or ophthalmologist.
