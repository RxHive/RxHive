# Ethambutol
### Generic Name
Ethambutol

### Usage

Ethambutol is an antitubercular medication primarily used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).  It's crucial to understand that Ethambutol is *always* used in combination with at least one other anti-TB drug. This combination approach is essential to prevent the development of drug-resistant TB strains.  While its primary use is in pulmonary TB, Ethambutol also sees use in treating other mycobacterial infections, although often off-label. These include *Mycobacterium avium* complex (MAC) disease and, less commonly, infections caused by *Mycobacterium kansasii*.  Treatment regimens and dosages vary significantly depending on the specific infection and patient characteristics.  It's vital to consult current tuberculosis treatment guidelines for the most up-to-date recommendations.

### Dosage

Ethambutol dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors such as the patient's weight, age, the specific infection being treated, and the chosen treatment regimen (e.g., once-daily, twice-weekly, or three-times-weekly directly observed therapy [DOT]).  

**Adults:** Dosage for pulmonary TB typically ranges from 15 to 25 mg/kg/day, adjusted based on body weight.  For MAC disease, dosages may differ, often starting at 15 mg/kg daily and adjusted as per the severity and response.  Detailed weight-based recommendations are provided in the product labeling and should be strictly followed.  Maximum daily doses are usually specified to prevent adverse effects.  

**Children:** Pediatric dosages are also weight-based, typically ranging from 15-25 mg/kg/day for active TB treatment.  However, careful monitoring of visual acuity is extremely important in children, as Ethambutol can cause visual disturbances. The decision to use Ethambutol in children under 13 years of age requires careful consideration due to the difficulty in assessing visual acuity in this age group.


**Administration:** Ethambutol is usually administered orally as a tablet.  It can be taken with or without food, but if gastrointestinal distress occurs, taking it with food is recommended.

**Important Note:**  The information provided here is a summary.  Precise dosing instructions should always come directly from a healthcare professional familiar with the patient's specific situation and current treatment guidelines.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve, leading to vision problems, including color blindness and decreased visual acuityâ€”this is potentially irreversible)
* Peripheral neuritis (nerve inflammation in the extremities)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from mild rashes to severe systemic reactions)


If any adverse effects occur, especially visual disturbances, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Ethambutol is a bacteriostatic drug, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria rather than killing them outright. It works by interfering with the synthesis of mycobacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it inhibits arabinosyl transferase, an enzyme essential for the formation of arabinogalactan, a crucial component of the mycobacterial cell wall.  By disrupting cell wall synthesis, Ethambutol prevents the bacteria from growing and reproducing.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Ethambutol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with kidney or liver disease.
* **Visual Impairment:**  Regular monitoring of visual acuity is essential, particularly at higher doses or in prolonged treatment, to detect potential optic neuritis early. Patients should report any changes in vision immediately.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ethambutol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C by the FDA, indicating potential risks to the fetus.  It's excreted in breast milk, requiring careful monitoring of the nursing infant.  The decision to use Ethambutol during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits against the potential risks.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ethambutol can interact with other medications.  It's important to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Alcohol:**  Alcohol consumption should be avoided or minimized during Ethambutol therapy.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ethambutol with food?** A:  Yes, you can take Ethambutol with or without food. However, if it causes gastrointestinal upset, taking it with food may help.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Ethambutol?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the specific infection and treatment regimen. It typically ranges from several months to a year or more.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider for guidance.  Do not double the next dose.

* **Q: How should I store Ethambutol?** A:  Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Ethambutol if I feel better?** A: No.  Complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed, even if you feel better, to prevent relapse and the development of drug resistance.  Premature discontinuation significantly increases the risk of treatment failure.
