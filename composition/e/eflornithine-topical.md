# Eflornithine (Topical)
### Generic Name
Eflornithine (Topical)

### Usage
Eflornithine topical cream is primarily used to reduce unwanted facial hair growth in women.  This includes hair on the face and areas under the chin. It's important to note that eflornithine doesn't permanently remove hair; rather, it slows down the growth rate.  Therefore, continued use is needed to maintain results, and hair growth will likely resume after discontinuation.

### Dosage
**Facial Hair Reduction (Females):**

* **Cream (13.9%):**  Apply a thin layer to affected areas of the face and under the chin twice daily (BID), ensuring at least 8 hours separate each application.  

**Pediatric Use (Females):**

* For females aged 12 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults. Eflornithine topical cream is not approved for use in children younger than 12 years old.

**Important Administration Guidelines:**

* Apply the cream at least 5 minutes after hair removal (e.g., shaving, waxing).
* Do not wash the treated area for at least 4 hours after application.
* Makeup and sunscreen can be applied once the cream is dry.
* If a dose is missed, apply as soon as possible, but wait at least 8 hours before the next application.

### How it Works
Eflornithine inhibits an enzyme called ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). This enzyme plays a crucial role in cell division and growth, particularly in hair follicles. By inhibiting ODC, eflornithine slows down the rate of hair growth, resulting in reduced hair growth over time.

### Precautions

* **Contraindication:**  Eflornithine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to eflornithine or any components of the cream formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Eflornithine is categorized as pregnancy category C. This means that its effects on a developing fetus are not fully understood.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised when using this medication during breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:**  Interactions with other medications are not commonly reported, but itâ€™s essential to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking. 
* **Hypersensitivity:** Be aware of the increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Discontinue use and seek medical attention if any allergic symptoms occur.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**

A: It may take several weeks to notice a significant reduction in hair growth.  Continue using the medication as directed, even if you don't see immediate results.  If no improvement is seen after 6 months, consult your doctor.

**Q: Is hair removal still necessary?**

A: Yes, you'll still need to use hair removal methods (shaving, waxing, etc.) to remove existing hair. Eflornithine slows hair regrowth, but it doesn't remove existing hair.

**Q: Is the effect permanent?**

A: No, the effects of eflornithine are not permanent. Hair growth will likely resume after you stop using the cream.


**Q: How should I store eflornithine cream?**

A: Store the cream at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Apply the missed dose as soon as possible.  However, make sure to wait at least 8 hours before your next scheduled application.
