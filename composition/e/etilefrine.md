# Etilefrine
### Generic Name
Etilefrine

### Usage
Etilefrine is primarily used to treat orthostatic hypotension. This is a condition where blood pressure drops significantly when a person stands up from a lying or sitting position, leading to dizziness or fainting.  Etilefrine is indicated for orthostatic hypotension stemming from neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine, or metabolic causes.  It's crucial to understand that etilefrine doesn't address the underlying cause of the hypotension; it only manages the symptoms.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Symptomatic or orthostatic hypotension:**
    * Oral solution (7.5 mg/mL): 5-10 mg (10-20 drops) three times a day (TID).
    * Oral tablet: 5-10 mg TID.
    * Oral long-acting capsule: 25 mg once daily (OD) or twice daily (BID).

**Children:**

Dosage for children varies significantly depending on age:

* **Infants (<2 years):** Oral solution (7.5 mg/mL): 1-2.5 mg TID, administered before meals.
* **Children (2-6 years):** Oral solution (7.5 mg/mL) or tablet: 2.5-5 mg TID, administered before meals.
* **Children (>6 years):**  Dosage is similar to adults, with the long-acting capsule possibly starting at 25 mg OD or BID; the morning dose might be increased to 50 mg if necessary.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with severe renal insufficiency.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not specified in available data) may include:

* Central nervous system (CNS) effects
* Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances
* Epigastric pain
* Cardiovascular disorders
* Difficulty urinating (with potential urinary retention)
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
* Sweating
* Excessive salivation (hypersalivation)
* Weakness
* Tremors
* Cold extremities
* Low potassium (hypokalemia)
* Palpitations
* Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)
* Arrhythmias
* Gangrene (rare but serious)

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Etilefrine is a sympathomimetic amine.  It directly stimulates both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the body.  Stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), while stimulating beta-adrenergic receptors increases the heart's contractility and heart rate. These combined effects lead to an increase in blood pressure, counteracting the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Etilefrine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity to sulfites or parabens (for oral solution)
* Overactive thyroid (thyrotoxicosis)
* Pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the adrenal gland)
* Narrow-angle glaucoma
* Enlarged prostate with urinary retention
* Breastfeeding
* Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)
* Hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis)
* High blood pressure (hypertension)
* Coronary artery disease
* Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
* Cardiac valve stenosis
* Hypotension with upright hypertensive reactions
* First trimester of pregnancy


**Use with Caution:** Etilefrine should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Diabetes mellitus
* High blood calcium (hypercalcemia)
* Severe renal insufficiency
* Cor pulmonale (right-sided heart failure)
* Low potassium (hypokalemia)
* Pregnancy (second and third trimesters)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Coronary artery disease


**Drug Interactions:** Etilefrine's effects can be altered by other medications.  Important interactions include increased effects with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amantadine, isoniazid, and theophylline; reduced effects with dihydralazine, lithium salts, beta-blockers, and quinidine; and altered effects on guanethidine, sulfonylurea antidiabetics, metformin, and bretylium.  Concurrent use with TCAs may increase the risk of hypertension and arrhythmias.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take etilefrine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting etilefrine.  Many drug interactions are possible.
