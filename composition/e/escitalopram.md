# Escitalopram
### Generic Name
Escitalopram

### Usage
Escitalopram is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults and adolescents aged 12-17.  It's also approved for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults.  Importantly,  it's frequently used off-label for other conditions, including  panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.  However,  the efficacy and safety for these off-label uses should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical starting dose for MDD and GAD is 10mg once daily. This can be increased to a maximum of 20mg daily after at least one week, depending on individual response and tolerability.  Dosage adjustments for off-label uses vary and are typically individualized by a doctor, often starting at a lower dose (e.g., 5mg) and gradually increasing.  

**Children and Adolescents:**  Dosage for adolescents (12-17 years) with MDD usually starts at 10mg once daily, potentially increasing to 20mg.  Prescribing escitalopram for children younger than 12 is not generally recommended.  Use in children and adolescents requires careful monitoring by a healthcare provider.  Specific dosages for off-label use in this age group are not standardized and must be determined under strict medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) or severe renal (kidney) impairment.  Older adults may also require a lower starting dose.  It's crucial to consult a doctor for appropriate dosage adjustments based on individual health conditions.


**Forms:** Escitalopram is typically available as oral tablets.

**Administration:**  It's usually taken once daily, either in the morning or evening, with or without food.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Ejaculatory disorders (in men)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by symptoms like high fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, and rapid heart rate)
* QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (particularly in young adults)
* Mania or hypomania (in individuals with bipolar disorder)
* Bleeding problems (especially when taken with other medications that increase bleeding risk)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood)


If any adverse effects occur, it is essential to seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works

Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  It works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  Low levels of serotonin are often implicated in depression and anxiety.  By preventing the reuptake of serotonin, escitalopram helps to boost serotonin activity in the brain, thereby improving mood and reducing anxiety symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Escitalopram should not be used concurrently with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of stopping an MAOI. It's also contraindicated in patients with known QT interval prolongation or congenital long QT syndrome and those hypersensitive to escitalopram or citalopram.

* **Interactions:**  Escitalopram can interact with various medications, including other antidepressants, MAOIs, certain pain relievers (NSAIDs), anticoagulants, and drugs that prolong the QT interval.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Escitalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's excreted in breast milk, and the decision to use it while breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.

* **Elderly and Children:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients and adolescents, and use in young children is generally not recommended.

* **Suicidal Thoughts:**  Individuals starting escitalopram, particularly young adults, should be closely monitored for suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

* **Withdrawal:** Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.  The dosage should be gradually reduced under medical supervision to minimize withdrawal symptoms.
