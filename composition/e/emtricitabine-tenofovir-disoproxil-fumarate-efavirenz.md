# Emtricitabine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + Efavirenz

**Generic Name:** Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/Efavirenz

**Usage:**

This combination drug is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children weighing at least 35 kg (approximately 77 lbs).  It's a complete antiretroviral regimen (meaning it contains all three classes of drugs needed) and is typically used for initial treatment of HIV.  It's *not* a cure for HIV, but it significantly reduces the viral load, improves CD4 cell counts (immune cells), and helps prevent the progression of HIV to AIDS.  It should be used under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.  The specific dosage depends on the individual's weight and age.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Some common side effects include:

* **Nausea:**  Often resolves with continued use.
* **Vomiting:** Can be managed with adjustments to dosing or medications to control nausea.
* **Diarrhea:** Can lead to dehydration; seek medical advice if severe.
* **Headache:** Often mild and can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers.
* **Fatigue:**  Can impact daily activities; rest is important.
* **Dizziness:** Can affect coordination and driving ability.
* **Rash:** Can range from mild to severe; severe rashes require immediate medical attention.
* **Depression:** Seek immediate medical help if experiencing suicidal thoughts or ideation.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Abnormal dreams:** Vivid or disturbing dreams.
* **Changes in body fat distribution:** This can lead to lipoatrophy (loss of fat under the skin) or lipohypertrophy (accumulation of fat in certain areas).
* **Kidney problems (with tenofovir):** Regular blood tests to monitor kidney function are crucial.
* **Bone loss (with tenofovir):**  Regular monitoring is necessary, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation might be considered.
* **Liver problems (with efavirenz):**  Liver function tests are usually monitored.
* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare but serious skin reaction):** Requires immediate medical attention.


This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for complete information and to report any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

This combination drug works by targeting different stages of the HIV life cycle:

* **Emtricitabine and Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate:** These are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). They interfere with the enzyme reverse transcriptase, preventing HIV from replicating its genetic material.

* **Efavirenz:** This is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  It binds to a different site on the reverse transcriptase enzyme, inhibiting its function and preventing viral replication in a different way than the NRTIs.

By combining these three drugs with different mechanisms of action, the medication reduces the risk of HIV developing resistance.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Consult your doctor.  Alcohol can interact with some medications and worsen side effects.
* **Can I take other medications with this?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal) you are taking.  Interactions are possible.
* **How long will I need to take this medication?**  HIV treatment is usually lifelong.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Consult the patient information leaflet or your doctor for instructions on missed doses. Generally, take the missed dose as soon as possible unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double up on doses.
* **What are the long-term effects of this medication?**  Long-term effects can include those listed in the side effects section, as well as potential metabolic changes.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is important.
* **Is this medication safe during pregnancy?**  Discuss this with your doctor.  Special considerations and monitoring are necessary during pregnancy.
* **Can I get this medication at a low cost?**  Many programs exist to help individuals access affordable medications for HIV.  Your doctor or a local health department can provide information about these programs.
