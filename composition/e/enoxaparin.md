# Enoxaparin
### Generic Name
Enoxaparin

### Usage

Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) primarily used to prevent and treat blood clots (thromboembolism).  Its main applications include:

* **Treatment of blood clots:** Enoxaparin effectively treats deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), serious conditions where blood clots form in the deep veins of the legs or in the lungs, respectively.  It's also used to treat blood clots associated with unstable angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack).

* **Prevention of blood clots:**  Enoxaparin is widely used to prevent blood clots from forming, particularly after certain surgeries (hip or knee replacement, abdominal surgery) and in hospitalized patients with limited mobility who are at high risk of developing blood clots. It can also be used for the prevention of blood clots in patients with certain cancers.


While the above represent the primary and most common uses,  off-label uses exist, including  treatment of superficial vein thrombosis, bridging anticoagulation in patients with mechanical heart valves, and anticoagulation of hemodialysis circuits.  These off-label uses should only be considered under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional and based on individual patient needs and risk assessments.

### Dosage

Enoxaparin dosage is highly variable and depends on factors such as the patient's weight, age, specific condition being treated (prophylaxis vs. treatment), and renal function.  **It is crucial to follow the precise instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  The following information is for general understanding only and should not replace individualized medical advice.  Dosage is often expressed in milligrams (mg) or units of anti-factor Xa activity.  Note that 1 mg of Enoxaparin is approximately equal to 100 units of anti-factor Xa activity.

**Adult Dosages (Examples - NOT a comprehensive list):**

* **Treatment of DVT/PE (Inpatient):**  Typically 1 mg/kg every 12 hours or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously (SC).
* **Treatment of DVT/PE (Outpatient - select low risk patients):**  1 mg/kg every 12 hours
* **Prophylaxis after surgery (hip/knee replacement):**  Often 40 mg once daily or 30 mg twice daily SC, starting pre-operatively or post-operatively.
* **Prophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients:** 40 mg once daily SC.

**Pediatric Dosages (Examples - NOT a comprehensive list):**

Pediatric dosing varies significantly based on age and weight.  Precise instructions from a physician are paramount.

**Administration:**  Enoxaparin is usually administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  Intravenous (IV) administration is sometimes used, especially in acute settings like heart attack treatment.  Always follow instructions for the specific dosage form provided.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Bleeding (at the injection site or internally)
* Bruising
* Pain at the injection site
* Nausea
* Anemia


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) - a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.
* Spinal or epidural hematoma (bleeding around the spinal cord), particularly if neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture has been performed.


If you experience any concerning side effects, especially unusual bleeding, bruising, or neurological symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Enoxaparin works by interfering with the blood clotting process.  It enhances the activity of antithrombin III, a natural protein that inhibits several clotting factors, primarily factor Xa and, to a lesser extent, factor IIa (thrombin).  By inhibiting these factors, enoxaparin prevents the formation of blood clots and helps to break down existing clots.

### Precautions

* **Renal impairment:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with reduced kidney function.
* **Hepatic impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with liver disease.
* **Bleeding disorders:** Enoxaparin is contraindicated in patients with active major bleeding or certain bleeding disorders.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Enoxaparin is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but the risks and benefits should be carefully weighed. Consult a doctor for advice. Use of multiple dose vials with benzyl alcohol should be avoided in pregnant women.
* **Interactions with other drugs:** Enoxaparin can interact with numerous medications, including other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, and NSAIDs.  Inform your doctor of all medications, herbal remedies, and supplements you are taking.
* **Spinal/Epidural anesthesia:** Increased risk of spinal or epidural hematoma.  Discuss this risk with your doctor before undergoing any neuraxial procedures.
* **Obesity:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for obese patients.


### FAQs

* **How long do I need to take Enoxaparin?** The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the individual patient. Your doctor will determine the appropriate length of therapy.
* **How should I store Enoxaparin?** Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from heat and light.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for instructions. Do not double up on doses.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Enoxaparin?**  Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of bleeding.  Moderate your alcohol intake or avoid it entirely while taking Enoxaparin.  Consult your doctor.
* **What are the signs of a serious reaction?** Seek immediate medical help if you experience severe bleeding, unusual bruising, shortness of breath, chest pain, or neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, tingling).
