# Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel

**Generic Name:** Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel

**Usage:**  Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel is a combination birth control pill used to prevent pregnancy. It may also be used to treat acne, regulate menstrual cycles, and reduce menstrual cramps.  It's crucial to note that this is a prescription medication, and usage should be strictly according to a doctor's instructions.  Different formulations exist with varying doses and schedules (e.g., 21-day packs, 28-day packs with placebo pills).

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary greatly from person to person and may include:

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, weight changes (gain or loss), mood changes (including depression), headaches, bloating, changes in menstrual bleeding (spotting, breakthrough bleeding, amenorrhea), decreased libido.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, gallbladder disease, liver tumors (rare), increased risk of cervical cancer (although current research suggests this risk is minimal with modern formulations).
* **Rare but Serious:**  Jaundice, allergic reactions.


**How it Works:** This combination pill works primarily by preventing ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary).  Ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen) suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), preventing the development and release of a mature egg. Levonorgestrel (a progestin) thickens the cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg and also thins the uterine lining, making it less hospitable for implantation.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this pill 100% effective?** A: No birth control method is 100% effective.  Typical use effectiveness rates are around 91%, while perfect use effectiveness is higher (around 99%).  User error, such as missed pills, significantly impacts effectiveness.

* **Q: When should I start taking the pill?** A: Your doctor will provide specific instructions, but generally, the first pill is taken on the first day of your menstrual cycle.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a pill?** A: Follow the instructions provided with your specific brand of pill or contact your doctor immediately.  Missing pills can reduce the effectiveness of the medication.

* **Q: Can I take this pill if I smoke?** A: Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious side effects, such as blood clots, with combined oral contraceptives.  Doctors often advise against using combined oral contraceptives, including ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel, if you smoke, especially if you're over 35.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience serious side effects?** A: Stop taking the pill immediately and seek medical attention.

* **Q:  Can I use this pill if I have certain health conditions?** A:  This pill is not suitable for everyone.  You must discuss your medical history (including conditions like blood clots, liver disease, breast cancer, migraines with aura, etc.) with your doctor before starting this medication.
