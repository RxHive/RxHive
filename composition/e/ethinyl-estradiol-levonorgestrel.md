# Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel
### Generic Name
Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel

### Usage
Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel is a combination hormonal contraceptive, primarily used for birth control.  It works by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening the cervical mucus to hinder sperm from reaching the egg, and altering the uterine lining to make implantation of a fertilized egg less likely.  While its primary use is contraception, some formulations might be prescribed off-label to manage certain menstrual irregularities, such as heavy bleeding or painful periods (dysmenorrhea), though this should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.  It's important to note that this medication does *not* protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).


### Dosage
Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific formulation (brand name and the amount of each hormone).  The medication comes in various forms, most commonly oral tablets taken daily.  Dosage instructions are always provided with the prescription and should be followed meticulously.  **Never alter the dosage without consulting your doctor.**

* **Oral:**  The typical regimen involves taking one tablet daily, at the same time each day, for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break during which withdrawal bleeding usually occurs.  Some formulations are 28-day packs, including placebo pills for the 7-day break.  Again, follow the instructions precisely as prescribed.
* **IV Administration:** There is no IV form of Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel.  This medication is always administered orally.

Dosage adjustments are not typically made based on age or weight for adult women. However, this medication is not appropriate for children or adolescents who have not reached menarche (their first menstrual period).  The suitability for use in older women needs individual assessment by a physician.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Headache, nausea, breast tenderness, weight changes, mood changes (including depression), bloating, spotting or breakthrough bleeding, changes in libido.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, liver problems, gallbladder disease, increased risk of certain cancers (cervical, breast), jaundice.


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.  Even seemingly minor side effects warrant a discussion with your doctor, especially if they persist or worsen.


### How it Works
Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen, and levonorgestrel is a synthetic progestin.  Together, they mimic the hormonal changes that occur during the menstrual cycle.  By suppressing the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, ovulation is prevented.  The progestin component thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to penetrate, and alters the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, pregnancy, breastfeeding (although some formulations might be considered postpartum), or certain types of migraine headaches.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Numerous medications can interact with Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel, including some antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and certain herbal supplements.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Specific Warnings:**  Smokers, especially those over 35 years old, face an increased risk of serious cardiovascular side effects.  This medication should be used with caution in women with a family history of blood clots or certain cancers.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid this medication unless specifically instructed otherwise by a healthcare provider.
