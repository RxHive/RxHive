# Epalrestat
### Generic Name
Epalrestat

### Usage
Epalrestat is primarily used to treat diabetic neuropathy, a type of nerve damage that often occurs in people with diabetes.  This nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and feet. Epalrestat works by inhibiting the enzyme aldose reductase, which helps to prevent the buildup of sorbitol in nerve cells.  This buildup of sorbitol is believed to contribute to the development of diabetic neuropathy.  Currently, it is not indicated for other conditions.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for diabetic neuropathy is 50 mg taken orally three times a day (TID).  This is generally taken before meals.  There are currently no specific dosage adjustments recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, though caution is advised in these patient populations.  Epalrestat is not approved for use in children, and its use during pregnancy and lactation is generally not recommended except in life-threatening situations where the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  The medication is available in tablet form.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Epalrestat can include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* High blood pressure
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash or redness (including blistering)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Kidney dysfunction
* Edema (swelling)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Epalrestat works by inhibiting the enzyme aldose reductase.  When blood sugar levels are high (as in diabetes), glucose is converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase.  Sorbitol accumulates in cells, causing osmotic stress which is thought to damage nerves and contribute to diabetic neuropathy. By blocking this conversion, Epalrestat helps prevent the accumulation of sorbitol and thus reduces the nerve damage.  It's important to note that epalrestat does *not* affect blood glucose levels directly.

### Precautions
Epalrestat is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to epalrestat or any of its components.  Caution is advised in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  The drug is generally not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Patients should avoid operating heavy machinery or driving while taking this medication due to the potential for drowsiness or dizziness.  Patients should be aware that their urine may turn a yellow-brown or reddish color; this is a harmless effect of the medication itself.
