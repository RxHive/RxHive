# Eflornithine
### Generic Name
Eflornithine

### Usage
Eflornithine is primarily used to treat West African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), specifically infections caused by *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense*.  It's crucial to note that eflornithine is effective against sleeping sickness only when the infection has spread to the central nervous system (CNS) or when CNS involvement is suspected.  The drug is often administered in combination with other medications.  While it has shown some activity against other parasitic infections, these are not approved uses.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  For treating West African trypanosomiasis with confirmed or suspected CNS involvement, eflornithine is typically given intravenously (IV).  Dosage varies depending on the treatment approach:

* **Combination Therapy (with nifurtimox):**  200 mg/kg per dose administered every 12 hours for 7 days. This combination therapy is the currently preferred approach according to WHO guidelines (2019).
* **Monotherapy (alternative):**  100 mg/kg per dose given every 6 hours for 14 days. This is used less frequently than combination therapy.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of eflornithine in children are not fully established.  Dosage is determined by weight and age and is usually given intravenously.

* **Combination Therapy (NECT regimen with nifurtimox):** For children and adolescents, the recommended dosage is 200 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours for 7 days. This is preferred over monotherapy.
* **Monotherapy:**  For children under 12 years, the dosage is 150 mg/kg per dose every 6 hours for 14 days.  For children 12 years and older and adolescents, the dosage is 100 mg/kg per dose every 6 hours for 14 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are explicitly mentioned in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, it's crucial to exercise caution and potentially adjust the dosage, especially in patients with renal impairment, as eflornithine excretion is reduced in such cases.  A physician should carefully consider the patient's overall health and organ function before determining the appropriate dose.  

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Injection site reactions

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Liver abnormalities
* Blood cell abnormalities (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia)

If any adverse effects occur, immediate consultation with a healthcare provider is necessary.

### How it Works

Eflornithine is an antiprotozoal drug that works by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a crucial enzyme involved in the production of polyamines.  Polyamines are essential for cell growth and division. By inhibiting ODC, eflornithine depletes the cells of polyamines, thus slowing or stopping the growth and replication of the *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense* parasite, thereby treating the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Eflornithine should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with a history of seizures or those with myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression) should be closely monitored while taking eflornithine.
* **Use with Caution:** Eflornithine should be used cautiously in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Eflornithine is classified as Category C during pregnancy. Its use during pregnancy should be avoided unless the potential benefits significantly outweigh the risks to the fetus.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, but breastfeeding may continue during treatment for West African trypanosomiasis.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is eflornithine administered?** A:  Eflornithine is administered intravenously (IV) via infusion. It should not be given intramuscularly (IM).

* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the treatment regimen (combination therapy or monotherapy) and is determined by the healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor immediately if you miss a dose to determine the best course of action.

* **Q: How should eflornithine be stored?** A: Follow your healthcare provider's instructions and the storage information on the medication packaging.  Typically, medications should be stored at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking eflornithine?** A:  No specific dietary restrictions are usually associated with eflornithine treatment, but maintaining a healthy diet is always recommended.
