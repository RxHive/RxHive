# Eflornithine

**Generic Name:** Eflornithine

**Usage:**

Eflornithine is primarily used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), a parasitic disease transmitted by the tsetse fly.  It's typically used in combination with other medications, depending on the stage of the disease.  It is also used off-label to treat hirsutism (excessive hair growth) in women, particularly in cases where other treatments have been ineffective or unsuitable.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Skin rash

More serious, though less common, side effects may include:

* Seizures
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
* Bone marrow suppression (rare)
* Allergic reactions

It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

In the case of sleeping sickness, eflornithine inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme essential for the growth and reproduction of the *Trypanosoma brucei* parasite responsible for the disease. By inhibiting this enzyme, eflornithine effectively slows or stops the parasite's replication.

For hirsutism, the exact mechanism isn't fully understood but it's believed to reduce hair growth by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, which plays a role in hair follicle growth.


**FAQs:**

* **How is eflornithine administered?**  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) for sleeping sickness, and it is given as a topical cream for hirsutism.  Dosage and administration method will be determined by a physician based on individual needs and condition.

* **What are the potential drug interactions?**  Eflornithine may interact with other medications.  It is essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting eflornithine treatment to avoid potential interactions.

Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before starting treatment.
