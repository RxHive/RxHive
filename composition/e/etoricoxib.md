# Etoricoxib
### Generic Name
Etoricoxib

### Usage
Etoricoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor, a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  It's primarily used to relieve the pain and inflammation associated with various conditions. Its main applications include:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints. Etoricoxib helps reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.
* **Osteoarthritis:**  A degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown. Etoricoxib manages pain and improves joint function.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** A form of inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine.  Etoricoxib reduces back pain and stiffness.
* **Acute gouty arthritis:**  Characterized by sudden, severe joint pain and inflammation, often in the big toe. Etoricoxib provides rapid pain relief during acute gout attacks.
* **Acute pain:** Etoricoxib can effectively manage short-term pain from various sources, such as dental procedures, musculoskeletal injuries, and post-surgical pain.  It's typically used for a limited duration in these cases.
* **Chronic pain:** In some cases, etoricoxib may be used for long-term management of chronic pain, but this should be under close medical supervision.
* **Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps):** Etoricoxib can alleviate pain associated with menstrual periods.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.  The following are general guidelines:

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis & Ankylosing Spondylitis:** 60-90 mg once daily.  Maximum daily dose: 90 mg.
* **Osteoarthritis:** 30-60 mg once daily. Maximum daily dose: 60 mg.
* **Acute Gouty Arthritis:** 120 mg once daily for up to 8 days.
* **Acute Pain (e.g., post-surgical, dental):** 90-120 mg once daily for a limited duration (typically 3-8 days, depending on the specific condition and physician's recommendation).
* **Chronic Pain:** 60 mg once daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Etoricoxib is generally not recommended for children under 16 years of age.  For adolescents 16 years and older, the dosage may be similar to adults, but careful consideration of weight and response is necessary.  A physician will determine the appropriate dosage.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  Individuals with mild to moderate liver impairment should receive reduced doses. Etoricoxib is contraindicated in patients with severe liver or kidney impairment.  Always consult a healthcare provider before adjusting dosages.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Swelling (edema)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**  These are less frequent but can be severe.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Heart attack
* Stroke
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) - rare but life-threatening skin reactions.


This is not an exhaustive list.  Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor.

### How it Works

Etoricoxib works by selectively inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By blocking COX-2, etoricoxib reduces the production of these substances, thus alleviating pain and inflammation.  Unlike some older NSAIDs, etoricoxib preferentially targets COX-2, potentially minimizing the risk of gastrointestinal side effects associated with COX-1 inhibition.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Etoricoxib is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to etoricoxib or other NSAIDs, severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcers, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, or pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Etoricoxib can interact with several other medications, including other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and some diuretics.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Etoricoxib is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, and careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with cardiovascular or renal diseases:** The risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke) is increased in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, and etoricoxib should be used with caution or not at all in these individuals. Close monitoring of kidney function is also necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take etoricoxib with alcohol?**  A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking etoricoxib, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding.
* **Q: How should I store etoricoxib?** A: Store etoricoxib at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking etoricoxib suddenly?** A:  It's best to follow your doctor's instructions on how to discontinue etoricoxib.  Sudden cessation might not always be advisable.
* **Q: Is etoricoxib addictive?** A: Etoricoxib is not considered an addictive drug, but it should only be used as directed by your physician.
