# Ethyl morphine
### Generic Name
Ethylmorphine

### Usage
Ethylmorphine is primarily used as a cough suppressant.  Its action is similar to codeine, though it's less potent. While it possesses analgesic (pain-relieving) and antidiarrheal properties, these are rarely its primary reason for prescription due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives. Historically, it was also used in eye drops as a lymphagogue (to stimulate lymph flow), but this practice is largely discontinued.  It's important to note that due to concerns about its potential for abuse and the availability of safer alternatives, ethylmorphine preparations are becoming increasingly rare in many markets.

### Dosage
Dosage of ethylmorphine varies depending on the specific formulation (which is now limited), the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.  Precise dosage information should always be obtained from a physician or pharmacist and the product labeling.  There are no standardized pediatric guidelines readily available due to the medication's limited use.  Adult dosages, when prescribed in the past, were generally lower than equivalent codeine dosages due to ethylmorphine's greater potency. It's crucial to understand that due to its declining use, finding current prescribing information may be difficult.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of ethylmorphine may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Lightheadedness

Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Respiratory depression (slowed or difficult breathing) â€“ this is particularly dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.
* Dependence (with prolonged use)
* Addiction (with prolonged use)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ethylmorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid that is metabolized in the liver to morphine.  Morphine then binds to mu-opioid receptors in the brain and throughout the body. This binding alters pain perception and reduces the cough reflex.  The antidiarrheal effect is likely also linked to its action on opioid receptors within the gastrointestinal tract, though this is not the primary route of action.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ethylmorphine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or other opioids.  It should also be avoided in individuals with severe respiratory depression, certain gastrointestinal conditions, or those with a history of substance abuse.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ethylmorphine can interact with other central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids), increasing the risk of drowsiness and respiratory depression.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of ethylmorphine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally discouraged due to the potential risks to the fetus or infant.  Consult a healthcare professional before using this medication if pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Elderly and Children:**  Ethylmorphine should be used with caution in elderly patients and children due to their increased sensitivity to opioid side effects.
* **Other Cautions:**  Avoid operating machinery or driving while taking ethylmorphine due to the potential for drowsiness.  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.


### FAQs
* **Q: Is ethylmorphine addictive?** A: Yes, like other opioids, ethylmorphine has the potential for addiction with prolonged use.
* **Q: Can I take ethylmorphine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as there is a potential for dangerous interactions.
* **Q: How should I store ethylmorphine?** A:  Storage instructions will vary based on the formulation, but generally, it should be kept in a cool, dry place away from children. (This information is very difficult to obtain with the limited availability of this medication.)
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Consult your physician or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses. (This again requires the availability of this medication.)
* **Q: Why is ethylmorphine becoming less available?** A: Due to safety concerns and the availability of safer, more effective alternatives for cough suppression and pain management, ethylmorphine's use has significantly decreased, and it's becoming less common in many markets.
