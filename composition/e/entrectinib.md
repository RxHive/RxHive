# Entrectinib
### Generic Name
Entrectinib

### Usage
Entrectinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat certain types of solid tumors and metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Its main application is in adult and pediatric patients (aged 12 and older) with solid tumors harboring a neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusion.  These NTRK fusions are genetic abnormalities that drive tumor growth.  Entrectinib is used when the tumor is metastatic (spread to other parts of the body), or if surgical removal would cause significant harm, or if the cancer has progressed after other treatments or lacks satisfactory alternatives.  Importantly, the presence of an NTRK gene fusion must be confirmed before using Entrectinib for solid tumor treatment.

Additionally, Entrectinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors are ROS1-positive. This means their cancer cells have a rearrangement in the ROS1 gene, another genetic abnormality driving tumor growth.  Again, the ROS1 rearrangement must be confirmed before initiating treatment.


### Dosage

**Adults (Solid tumors with NTRK gene fusion; metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC):** The usual oral dose is 600 mg once daily until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Pediatric Patients (Solid tumors with NTRK gene fusion, ≥12 years old):** The oral dose is determined by body surface area (BSA):

* BSA 0.91–1.1 m²: 400 mg once daily
* BSA 1.11–1.5 m²: 500 mg once daily
* BSA >1.5 m²: 600 mg once daily

Treatment continues until disease progression or intolerable side effects develop.  Dosage adjustments are necessary in cases of certain side effects or hepatic impairment;  consult the prescribing information for specific guidelines.  The medication is administered orally and capsules should be swallowed whole.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Numbness or tingling (dysesthesia)
* Cognitive impairment
* Headache
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Sleep disorders
* Edema (swelling)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Skin rash
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Anemia
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels)
*  Visual disturbances

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Heart failure
* QT interval prolongation (on electrocardiogram)
* Serious central nervous system (CNS) effects (confusion, hallucinations, etc.)
* Severe liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
* Serious allergic reactions


If any side effects occur, especially if severe, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Entrectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of specific enzymes, namely TRKA, TRKB, TRKC (all implicated in NTRK gene fusions), ROS1, and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) These enzymes are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and division. By inhibiting these enzymes, Entrectinib interferes with the uncontrolled growth and spread of cancer cells carrying the specific gene fusions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** Entrectinib is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Entrectinib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system and those affecting the QT interval on an electrocardiogram.  Consult a healthcare provider about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Entrectinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for a specified period afterward.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for a specific time after the last dose.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **Cardiac Effects:** Entrectinib may cause heart problems; patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions should be monitored closely.
* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects:**  Entrectinib can cause various CNS side effects. Patients should be monitored, and activities requiring alertness should be approached with caution.
* **Ocular Toxicity:** Vision problems can occur. Regular eye examinations may be necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Entrectinib with food?** A: Entrectinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose unless the next dose is due within 12 hours.

* **Q: How should I store Entrectinib?** A: Store Entrectinib as directed on the product label.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Entrectinib?** A: Because of potential CNS side effects like dizziness and cognitive impairment, caution should be exercised when engaging in activities that require alertness.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Entrectinib?** A: Long-term effects vary by individual. Discuss potential long-term effects with your healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
