# Empagliflozin
### Generic Name
Empagliflozin

### Usage

Empagliflozin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It's used as an adjunct to diet and exercise, meaning it works best when combined with lifestyle changes.  Importantly, it also reduces the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.  Furthermore, it's been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure, regardless of diabetes status.  Empagliflozin is *not* suitable for type 1 diabetes or for treating diabetic ketoacidosis.  It's also not recommended for improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m².


### Dosage

**Adults:**  The starting dose for treating type 2 diabetes is typically 10 mg once daily (OD).  This may be increased to 25 mg OD after 4-12 weeks if needed to reach blood sugar goals. For patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, the dose can be 10 or 25 mg OD to reduce cardiovascular risk.  In heart failure, the dose is 10 mg OD.  For patients with diabetic kidney disease (off-label use), the dose is 10 mg OD, though it's not yet established whether higher doses provide additional kidney protection.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of empagliflozin in children under 18 have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dose adjustment is usually necessary for hepatic impairment. For renal impairment, adjustments may be needed based on eGFR; consult a healthcare professional for guidance.  Empagliflozin is contraindicated in patients undergoing hemodialysis or certain types of renal replacement therapy (CRRT and PIRRT).


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Increased thirst
* Nausea
* Increased hematocrit (red blood cell concentration)
* Genitourinary infections (yeast infections, urinary tract infections)
* Increased urine output
* Dyslipidemia (changes in blood fats)


**Less Common (Less than 1% but serious):**

* Hypovolemia (low blood volume)
* Ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes)
* Acute kidney injury
* Acute pancreatitis
* Hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, allergic reactions)
* Necrotizing fasciitis (a severe bacterial infection of the soft tissues)
* Phimosis (narrowing of the foreskin)

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as less common, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Empagliflozin is an SGLT2 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2) inhibitor.  It works in the kidneys by blocking the reabsorption of glucose from the bloodstream back into the body.  This leads to increased excretion of glucose in the urine, thereby lowering blood sugar levels.  Additionally, it affects sodium reabsorption, potentially reducing blood pressure and heart strain.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Empagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to empagliflozin, severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²), end-stage renal disease, or those undergoing hemodialysis or certain types of renal replacement therapy.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Empagliflozin can interact with diuretics (water pills), increasing the risk of dehydration. It can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) when used with insulin or other blood sugar-lowering medications.
* **Specific Populations:**  Empagliflozin is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.  Breastfeeding is also not recommended while using this medication.  Older adults may be at higher risk for dehydration and kidney problems.
* **Warnings:**  Monitor for signs of dehydration, urinary tract infections, yeast infections, ketoacidosis, and kidney problems.  Temporary discontinuation may be necessary before surgery.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take empagliflozin with other medications?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications, especially diuretics and insulin or insulin secretagogues.
* **Q: How should I store empagliflozin?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Is empagliflozin safe for everyone?** A: No, it's not suitable for everyone. People with certain kidney conditions or allergies should not use it.  Always consult your doctor before starting any new medication.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience serious side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions, signs of ketoacidosis, or significant kidney problems.
