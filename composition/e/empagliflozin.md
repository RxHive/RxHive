# Empagliflozin

**Generic Name:** Empagliflozin

**Usage:**

Empagliflozin is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's often used in combination with other diabetes medications, or alone if those medications aren't enough.  Additionally, it's approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.  Some formulations are also approved to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and with and without established cardiovascular disease.  It's important to note that empagliflozin is *not* for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Increased urination can increase the risk of UTIs.
* **Yeast infections (candidiasis):**  Especially in women.
* **Dehydration:** Due to increased urination.
* **Genital yeast infections:**  Increased frequency and severity.
* **Increased urination:** This can lead to nocturia (waking up at night to urinate).
* **Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia):** Especially when used with insulin or other medications that lower blood sugar.
* **Ketoacidosis:** A serious complication characterized by high levels of ketones in the blood.  This is more likely in people with type 1 diabetes or those with severely limited kidney function, but it can occur even in people with type 2 diabetes.
* **High blood potassium (hyperkalemia):**  Especially when taken with other medications that can raise potassium levels.
* **Leg and foot amputations** (increased risk): While rare, there is some evidence linking SGLT2 inhibitors to an increased risk of lower extremity amputation, particularly in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).


Serious side effects, though less common, include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.
* **Fournier's gangrene:** A rare but serious infection of the genitals.


**How it Works:**

Empagliflozin belongs to a class of drugs called sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.  It works by preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose into the bloodstream.  Instead, the glucose is excreted in the urine, leading to lower blood sugar levels.  This mechanism also leads to increased urination and potentially weight loss.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take empagliflozin with other medications?**  You should discuss all your medications with your doctor before starting empagliflozin, as it can interact with other drugs, particularly those affecting kidney function or potassium levels.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking empagliflozin?**  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of dehydration and hypoglycemia.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **How is empagliflozin different from other diabetes medications?**  Unlike many other diabetes medications that work by increasing insulin production or improving insulin sensitivity, empagliflozin works by increasing glucose excretion in the urine.
* **What are the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?**  Symptoms can include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, hunger, confusion, and rapid heartbeat.  Treat low blood sugar by consuming a fast-acting carbohydrate source.
* **Should I monitor my blood sugar levels?** Yes, regular blood sugar monitoring is important while taking empagliflozin, especially at the beginning of treatment.  Your doctor will advise on the appropriate monitoring frequency.
* **Can empagliflozin cause weight loss?**  Yes, it can lead to weight loss due to increased glucose excretion and potential diuretic effect, but weight loss is not guaranteed.
