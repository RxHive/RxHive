# Ethinyl Estradiol + Dienogest

**Generic Name:** Ethinyl Estradiol + Dienogest

**Usage:**  Ethinyl estradiol and dienogest is a combination birth control pill used to prevent pregnancy.  It may also be prescribed to treat symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or endometriosis,  although this is less common.  The specific brand name and formulation will determine the exact indication.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary widely depending on individual response and dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Bleeding irregularities:**  Spotting, breakthrough bleeding, changes in menstrual flow (heavier or lighter periods) are common, especially in the first few months of use.
* **Headache:**  Mild to moderate headaches can occur.
* **Breast tenderness:**  Breast pain or swelling.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Weight changes:** Weight gain or loss.
* **Mood changes:**  Mood swings, depression, anxiety.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  Though rare, it's important to monitor blood pressure regularly.
* **Other possible side effects:**  Increased risk of blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack (although this is a relatively low risk for healthy women), gallbladder disease, liver problems, and changes in cholesterol levels.


**How it Works:** This combination pill works primarily by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen that suppresses the pituitary gland from releasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thus inhibiting ovulation. Dienogest is a progestin that thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg, and it also alters the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.

**FAQs:**

* **What if I miss a pill?**  Follow the instructions provided with your specific brand. Missing pills can decrease effectiveness.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you miss more than one pill.
* **Can I take this pill if I smoke?** Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious side effects, including blood clots, heart attack, and stroke, especially in women over 35.  It's generally not recommended to take combination birth control pills if you smoke.
* **What are the long-term effects?**  Long-term use is generally safe for most women, but regular check-ups with your doctor are essential to monitor for potential side effects and to assess if the pill remains the best option for you.
* **Can I get pregnant while taking this pill?** While highly effective when taken correctly, it's not 100% effective.  Consistent use is crucial.
* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe side effects such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, sudden vision changes, or leg pain.
* **Can I take this pill if I have other medical conditions?**  You should always inform your doctor about all your medical conditions and medications before starting this pill.  Certain conditions, such as a history of blood clots, liver disease, or certain types of cancer, may make this medication unsuitable.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It is usually effective immediately if you start taking it on the first day of your menstrual cycle.  However, it may take a few cycles for your body to adjust to the hormones.
