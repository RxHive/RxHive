# Ethinyl Estradiol + Dienogest
### Generic Name
Ethinyl Estradiol + Dienogest

### Usage
Ethinyl estradiol and dienogest is a combined hormonal contraceptive, primarily used for preventing pregnancy.  It works by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening the cervical mucus to hinder sperm from reaching the egg, and altering the uterine lining to make it less receptive to a fertilized egg.  While its primary use is contraception, some formulations may also be used to treat symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), such as mood swings, bloating, and acne, although this is not the primary indication and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.  It's important to note that this medication does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific brand and formulation.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by your doctor and the medication packaging precisely.  Generally, it's taken orally as a tablet once daily, at roughly the same time each day, for 21 days followed by a 7-day break where a placebo pill or no pill is taken.  During the 7-day break, withdrawal bleeding usually occurs.  IV administration is not applicable for this medication.  Dosage adjustments are typically not made based on age or weight, but individual needs can vary.  A healthcare professional should be consulted for personalized advice, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Breast tenderness
*   Headaches
*   Mood changes
*   Weight changes (gain or loss)
*   Nausea
*   Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
*   Acne


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
*   Stroke
*   Heart attack
*   High blood pressure
*   Liver problems
*   Gallbladder disease
*   Changes in vision


If you experience any of these serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen, and dienogest is a synthetic progestin.  These hormones work together to suppress the hormonal processes that lead to ovulation.  Ethinyl estradiol helps to regulate the menstrual cycle and contribute to the thickening of the cervical mucus.  Dienogest plays a role in suppressing ovulation and altering the uterine lining.  By acting on these multiple mechanisms, the combined effect prevents pregnancy.

### Precautions
Ethinyl estradiol + dienogest is contraindicated in individuals with certain conditions, including:

*   Current or history of blood clots
*   Stroke or heart attack
*   Breast cancer or other estrogen-sensitive cancers
*   Liver disease
*   Uncontrolled high blood pressure
*   Migraines with aura
*   Smoking (especially in women over 35)
*   Pregnancy or breastfeeding


This medication may interact with other drugs, including some antibiotics and anticonvulsants.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  This medication should be used cautiously in individuals with a history of depression, diabetes, or epilepsy.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use this medication. Older adults should also be aware of increased risk for cardiovascular issues before taking this medication.  Consult your doctor regarding the risks and benefits.
