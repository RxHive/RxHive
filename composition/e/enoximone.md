# Enoximone
### Generic Name
Enoximone

### Usage
Enoximone is a medication used for the short-term treatment of decompensated heart failure.  Specifically, it's employed in situations where the heart's ability to pump blood (cardiac output) is reduced, and the pressure within the heart chambers during filling is increased.  This medication is intended for use when other treatments haven't provided adequate relief.  It is *not* a long-term solution for heart failure.

### Dosage
Enoximone is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's response and overall condition.  The information below is for guidance only; a healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage and administration schedule.

**Adult Dosage (Decompensated Heart Failure):**

* **Initiation of Treatment:**  A slow intravenous infusion typically begins with 0.5-1 mg/kg (maximum infusion rate of 12.5 mg/min).  Additional doses of 0.5 mg/kg may be given every 30 minutes as needed, until a satisfactory response is seen or a maximum cumulative dose of 3 mg/kg is reached.  Alternatively, an initial bolus infusion of 90 mcg/kg/min for 10-30 minutes may be used until a response is observed.

* **Maintenance Therapy:**  Following the initial dose, maintenance therapy may involve repeat bolus doses of up to 3 mg/kg every 3-6 hours or a continuous or intermittent infusion of 5-20 mcg/kg/min, with a maximum daily dose of 24 mg/kg.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of enoximone in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However, healthcare providers may reduce the dose or frequency in patients with kidney problems.  For liver impairment, discontinuation of the drug may be necessary if significant increases in liver enzyme levels occur.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Insomnia
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Increased serum bilirubin levels
* Increased serum transaminase levels (liver enzymes)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Chills
* Decreased hematocrit/hemoglobin
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Fever
* Fluid retention
* Increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels
* Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Increased serum glucose levels
* Increased uric acid levels
* Irritation at injection site
* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Nausea
* Oliguria (reduced urine output)
* Supraventricular cardiac arrhythmias
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Urinary retention
* Ventricular tachycardia (rapid heart rhythm)
* Vomiting

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Enoximone is a selective phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) inhibitor. PDE3 enzymes break down cyclic GMP (cGMP), a molecule that plays a role in relaxing blood vessels and increasing the force of heart contractions. By inhibiting PDE3, enoximone increases cGMP levels. This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing the workload on the heart, and increased contractility (the heart's ability to pump blood more forcefully).  These effects improve cardiac output and reduce filling pressures in the heart.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Enoximone is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to enoximone or any component of the formulation.

* **Increased Risks:**  Patients using enoximone may have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), gastrointestinal symptoms, elevated liver enzyme levels, hypotension, and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

* **Cautions:** Enoximone should be used cautiously in patients with obstructive valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (thickening of the heart muscle), other outflow tract obstructions, renal impairment, hepatic disease, epilepsy, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding (due to the alcohol content in some injectable formulations).

* **Drug Interactions:** Enoximone may increase the levels or effects of anagrelide and riociguat.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

**Q: How is enoximone stored?** Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Generally, medications should be stored away from light and moisture, and at room temperature.

**Q: How long does it take to work?** The onset of action varies depending on the individual and the dosage.  Effects may be seen relatively quickly after infusion.

**Q: Can I take enoximone with other medications?**  It is crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting enoximone to avoid potential interactions.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Since enoximone is typically administered in a hospital setting by healthcare professionals, missing a dose isn't typically a concern. Contact your doctor or the healthcare team if you have questions.
