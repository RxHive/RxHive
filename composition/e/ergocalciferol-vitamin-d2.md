# Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2)
### Generic Name
Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2)

### Usage
Ergocalciferol, also known as Vitamin D2, is primarily used to treat and prevent conditions stemming from vitamin D deficiency.  Its main uses include:

* **Hypoparathyroidism:** A condition where the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone, leading to low blood calcium levels.  Ergocalciferol helps regulate calcium and phosphorus levels.
* **Osteoporosis:** A disease characterized by weakened bones, making them prone to fractures.  Ergocalciferol aids in bone mineral density improvement.
* **Vitamin D-resistant rickets:** A rare form of rickets where the body doesn't respond properly to vitamin D, leading to bone deformities.  Ergocalciferol helps to address this resistance.
* **Familial hypophosphatemia:** An inherited disorder causing low levels of phosphate in the blood, impacting bone development. Ergocalciferol is often used in conjunction with phosphate supplements.

Beyond these primary uses, ergocalciferol is also used as a supplement to ensure adequate vitamin D intake, particularly in individuals at risk of deficiency (e.g., older adults, those with limited sun exposure).


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and other individual factors.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.  The following are general guidelines and should not be considered medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA):**  600 IU (15 mcg) for most adults aged 19-70, including pregnant and lactating women.
* **Osteoporosis:** 800-1000 IU (20-25 mcg) daily, often combined with calcium supplements.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:** 50,000-200,000 IU (0.625-5 mg) daily, usually with calcium supplements.
* **Vitamin D-resistant rickets:** 12,000-500,000 IU (0.3-12.5 mg) daily.
* **Familial hypophosphatemia:** 10,000-60,000 IU (0.25-1.5 mg) daily, along with phosphate supplements.

**Children:**

* **RDA:** 400 IU (10 mcg) daily for infants (0-12 months); 600 IU (15 mcg) daily for children aged 1-18 years.
* **Vitamin D-resistant rickets:** 12,000-500,000 IU (0.3-12.5 mg) daily.
* **Familial hypophosphatemia:** 40,000-80,000 IU (1-2 mg) daily, combined with phosphate supplements.  Dosage may be reduced after the growth spurt.

Ergocalciferol is typically administered orally, in tablet or liquid form.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild but can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Dry mouth
* Metallic taste
* Lethargy
* Muscle or bone pain

Less common, but more serious, side effects are related to Vitamin D toxicity (hypervitaminosis D) and include:

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Confusion
* Calcification of soft tissues

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ergocalciferol is a prohormone; the body converts it into the active form, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). Calcitriol regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption from the gut, bone turnover, and renal reabsorption of phosphate.  This, in turn, helps maintain healthy blood calcium and phosphorus levels crucial for bone health and other bodily functions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ergocalciferol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to vitamin D, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), and severe hypervitaminosis D.  It's also typically contraindicated in those with malabsorption syndromes, though careful dosing may be possible in some cases under strict medical supervision.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several medications can interact with ergocalciferol, altering its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  These include, but are not limited to, bile acid sequestrants, mineral oil, orlistat, cardiac glycosides, and thiazide diuretics. Discuss all your medications with your doctor before starting ergocalciferol.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ergocalciferol is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established. While the RDA is higher during pregnancy,  large doses should be avoided.  Ergocalciferol is excreted in breast milk, and infant monitoring may be needed if high doses are administered to the mother.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for signs of vitamin D toxicity, especially with high doses.  Individuals with kidney problems should use caution, as the kidneys play a role in vitamin D metabolism.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ergocalciferol with other supplements?** A:  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all supplements you are taking, as interactions may occur.
* **Q: How should I store ergocalciferol?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Is ergocalciferol safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use is possible for certain conditions but should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional to monitor for side effects and adjust dosage as needed.  Regular blood tests to check calcium levels may be recommended.
* **Q: Can I get too much vitamin D?** A: Yes, excessive vitamin D intake can lead to hypercalcemia and other serious health problems. Always follow the recommended dosage carefully.
