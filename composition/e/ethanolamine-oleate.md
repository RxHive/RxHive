# Ethanolamine Oleate
### Generic Name
Ethanolamine Oleate

### Usage

Ethanolamine oleate is a sclerosing agent primarily used to treat and prevent rebleeding from esophageal varices that have recently bled.  It works by inducing inflammation and fibrosis within the varices, ultimately leading to their closure and preventing further bleeding episodes.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* used for esophageal varices that haven't bled or for varicosities in other locations like the legs.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** Submucosal injection is strongly discouraged due to the risk of complications like ulceration, necrosis, and delayed esophageal perforation.  The recommended route of administration is intravenous injection directly into the varices.

**Adults (Esophageal Varices with Recent Bleeding):**

* Intravenous (IV) injection: 1.5-5 mL per varix, with a maximum total dose of 20 mL per treatment session.
* Treatment may be given during the acute bleeding episode and repeated as needed after 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, depending on the patient's response and clinical assessment.
* Patients with existing cardiopulmonary disease should generally receive a lower dose than the maximum recommended amount.

**Children:**

The safety and efficacy of ethanolamine oleate have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  While no specific dosage adjustments are given in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic impairment, individuals with significant liver dysfunction (such as those with Child-Pugh class C hepatic impairment) should typically receive less than the maximum recommended dose.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Cardiovascular: Substernal pain
* Gastrointestinal: Esophageal ulcer and esophageal stenosis
* Respiratory: Pleural effusion and pneumonia
* Other: Fever

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Acute renal failure
* Anaphylaxis
* Esophageal perforation
* Esophagitis
* Tissue necrosis at the injection site

**Important:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Ethanolamine oleate functions as a sclerosing agent.  When injected into esophageal varices, it creates a sterile, dose-dependent inflammatory response. This inflammation leads to fibrosis (scarring) and eventual occlusion (closure) of the affected veins.  A dose-related inflammatory reaction also occurs outside the vessel as the drug diffuses through the vein wall. This process effectively stops bleeding and prevents future episodes.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to ethanolamine, oleic acid, ethanolamine oleate, or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings/Increased Risk:**

* Fatal anaphylactic shock
* Acute renal failure (with potential for spontaneous recovery)
* Severe injection necrosis

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with concurrent cardiopulmonary disease.
* In patients with Child-Pugh class C hepatic impairment.
* In critically ill patients.
* In elderly patients.
* In breastfeeding women (excretion in breast milk is unknown).

**Important Safety Measures:**  Use appropriate injection techniques to minimize the risk of necrosis, particularly if larger volumes are used.  Strictly avoid submucosal injections.


### FAQs

**Q: How is ethanolamine oleate administered?**

A:  It's administered intravenously directly into the esophageal varices. Submucosal injection is contraindicated.

**Q: How long does treatment last?**

A: The treatment course varies depending on the individual's response.  It may involve multiple injections over several months.

**Q: What are the potential long-term effects?**

A:  Long-term effects can include esophageal stenosis (narrowing) or ulceration. Regular endoscopic monitoring is crucial to detect and manage these complications.

**Q: Can ethanolamine oleate be used for leg varicose veins?**

A: No, it's specifically indicated for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices, not other types of varicose veins.

**Q: How should ethanolamine oleate be stored?**

A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product label.

**Q:  Who should I contact if I have concerns?**

A: Contact your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have questions or concerns about ethanolamine oleate.
