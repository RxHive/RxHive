# Edoxaban
### Generic Name
Edoxaban

### Usage
Edoxaban is primarily used to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (blood clots traveling through the bloodstream) in adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disorder).  This means it helps prevent serious complications from irregular heartbeats.  It's also used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT, blood clots in the leg veins) and pulmonary embolism (PE, blood clots in the lungs) after initial treatment with injectable blood thinners.  In these cases, it helps prevent further clot formation and allows the existing clots to dissolve.


### Dosage

**Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, patient weight, and kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.**

**Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (Stroke Prevention):**

*   Typical dose: 60 mg once daily (OD).
*   **Important Note:**  Edoxaban is *not* recommended for patients with a CrCl greater than 95 mL/min due to an increased risk of stroke.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (CrCl 15-50 mL/min).

**Venous Thromboembolism (DVT/PE Treatment):**

*   After at least 5-10 days of initial treatment with injectable anticoagulants:
    *   Patients weighing >60 kg: 60 mg OD.
    *   Patients weighing â‰¤60 kg: 30 mg OD.
    *   Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (CrCl 15-50 mL/min). Edoxaban is not recommended for patients with CrCl <15 mL/min or those undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.


**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of edoxaban have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney and liver function significantly impact edoxaban's effectiveness and safety. Dosage adjustments or contraindications apply in cases of moderate-to-severe liver impairment or significantly reduced kidney function.  Obesity can also affect absorption, and  individualized assessment may be needed in these cases. Consult a healthcare professional for guidance on appropriate dosage adjustments.

**Administration:**  Edoxaban is typically administered orally (as a tablet).  The tablets can be crushed and mixed with applesauce or water if swallowing difficulties exist; administer this mixture immediately.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (may occur in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Bleeding (major and minor, at various sites including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and genitourinary system).  This is the most significant side effect.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)
*   Spinal hematoma (bleeding in the spinal cord), particularly in patients undergoing spinal procedures or receiving neuraxial anesthesia.
*   Allergic reactions (angioedema, hypersensitivity)
*   Anemia (low red blood cell count)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

**Other Side Effects:**  Numerous other side effects have been reported, including gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain), dizziness, headache, and skin rash.

**Important Note:** If you experience any unusual bleeding, bruising, or other concerning symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Edoxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor.  Factor Xa is a crucial enzyme in the blood clotting cascade. By blocking factor Xa, edoxaban prevents the formation of thrombin, a key protein responsible for blood clot formation.  This reduces the risk of blood clots and helps prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation, as well as the progression of DVT and PE.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  Active pathological bleeding, hypersensitivity to edoxaban, conditions increasing bleeding risk (e.g., recent stroke, peptic ulcer), impaired hemostasis, severe liver disease, concomitant use with other anticoagulants (except during medication switching), pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
*   **Increased Risk of Bleeding:**  Edoxaban significantly increases the risk of bleeding.  This risk is higher with concomitant use of other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, NSAIDs, or certain antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs).
*   **Neuraxial Anesthesia:**  The use of edoxaban increases the risk of spinal or epidural hematomas in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal punctures. Close monitoring is essential.
*   **Kidney Function:**  Reduced kidney function necessitates dosage adjustments.  Edoxaban is not recommended for individuals with severe kidney impairment (CrCl <15 mL/min) or those on dialysis.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Edoxaban can interact with several drugs, potentially increasing bleeding risk or altering its effectiveness.  Discuss all medications with your doctor.
*   **Surgery:**  Edoxaban should generally be stopped before surgery, the timing depending on the type of surgery, bleeding risk, and kidney function.  Restarting edoxaban after surgery should be guided by your physician.
*   **Pregnant/Breastfeeding Women:**  Edoxaban is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

*   **Can I take edoxaban with other medications?**  Discuss all medications with your doctor to assess potential interactions and risks.
*   **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day. Do not double the dose.
*   **How should I store edoxaban?** Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
*   **Can I drink alcohol while taking edoxaban?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of bleeding. Limit alcohol consumption while taking edoxaban. Consult your doctor.
*   **What are the long-term effects of edoxaban?**  Long-term effects are not fully known but may include an increased risk of bleeding with prolonged use. Regular monitoring is crucial.
*   **When should I stop taking edoxaban?**  Only stop taking edoxaban under your doctor's guidance.  Stopping suddenly can increase the risk of serious complications.
