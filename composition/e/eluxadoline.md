# Eluxadoline
### Generic Name
Eluxadoline

### Usage
Eluxadoline is primarily used to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).  It's specifically designed to alleviate the symptoms associated with this condition, which include abdominal pain and frequent, loose stools.  It's important to note that eluxadoline is not a cure for IBS-D, but rather a treatment to manage the symptoms.  It does not address the underlying cause of IBS-D.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical adult dose for IBS-D is 100 mg twice daily (BID).  However, this may be reduced to 75 mg BID if the patient experiences side effects.  Eluxadoline is available in oral capsule form.  It's recommended to take it with food.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of eluxadoline in children have not been established, and it is therefore not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), the dose should be reduced to 75 mg BID.  Eluxadoline is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²).  Consult a healthcare professional for specific dosage recommendations in these cases.  For patients with eGFR <15 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (ESRD without dialysis need), the dose is 75mg BID.

### How it Works
Eluxadoline is a mixed opioid receptor modulator.  This means it affects different types of opioid receptors in the gut.  It acts as an agonist at mu-opioid receptors and kappa-opioid receptors, while simultaneously acting as an antagonist at delta-opioid receptors. This unique interaction helps reduce abdominal pain and diarrhea by influencing gut motility and reducing the sensation of pain in the intestines.  Importantly, it's designed to have a primarily local effect in the gut, minimizing systemic opioid effects.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Eluxadoline is contraindicated (should not be used) in the following situations:

* Allergy to eluxadoline or any of its ingredients
* Absence of a gallbladder
* History of pancreatitis or pancreatic structural diseases
* Known or suspected biliary duct obstruction or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction
* Alcoholism or consumption of >3 alcoholic beverages daily
* Severe hepatic impairment
* History of chronic or severe constipation or its sequelae


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of constipation, hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, and sphincter of Oddi spasm.
* Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
* Not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to a lack of safety data.  The decision to breastfeed while taking eluxadoline should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.
*  Eluxadoline has some potential for drug abuse and psychological dependence. Naloxone should be considered in case of overdose.


**Drug Interactions:** Eluxadoline can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  Specifically, concomitant use with alosetron, opioid analgesics, anticholinergic agents, and loperamide is not recommended because it may increase the risk of constipation.  Simultaneous use with certain drugs affecting liver enzymes (e.g., atazanavir, cyclosporine, rifampin, ritonavir) may also require caution or dose adjustments.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take eluxadoline with other medications?** A: It's crucial to discuss all your medications with your doctor before starting eluxadoline.  Interactions are possible, and dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Q: How should I store eluxadoline?** A: Store eluxadoline as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is eluxadoline habit-forming?** A:  While the risk is relatively low compared to other opioids, eluxadoline does carry a slight potential for abuse and dependence.  This should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Q: Can I stop taking eluxadoline suddenly?** A: No, it's important to follow your doctor's instructions on how to discontinue eluxadoline to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms.
