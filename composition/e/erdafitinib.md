# Erdafitinib
### Generic Name
Erdafitinib

### Usage

Erdafitinib is a targeted cancer therapy specifically used to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (a type of bladder cancer).  It's crucial to note that this medication is only prescribed for patients whose cancer has a specific genetic alteration:  susceptible *FGFR3* or *FGFR2* alterations.  This means the cancer cells have changes in the genes *FGFR3* or *FGFR2*, making them sensitive to Erdafitinib.  The drug is typically used when the cancer has progressed despite at least one prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, even if that chemotherapy was given within the previous 12 months (neoadjuvant or adjuvant).  Erdafitinib works by targeting and blocking specific proteins involved in cancer cell growth, effectively slowing or stopping the cancer's progression.  It's important to remember that Erdafitinib is not a cure for cancer; its purpose is to manage and potentially slow the disease's advancement.


### Dosage

The recommended starting dose of Erdafitinib for adults with urothelial carcinoma is 8 mg once daily (OD).  This is given orally as a tablet.  After 14-21 days of treatment, the doctor will check blood phosphate levels. If the phosphate level is below 5.5 mg/dL and there are no eye problems (ocular disorders) or significant side effects (grade ≥2 toxicity), the dose may be increased to 9 mg OD. The decision to increase the dose will depend on how well the patient tolerates the medication. Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or the side effects become intolerable.

Dosage adjustments are complex and should be managed by a healthcare provider, carefully considering factors like phosphate levels, eye problems, and other side effects.  Significant dose reductions may be necessary depending on the severity and type of side effects experienced.  There is no established dosage for children.  Dose modifications are also necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function, but specific recommendations are not yet definitively established in manufacturer's labeling and require careful clinical assessment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Diarrhea
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Decreased appetite
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Nail changes (onycholysis, discoloration)
* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Hand-foot skin reaction (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia)
* Low sodium levels
* High phosphate levels (hyperphosphatemia)
* Low albumin levels
* Urinary tract infection
* Low hemoglobin (anemia)
* Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Low white blood cell count (leukopenia)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Dry eye syndrome
* Retinal pigment epithelium detachment
* Blurred vision
* Conjunctivitis (eye inflammation)
* Increased creatinine levels
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
* Fever

Less common but serious side effects include:  severe eye problems (retinal detachment), significant increases in phosphate levels, severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, serious infections.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Erdafitinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor.  It works by targeting and blocking the activity of several fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), including FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4.  These receptors are proteins found on the surface of some cells, including cancer cells.  When these receptors are overly active, they can signal the cells to grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer growth.  By blocking these receptors, Erdafitinib interferes with this signaling pathway, thereby slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells that rely on these signals for survival and proliferation.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Erdafitinib is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Hyperphosphatemia:**  Erdafitinib frequently causes increased phosphate levels in the blood (hyperphosphatemia).  Dietary phosphate restriction and phosphate binders may be necessary to manage this.  Regular monitoring of phosphate levels is essential.
* **Ocular Toxicity:**  Erdafitinib can cause eye problems, including central serous retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelial detachment.  Regular eye exams are crucial during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Erdafitinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for one month afterward.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one month after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Erdafitinib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  It's critical to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function, though current manufacturer's labeling doesn't give specific recommendations.  Close monitoring is essential in these populations.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I be on Erdafitinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and the progression of your cancer. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Erdafitinib?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol or limit alcohol consumption while on Erdafitinib, as it can interact with the medication and potentially increase side effects.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: How should I store Erdafitinib?** A: Store Erdafitinib tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Erdafitinib?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied. Regular monitoring and follow-up with your healthcare provider are crucial.  Discuss any concerns you have with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.
