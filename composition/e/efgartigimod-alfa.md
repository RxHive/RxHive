# Efgartigimod alfa
### Generic Name
Efgartigimod alfa

### Usage
Efgartigimod alfa is a medication used to treat generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults.  Specifically, it's indicated for those patients who test positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies.  Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue.  Efgartigimod alfa works by targeting the underlying cause of this weakness, making it a significant advancement in gMG treatment.  The drug does not have any notable secondary uses beyond this primary indication.

### Dosage
Efgartigimod alfa is administered intravenously (IV).  The recommended dosage for adults with generalized myasthenia gravis is 10 mg/kg (with a maximum dose of 1.2 g) once weekly for four consecutive weeks.  Subsequent treatment cycles may be considered based on a physician's assessment of the patient's response, but these should not begin sooner than 50 days after the start of the previous cycle.  There is no established dosage for children or adolescents as the safety and effectiveness in this population haven't been determined.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment aren't specified in the manufacturer's labeling; however,  mild renal impairment (eGFR 60–89 mL/min/1.73m²) generally doesn't require adjustment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Respiratory tract infection
* Decreased neutrophils (a type of white blood cell)
* Decreased white blood cell count (leukopenia)
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Development of antibodies to the drug

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Urinary tract infection

Less frequent but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema and allergic reactions) and infections.  It is crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Efgartigimod alfa is a type of monoclonal antibody fragment (an Fc fragment of a human IgG1 antibody). It works by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).  FcRn is a receptor protein that plays a crucial role in recycling IgG antibodies (immunoglobulins G), which are a type of antibody crucial to the immune system.  By binding to FcRn, Efgartigimod alfa prevents the recycling of IgG antibodies, leading to a reduction in circulating IgG levels. In patients with gMG, this reduction helps to decrease the levels of autoantibodies (antibodies targeting the body's own tissues) that contribute to muscle weakness and fatigue.  Effectively, it modulates the immune response causing the disease.

### Precautions
While there are no specific contraindications listed, several precautions are important:

* **Infections:** Efgartigimod alfa can increase the risk of infections. Patients should be up-to-date on their vaccinations before starting treatment and should avoid live vaccines during treatment.
* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:**  The potential for hypersensitivity reactions exists. Close monitoring during and after infusion is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with medications that also bind to FcRn (e.g., other monoclonal antibodies or immunoglobulins) may reduce the effectiveness of those medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Alternative treatments are recommended during pregnancy. The excretion of Efgartigimod alfa in breast milk is unknown; therefore, a careful risk-benefit assessment is required before breastfeeding during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Efgartigimod alfa administered?** A: It's administered intravenously over one hour.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor as soon as possible; the dose may be administered within 3 days of the missed dose.
* **Q: How is Efgartigimod alfa stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication. It's typically refrigerated.
* **Q: Are there any specific monitoring requirements while on this medication?** A: Yes, close monitoring for signs of infection and hypersensitivity reactions during and after infusion is vital.
* **Q:  Can I receive live vaccines while taking Efgartigimod alfa?** A: No. Live vaccines are generally not recommended during treatment due to the reduced levels of IgG antibodies.
