# Emicizumab
### Generic Name
Emicizumab

### Usage
Emicizumab is a medication used for the routine prophylaxis (prevention) of bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia A.  Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency or absence of factor VIII, a crucial clotting protein. This deficiency leads to excessive bleeding. Emicizumab is particularly useful in patients with hemophilia A, whether or not they have developed inhibitors to factor VIII (antibodies that prevent factor VIII from working effectively).  It's designed to prevent bleeding episodes rather than treat them after they occur.

### Dosage

Emicizumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  Dosage varies depending on the individual’s weight and the chosen treatment regimen, but the general approach is as follows:

* **Adults and children:** The initial loading dose is typically 3 mg/kg once weekly for four weeks.  After the loading dose, the maintenance dose can be one of the following, with the choice determined by the healthcare provider to optimize patient adherence:
    * 1.5 mg/kg once weekly
    * 3 mg/kg every two weeks
    * 6 mg/kg every four weeks.
* **Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare professional should always be consulted regarding dosage adjustments based on individual needs.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Injection site reactions (such as redness, pain, itching, and erythema)


Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Diarrhea
* Injection site pruritus (itching)
* Development of antibodies against Emicizumab
* Fever

Serious, but less common side effects that have been reported include thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and thromboembolism (blood clots).  These are rare, but prompt medical attention is crucial if any symptoms of these conditions develop.  Always consult a healthcare provider if any concerning side effects occur.

### How it Works

Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody.  This means it binds to two different clotting factors, factor IXa and factor X.  In individuals with hemophilia A, factor VIII is deficient or dysfunctional. Emicizumab acts as a bridge between factor IXa and factor X, essentially mimicking the function of activated factor VIII.  This restored interaction allows for the normal blood clotting cascade to proceed, thus reducing bleeding risk. Unlike factor VIII, emicizumab does not induce the formation of inhibitors.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Emicizumab is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to emicizumab or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and thromboembolism (blood clots), particularly with concomitant administration of activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC). Close monitoring is vital.
* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with a history of TMA or those taking medications that may increase TMA risk (e.g., cyclosporine, quinine, tacrolimus).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Emicizumab should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. The safety of emicizumab during breastfeeding is unknown. Consult a doctor before making any decisions.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Warfarin can decrease the effectiveness of Emicizumab.  The risk of side effects may also be increased when used with other monoclonal antibodies.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Emicizumab stored?** A: Storage instructions should be followed carefully as provided by the pharmacist or healthcare provider. Generally, it’s important to keep it refrigerated.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but do not take two doses in one day to compensate.
* **Q:  Can I self-inject Emicizumab?** A:  Usually yes, but this should be demonstrated and approved by a healthcare professional. Self-injection may not be appropriate for all age groups.
* **Q: How long does it take for Emicizumab to work?** A: The effect on bleeding risk usually becomes apparent within days to weeks.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse reaction, especially those that are severe or unexpected.
