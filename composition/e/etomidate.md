# Etomidate
### Generic Name
Etomidate

### Usage
Etomidate is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic primarily used for the induction of general anesthesia. This means it's administered to quickly put a patient to sleep before surgery or other procedures requiring general anesthesia.  It's also used to supplement other anesthetic agents during short surgical procedures, helping to maintain anesthesia.  Off-label uses include procedural sedation (sedation for procedures outside of the operating room) and, in some cases, the management of Cushing's syndrome by inhibiting steroid synthesis.  However, its off-label use should only be considered under strict medical supervision by experienced professionals.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Induction of general anesthesia:** 0.3 mg/kg intravenously (IV) over 30-60 seconds. The dosage range can be from 0.2 to 0.6 mg/kg, depending on individual needs and responses.
* **Rapid sequence intubation:** 0.3 mg/kg IV. In hemodynamically unstable patients, a lower dose of 0.2 mg/kg may be considered.
* **Procedural sedation (off-label):** 0.1-0.2 mg/kg IV initially, followed by 0.05 mg/kg every 3-5 minutes as needed.  This is an off-label use and should be managed by experienced professionals.
* **Cushing's Syndrome (off-label):**  0.2-0.6 mg/kg IV over 30-60 seconds for induction of anesthesia or a continuous infusion of 0.04-0.05 mg/kg/hr in the ICU (requiring continuous monitoring). This is also an off-label use.

**Children:**

* For children over 10 years old, the dosage is generally the same as for adults.  
* For procedural sedation (off-label) in children, the starting dose is 0.1-0.4 mg/kg IV.
* For rapid sequence intubation (off-label), the dosage is 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV.
* **Important Note:** The FDA cautions against repeated or long-term use of general anesthetics and sedatives in children under 3 or pregnant women in their third trimester due to potential effects on brain development.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, especially in patients with renal impairment, where the risk of toxicity may be higher.


### Side Effects

**Common:**

* Myoclonus (muscle jerks)
* Nausea and vomiting (upon waking from anesthesia)
* Pain at the injection site
* Adrenal suppression (reduced cortisol production)
* Hiccups
* Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)
* Transient skeletal muscle movements

**Less Common but Serious:**

* Apnea (cessation of breathing)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hypoventilation (decreased breathing)
* Hyperventilation (increased breathing)
* Laryngospasm (spasm of the voice box)
* Muscle spasms
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Etomidate is a short-acting non-barbiturate hypnotic.  It works by binding to GABA receptors in the brain, enhancing the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses. This results in a rapid onset of sedation and loss of consciousness.  At higher doses, it can cause burst suppression on electroencephalograms (EEGs), indicating significant depression of brain activity.  Importantly, etomidate does not provide analgesia (pain relief).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Etomidate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to etomidate or any of its components, including those with hypersensitivity to soy or peanuts (due to the formulation).
* **Increased Risk:**  Long-term use increases the risk of adrenal suppression, heart failure, and potential neurotoxicity in children.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Etomidate can enhance the effects of other sedatives, opioids, and hypotensive drugs. Concomitant use should be avoided or carefully managed.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Etomidate is a Category C drug in pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does etomidate last?** A: Etomidate is an ultra-short-acting anesthetic.  Its effects typically wear off within a few minutes to an hour, depending on the dose and individual factors.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving etomidate?** A: No.  Etomidate causes drowsiness and impaired coordination. Avoid driving or operating machinery for at least 24 hours after receiving the medication.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol after receiving etomidate?** A: It's recommended to abstain from alcohol for at least 24 hours after etomidate administration to avoid additive effects on the central nervous system.

* **Q: How is etomidate stored?** A:  Store etomidate as directed by the manufacturer, typically at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of etomidate?** A: While generally well-tolerated for short-term use, long-term or repeated use carries a risk of adrenal suppression, potentially leading to adrenal insufficiency. This is why it's primarily used for short procedures.
