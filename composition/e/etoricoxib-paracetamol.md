# Etoricoxib + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Etoricoxib + Paracetamol (various brand names exist)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis: Pain and inflammation in joints due to cartilage breakdown.
* Rheumatoid arthritis: A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting joints.
* Ankylosing spondylitis: A form of arthritis affecting the spine.
* Acute pain: Short-term pain following surgery or injury (as directed by a physician).  It is *not* typically used for ongoing, chronic pain management without specific physician guidance.
* Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps): Painful periods.


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, Etoricoxib + Paracetamol can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea.  More serious gastrointestinal issues, including ulcers and bleeding, are possible but less common.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and blood clots (though generally considered lower risk than some other NSAIDs).  This risk is increased with higher doses and longer durations of use.
* **Fluid Retention:** Swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Skin Reactions:** Rash, itching.
* **Liver Problems:**  Rare but serious.  Symptoms might include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
* **Kidney Problems:**  Rare but serious.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through two different mechanisms:

* **Etoricoxib:**  This is a selective COX-2 inhibitor. COX-2 enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which cause pain and inflammation. By selectively inhibiting COX-2, etoricoxib reduces pain and inflammation with less impact on the COX-1 enzyme (which protects the stomach lining).  However, it's important to note that some COX-1 inhibition still occurs, and the risk of gastrointestinal issues isn't entirely eliminated.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's thought to involve inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system.  This reduces the perception of pain and fever.  It does not have significant anti-inflammatory effects in the periphery.

The combination of etoricoxib and paracetamol offers a synergistic effect, meaning that the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  This allows for lower doses of each drug, potentially reducing the risk of side effects.
