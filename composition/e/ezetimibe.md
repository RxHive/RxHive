# Ezetimibe
### Generic Name
Ezetimibe

### Usage

Ezetimibe is primarily used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.  It's prescribed as an adjunct to diet, meaning it works best when combined with a healthy eating plan.  Its main purpose is to reduce high levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol),  apo B (a protein associated with cholesterol), and non-HDL cholesterol.  Ezetimibe achieves this by specifically blocking the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines.

Ezetimibe is used in several situations:

* **Primary hyperlipidemia:** This is high cholesterol that isn't caused by another underlying medical condition. Ezetimibe is often used alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering drugs, particularly statins.

* **Mixed hyperlipidemia:**  This involves elevated levels of various types of fats (lipids) in the blood. Ezetimibe is used here in conjunction with fenofibrate, another lipid-lowering medication.

* **Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH):** This is a rare, inherited condition leading to extremely high cholesterol levels.  In this case, Ezetimibe is used in combination with high doses of statins like atorvastatin or simvastatin.

* **Homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia):** This is a rare genetic disorder causing the body to absorb too much plant sterols. Ezetimibe helps lower these elevated plant sterol levels.

While not its primary use, Ezetimibe might be considered as part of a strategy to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events following an acute coronary syndrome (heart attack or unstable angina).  However, this is considered an off-label use and should only be done under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage depends on the specific condition being treated and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.

**Adults:**  The usual dose is 10 mg once daily.  This applies to primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, HoFH, and homozygous sitosterolemia.  The dose remains the same whether Ezetimibe is used alone or in combination with other medications.  The recommended dose is the same for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome (off-label use).

**Children:**  Use in children is limited and mostly restricted to those with familial hypercholesterolemia.  For children aged 5-9, the dose is usually 10 mg once daily. For children aged 10 and older,  the dose might also be 10 mg daily, but it's often used in combination with a statin like simvastatin.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  In patients with mild liver impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically needed, but caution is advised. Ezetimibe is generally not recommended for individuals with moderate to severe liver impairment.  In patients with kidney problems, dosage adjustment is usually not required, though caution is advised in cases of severe kidney disease.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Increased liver enzyme levels (particularly when combined with statins)
* Influenza-like symptoms
* Joint pain (arthralgia) and muscle pain (myalgia)
* Upper respiratory tract infections and sinusitis

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Abdominal pain
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Liver inflammation (hepatitis)
* Gallbladder problems (cholecystitis, cholelithiasis)
* Muscle pain or weakness that could lead to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) â€“ especially when combined with statins.
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Ezetimibe works by selectively inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol and related plant sterols in the small intestine. It acts on a specific protein called NPC1L1, which is responsible for transporting cholesterol into the intestinal cells. By blocking this transporter, Ezetimibe prevents cholesterol from being absorbed into the bloodstream, thus reducing the amount of cholesterol delivered to the liver.  This leads to a decrease in overall blood cholesterol levels, ultimately contributing to lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol and higher HDL ("good") cholesterol.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ezetimibe is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.  It should not be combined with statins in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevated liver enzymes.  It's also contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women when used concurrently with a statin.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ezetimibe absorption is reduced when taken with cholestyramine (a bile acid sequestrant).  It can increase the blood levels of cyclosporine (an immunosuppressant), and may increase the effect of blood thinners (oral anticoagulants).  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting Ezetimibe.

* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with mild liver impairment.  No dosage adjustment is usually necessary for those with renal impairment, but caution is advised in cases of severe renal impairment.

* **Monitoring:** Liver function tests (LFTs) may be monitored before and during treatment, especially when Ezetimibe is used with a statin.  Regular blood tests to monitor cholesterol levels are also important.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ezetimibe with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking. Some medications can interact with Ezetimibe.

* **Q: How should I store Ezetimibe?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Ezetimibe on my own?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping any medication, including Ezetimibe.  Suddenly stopping could affect your cholesterol levels.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Ezetimibe?** A: This depends on your individual situation and response to treatment.  Your doctor will determine the duration of treatment.
