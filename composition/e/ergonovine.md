# Ergonovine
### Generic Name
Ergonovine

### Usage
Ergonovine is primarily used to prevent and treat postpartum and post-abortion hemorrhage (heavy bleeding) resulting from uterine atony (weakness of the uterine muscles).  Uterine atony is a common cause of significant blood loss after childbirth or a miscarriage.  Ergonovine helps to strengthen the uterine muscles, reducing bleeding.


### Dosage
**Adults:** For postpartum or post-abortion hemorrhage, the typical dose is 0.2 mg administered either intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV).  The dose may be repeated every 2-4 hours as needed, but the total number of doses should not exceed five.  Intravenous administration should only be used in emergencies due to the increased risk of hypertension (high blood pressure) and stroke. Alternatively, 0.2-0.4 mg can be given 2-4 times daily for up to 48 hours or until the risk of uterine atony is passed, but for no longer than one week.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of ergonovine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare provider should be consulted for guidance in these situations.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Vertigo (spinning sensation)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* High blood pressure (hypertension)
* Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat)
* Abdominal pain


Less common, but more serious side effects, may include:

* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Stroke (cerebrovascular accident)
* Shock
* Severe hypertension
* Allergic reactions

If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Ergonovine is an ergot alkaloid. It works by directly stimulating the smooth muscles of the uterus, increasing their tone, the rate of contractions, and the strength of contractions. This leads to a strong and sustained contraction of the uterus, which helps to control postpartum or post-abortion bleeding by compressing blood vessels.  It has a slight alpha-adrenergic blocking effect, meaning it causes less vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) than other similar medications.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ergonovine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to ergonovine or other ergot preparations
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* During labor induction, threatened miscarriage, or pregnancy-induced hypertension (preeclampsia/eclampsia)
* Breastfeeding (if more than a single dose is given)
* Patients taking certain HIV medications (protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors)

**Warnings:** Ergonovine should be used with caution in patients with:

* Impaired liver or kidney function
* Sepsis (severe bloodstream infection)
* Vascular disease (diseases affecting blood vessels)
* Cardiovascular disease
* During the second stage of labor
* While under general anesthesia.

**Drug Interactions:** Ergonovine may interact with several other medications.  Concomitant use should be avoided with halothane (an anesthetic), prostaglandins, oxytocin (both of which enhance uterine contractions), CYP3A4 inhibitors, and sympathomimetics (medications that mimic the effects of the sympathetic nervous system) or other vasoconstrictors. Consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Ergonovine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully known. It should only be used in the postpartum period after placental delivery, and the possibility of twins should be excluded.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated when more than a single dose of Ergonovine is administered.


### FAQs

**Q: How is ergonovine stored?**
A: Store ergonovine at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Follow the specific storage instructions provided on the medication label.

**Q: Can I take ergonovine if I have high blood pressure?**
A: No, ergonovine is contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure.

**Q: How long does it take for ergonovine to work?**
A: The onset of action is relatively rapid; its effects on uterine contractions usually become apparent quickly, although the exact timing can vary.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: If you miss a dose, contact your doctor or healthcare provider for instructions. Do not double the dose.

**Q: What if I experience side effects?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
