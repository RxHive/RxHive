# Erythromycin + Sulfisoxazole
### Generic Name
Erythromycin + Sulfisoxazole

### Usage
This combination medication, containing the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfisoxazole, is specifically used to treat otitis media (middle ear infection) caused by susceptible strains of *Haemophilus influenzae* in infants aged 2 months and older and children.  It is not prescribed for adults.  This is a combination therapy leveraging the synergistic effects of two different antibiotic classes to combat bacterial infection.

### Dosage
**This medication is not for use in adults.**

**Pediatric Dosage (Infants ≥ 2 months and Children):**  Dosage is calculated based on either the erythromycin or sulfisoxazole component.  It's crucial to follow the healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The medication is available as an oral suspension (e.g., Erythromycin 220 mg/5 mL and Sulfisoxazole 600 mg/5 mL).  Dosage regimens vary, including:

* **General Dosing:** Erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day or Sulfisoxazole 150 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6-8 hours for 10 days. The maximum daily dose is Erythromycin 2 g/day or Sulfisoxazole 6 g/day.
* **Four-Times-a-Day Dosing:**  Dosage is weight-based and administered every 6 hours for 10 days.  See below for weight-specific recommendations.
    * Weight <8 kg: Dose adjusted based on body weight
    * Weight 8-16 kg: 2.5 mL (½ teaspoon)
    * Weight 16-24 kg: 5 mL (1 teaspoon)
    * Weight 24-32 kg: 7.5 mL (1 ½ teaspoons)
    * Weight >32 kg: 10 mL (2 teaspoons)
* **Three-Times-a-Day Dosing:** Dosage is weight-based and administered every 8 hours for 10 days. See below for weight-specific recommendations.
    * Weight <6 kg: Dose adjusted based on body weight
    * Weight 6-12 kg: 2.5 mL (½ teaspoon)
    * Weight 12-18 kg: 5 mL (1 teaspoon)
    * Weight 18-24 kg: 7.5 mL (1 ½ teaspoons)
    * Weight 24-30 kg: 10 mL (2 teaspoons)
    * Weight >30 kg: 12.5 mL (2 ½ teaspoons)

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is specified for hepatic impairment in the manufacturer's labeling, but caution is advised.  It is contraindicated in cases of severe hepatic impairment.  The medication is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min).


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity, jaundice)
* Blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Kidney problems (crystalluria, kidney stones)
* Nervous system effects (dizziness, headache, seizures)
* Skin reactions (rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

### How it Works
Erythromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing bacterial growth and replication. Sulfisoxazole acts as a competitive inhibitor of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component of folic acid synthesis in bacteria. By blocking PABA incorporation, sulfisoxazole disrupts bacterial folic acid production, ultimately inhibiting bacterial growth and causing cell death.  The combined action of these two different antibiotic mechanisms enhances the effectiveness against *Haemophilus influenzae*.


### Precautions
This combination is **contraindicated** in:

* Infants less than 2 months old.
* Pregnancy (especially late-term pregnancy) due to the risk of kernicterus in newborns.
* Breastfeeding mothers nursing infants less than 2 months old.
* Severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* Hypersensitivity to erythromycin, sulfonamides, or any component of the medication.
* Concomitant use with terfenadine, astemizole, and cisapride.
* Patients with documented megaloblastic or folate deficiency anemia.
* Patients with obstructive uropathy.
