# Everninomicin
### Generic Name
Everninomicin

### Usage
Everninomicin is a glycosidic-linked oligosaccharide antibiotic primarily designed to combat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.  It demonstrated activity against some gram-negative bacteria as well.  Its intended use was for treating infections resistant to other antibiotics.  However, it's important to note that clinical trials for everninomicin have been discontinued due to insufficient data demonstrating its efficacy and safety. Therefore, it is not currently available for clinical use.

### Dosage
Because clinical trials for everninomicin were discontinued, there are no established dosage recommendations for adults or children.  No specific administration guidelines (e.g., tablet, syrup, injection) are available.

### Side Effects
Since everninomicin did not progress to market authorization, a comprehensive list of common or rare side effects from human clinical trials is unavailable.

### How it Works
Everninomicin's mechanism of action involves interacting with the large ribosomal subunit (L16) of bacterial cells. This interaction disrupts bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately inhibiting bacterial growth and potentially leading to bacterial cell death.  This mechanism is common to many antibiotics.

### Precautions
Given the discontinuation of clinical trials, complete precaution information for everninomicin is unavailable.  This includes potential contraindications, drug interactions, and specific warnings for vulnerable populations (pregnant women, children, elderly).  It is crucial to understand that this medicine is not currently available for use and therefore precautions cannot be definitively stated.
