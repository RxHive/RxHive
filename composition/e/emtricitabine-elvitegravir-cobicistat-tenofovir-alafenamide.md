# Emtricitabine + Elvitegravir + Cobicistat + Tenofovir Alafenamide
### Generic Name
Emtricitabine + Elvitegravir + Cobicistat + Tenofovir Alafenamide

### Usage
This combination medication is a potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's primarily used in adults and children weighing at least 25 kg who are newly diagnosed with HIV-1 or require a change in their existing ART regimen.  The combination's effectiveness lies in its four active components, each targeting a different stage of the HIV life cycle, thereby suppressing viral replication effectively.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥18 years):**  The typical dose is one tablet taken once daily with food.

**Children and Adolescents (≥25 kg):** The dose is also one tablet once daily with food.  This medication is not recommended for children weighing less than 25 kg.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B).  However, it is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).

* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥30 mL/minute, no dose adjustment is necessary.  However, this medication is not recommended for those with CrCl <30 mL/minute or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) without hemodialysis.  In adults with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, one tablet should be taken once daily after the dialysis session on hemodialysis days.


The medication comes in a fixed-dose combination tablet.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and administration instructions precisely as directed by a healthcare provider.


### Side Effects

It's vital to report any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, to your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

This medication is a four-drug combination:

* **Elvitegravir:** An integrase inhibitor that blocks HIV-1 integrase, an enzyme crucial for HIV replication.  It prevents the virus from inserting its genetic material into the host cell's DNA.

* **Cobicistat:** A pharmacoenhancer that boosts the levels of Elvitegravir in the blood, improving its effectiveness.

* **Emtricitabine:** A nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that interferes with the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme. This enzyme converts viral RNA into DNA, a necessary step in the virus's replication cycle. Emtricitabine blocks this conversion.

* **Tenofovir Alafenamide:** Another NRTI, working similarly to Emtricitabine, but targeting a different part of the reverse transcriptase enzyme.

By targeting different stages of the HIV replication cycle, the combination medication efficiently suppresses the virus's ability to reproduce.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used with certain other drugs, especially those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme and that can cause serious side effects when their levels are increased. Consult a healthcare provider for a full list of such medications.

* **Interactions:**  This medication can interact with several other drugs, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  This medication may increase the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, and renal toxicity.  Careful monitoring is necessary, especially in patients with underlying kidney or liver conditions.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** This combination is not recommended during pregnancy due to reduced exposure of cobicistat and elvitegravir in the second and third trimesters and is not recommended for patients trying to conceive.  An alternative regimen is recommended for those who become pregnant during therapy. It is not known if all components are excreted in breast milk; thus, breastfeeding is not recommended.


* **Hepatitis B Co-infection:**  Patients with both HIV and Hepatitis B should be monitored closely for several months after stopping this medication because of the potential for a severe hepatitis B flare-up.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take this medication with other medicines?**
A:  It's vital to discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, with your doctor before starting this treatment to avoid potential interactions.

**Q: How should I store this medicine?**
A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take two doses at once to make up for a missed one.

**Q: Can I stop taking this medication if I feel better?**
A: No, it's crucial to continue taking this medication as prescribed even if you feel better. Stopping prematurely can lead to drug resistance and the resurgence of the virus.  Discontinuing treatment must be done under strict medical supervision.

**Q: What if I experience side effects?**
A: Report any side effects, especially severe or persistent ones, to your healthcare provider immediately.  They can provide guidance on managing side effects or adjusting the treatment plan.
