# Etonogestrel+Ethinyl Estradiol (Vaginal Ring)
### Generic Name
Etonogestrel + Ethinyl Estradiol (Vaginal Ring)

### Usage

The Etonogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol vaginal ring is a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) used primarily to prevent pregnancy in women.  It works by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening cervical mucus to hinder sperm movement, and altering the uterine lining to make implantation less likely.  This medication is not a treatment for any disease but rather a method of birth control.

### Dosage

**Adults:** One ring is inserted vaginally and left in place continuously for 3 weeks, then removed for 1 week. A new ring is inserted 7 days after the last ring is removed, regardless of whether bleeding is complete.  The ring should be inserted at approximately the same time of day each time.  

**Specific instructions for starting the ring depend on prior contraceptive use:**

* **No prior hormonal contraceptive use:** Insert the ring on the first day of the menstrual cycle (day 1).  It can also be inserted on days 2-5, but a barrier method (like condoms) should be used for the following 7 days.
* **Switching from another combined hormonal contraceptive:** Insert the ring on any day, ideally the day following the hormone-free interval of the previous method.
* **Switching from a progestin-only contraceptive (mini-pill, implant, IUD, injection):**  Consult the prescribing information for specific instructions; barrier methods may be necessary for the first 7 days.
* **Postpartum or post-abortion/miscarriage:** Instructions vary depending on the timing and type of event; a healthcare provider should provide guidance.

**Pediatric Use:** This medication is not intended for use before menarche (the onset of menstruation).  Its safety and efficacy have only been established in women of reproductive age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The medication is contraindicated in women with hepatic impairment (liver disease).  No dosage adjustments are needed for those with renal impairment (kidney disease), but careful monitoring is advised.

### How it Works

The Etonogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol vaginal ring delivers hormones—etonogestrel (a progestin) and ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen)—directly into the bloodstream through the vaginal lining.  These hormones suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This prevents ovulation, the main mechanism of action.  Additionally, the hormones alter cervical mucus, making it thicker and more difficult for sperm to penetrate, and they alter the uterine lining (endometrium), making implantation less likely, further reducing the chance of pregnancy.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in women with a history of:

* Blood clots (DVT, pulmonary embolism)
* Stroke
* Heart attack
* Breast cancer or other estrogen/progesterone-sensitive cancers
* Liver disease or tumors
* Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding
* Certain types of migraines
* Uncontrolled high blood pressure
* Smoking (especially in women over 35)
* Hypersensitivity to any component of the ring.


**Interactions:**  The effectiveness of the ring can be reduced by certain medications, including some antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and antifungal medications.  Some medications can also increase the levels of the hormones in the blood.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your healthcare provider.

**Warnings:**

* Women over 35 who smoke should not use this medication due to a significantly increased risk of serious cardiovascular events.
*  The risk of blood clots is increased, particularly postpartum.
*  This medication does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
*  Regular checkups are essential for monitoring your health while using this medication.
