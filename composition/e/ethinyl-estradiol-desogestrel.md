# Ethinyl Estradiol + Desogestrel
### Generic Name
Ethinyl Estradiol + Desogestrel

### Usage
Ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel is a combined oral contraceptive, commonly known as a birth control pill.  Its primary use is to prevent pregnancy.  This is achieved by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening cervical mucus to hinder sperm passage, and altering the uterine lining to make implantation of a fertilized egg less likely.  While primarily used for contraception, some formulations may be prescribed to treat certain conditions associated with hormonal imbalances, such as acne or heavy menstrual bleeding. However, it's crucial to understand that this is not its primary indication, and treatment should only be initiated under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.  The specific use will depend on the individual and their medical history.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation of the combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel.  The medication is usually taken orally, once daily, at approximately the same time each day.  Most regimens involve taking one pill daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break during which withdrawal bleeding occurs.  Some formulations may have a 28-day pack with 21 active pills and 7 inactive pills (placebos).  **It is crucial to follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There are no pediatric indications approved for this medication, and use during pregnancy is contraindicated.  Intravenous administration is not applicable for this medication.  The precise dosage should always be determined by a doctor considering the patient's age, overall health, and specific needs.  Never alter the prescribed dosage without consulting a doctor.

*   Breast tenderness

If you experience any adverse effects, even those not listed here, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen, and desogestrel is a synthetic progestin.  These hormones work together to prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing the release of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland.  This suppression inhibits ovulation.  The progestin component also thickens the cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to reach the egg.  Furthermore, it alters the uterine lining, reducing the chance of a fertilized egg implanting.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, liver disease, or certain other conditions.  It should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Many medications can interact with combined oral contraceptives.  It is essential to inform your doctor of all medications, herbal supplements, or over-the-counter drugs you are taking.  Some medications can decrease the effectiveness of the pill.
*   **Specific Warnings:**  Smokers, especially those over 35, are at increased risk of serious cardiovascular side effects.  Older adults may have a higher risk of specific adverse events associated with estrogen.  Women with a family history of blood clots or other conditions should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before starting this medication.
