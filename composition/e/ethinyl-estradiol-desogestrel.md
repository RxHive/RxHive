# Ethinyl Estradiol + Desogestrel

**Generic Name:** Ethinyl Estradiol + Desogestrel

**Usage:**

Ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel is a combination birth control pill used to prevent pregnancy.  It's also sometimes prescribed to treat certain conditions related to hormonal imbalances, such as acne or heavy menstrual bleeding, but this is secondary to its primary use as a contraceptive.  The specific formulation (e.g., the dosage of each hormone) will vary depending on the brand and the individual's needs.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed regimen exactly as directed by a healthcare professional.  This typically involves taking one pill daily at the same time each day, for a cycle of 21 or 28 days, followed by a hormone-free period.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Breast tenderness, bloating, weight changes, mood swings, nausea, headaches, spotting or breakthrough bleeding, changes in libido, acne.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, liver problems, gallbladder disease, depression, increased risk of certain cancers (cervical, breast).  The risk of these serious side effects is generally low but increases with age and other risk factors.

**It's crucial to note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, you should consult a healthcare provider immediately.


**How it Works:**

This combination birth control pill works primarily by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen that helps to suppress the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are necessary for ovulation.  Desogestrel is a progestin (synthetic progesterone) that thickens the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and also alters the uterine lining, making it less hospitable for implantation.

**FAQs:**

* **Is it safe to take this pill if I smoke?**  No, smoking significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects, such as blood clots, stroke, and heart attack.  This pill is generally not recommended for women who smoke, especially those over 35 years old.

* **What should I do if I miss a pill?**  The instructions for what to do if you miss a pill will vary depending on the specific brand.  Consult the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication or your doctor or pharmacist.  Missed pills can significantly reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

* **Can I get pregnant while taking this pill?**  While highly effective, this pill is not 100% effective.  There's a chance of pregnancy if pills are missed or taken incorrectly.

* **When should I see my doctor?**  You should schedule regular check-ups with your doctor while taking this medication.  You should also seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe leg pain, sudden severe headache, or vision changes.

* **Can this pill affect my weight?**  Some women experience weight changes (gain or loss) while taking this pill.  The impact varies from person to person.

* **Can this pill treat acne?**  While sometimes used off-label for acne treatment, it's not a primary treatment and the decision to use it for acne should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.
