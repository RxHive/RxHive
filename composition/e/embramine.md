**How it Works:**

Amitriptyline works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, namely serotonin and norepinephrine.  These neurotransmitters play crucial roles in regulating mood, sleep, and pain perception.  By increasing their levels, amitriptyline helps alleviate the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and nerve pain.  The exact mechanism by which it relieves pain is not fully understood.
