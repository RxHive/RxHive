# Enalaprilat

**Generic Name:** Enalaprilat

**Usage:**

Enalaprilat is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure.  It's often used in emergency situations or when rapid blood pressure reduction is needed because it acts quickly compared to its prodrug, enalapril. It can also be used in patients who are unable to take oral medications.  It is administered intravenously (IV).

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** This is a significant risk, especially in patients with already low blood pressure or those taking other blood pressure medications.  Symptoms can include dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting.
* **Dry cough:**  A persistent, dry cough is a relatively common side effect.
* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood):** This is particularly a concern in patients with kidney problems.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by the drop in blood pressure.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Muscle cramps:**

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention.  It can be life-threatening.
* **Kidney problems:**  Enalaprilat can worsen existing kidney problems.
* **Changes in blood counts:**
* **Liver problems:**


**How it Works:**

Enalaprilat is an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor).  It works by blocking the action of ACE, an enzyme that plays a role in raising blood pressure.  By inhibiting ACE, enalaprilat prevents the formation of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels).  Lowering angiotensin II leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and easing the strain on the heart.  It also reduces fluid retention in the body.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is Enalaprilat the same as Enalapril?** A: No, Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of Enalapril.  Enalapril is an oral medication that is converted to Enalaprilat in the body. Enalaprilat is the active form of the drug and is administered directly intravenously.

* **Q: Who shouldn't take Enalaprilat?** A: Patients with a history of angioedema, significant kidney problems, or those who are hypersensitive to ACE inhibitors should not take Enalaprilat.  Pregnant women should also avoid this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience serious side effects like angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), immediately seek medical attention.  For other side effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q: Can Enalaprilat be taken with other medications?** A:  Enalaprilat can interact with many other medications, including diuretics, potassium supplements, and NSAIDs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking before starting Enalaprilat.

* **Q: How long does it take for Enalaprilat to work?** A: The effects of Enalaprilat are typically seen fairly quickly after intravenous administration, but the full therapeutic effect may take longer to develop.
