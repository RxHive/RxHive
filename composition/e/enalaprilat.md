# Enalaprilat
### Generic Name
Enalaprilat

### Usage
Enalaprilat is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in situations where oral medication isn't feasible, such as during an emergency or when a patient is unable to take oral medication.  It's a fast-acting intravenous form of enalapril, offering rapid blood pressure control.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  The dosage of Enalaprilat is highly individualized and depends on the patient's condition and response to treatment.  Generally, for hypertension, an initial intravenous dose of 1.25 mg given over 5 minutes is followed by doses of 1.25 mg every 6 hours, with a maximum dose of 5 mg per dose.  Patients also receiving diuretics may start with a lower dose of 0.625 mg.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment; those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of â‰¤30 mL/min may require a significantly lower starting dose (0.625 mg) and slower titration.  Patients undergoing hemodialysis require specific dosage modifications due to the drug's moderate dialyzability.  Different dosing regimens may also be used for other conditions depending on the needs of the patient.  Always follow the physician's prescribed regimen.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Enalaprilat in children under 16 years of age have not been established, and its use is generally not recommended in this population.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (1-10%) may include:

* Headache
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Nausea

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (<1%), include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, which can be life-threatening)
* Cough (dry, persistent)
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Skin rash
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, immediately consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Enalaprilat works by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).  ACE is involved in the body's regulation of blood pressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels).  By blocking this conversion, Enalaprilat reduces the amount of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and lowering blood pressure.  Additionally, it affects other aspects of blood pressure regulation, such as reducing aldosterone secretion (a hormone that regulates sodium and potassium levels), ultimately improving heart function and protecting the kidneys.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Enalaprilat is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Enalaprilat, enalapril, or any component of the formulation; a history of angioedema related to prior ACE inhibitor use; or idiopathic or hereditary angioedema.

* **Interactions:**  Enalaprilat may interact with several other medications.  The use of diuretics, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), potassium-sparing diuretics, lithium, and gold requires careful monitoring due to potential interactions and increased risk of side effects.  Concurrent use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes and moderate-to-severe renal impairment is contraindicated.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Enalaprilat is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, due to the risk of serious birth defects and fetal injury.  It's also present in breast milk, and the decision to discontinue breastfeeding or Enalaprilat should be made carefully considering the benefit to the mother.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Close monitoring of renal function is particularly important in patients taking NSAIDs concurrently.

* **Other Precautions:**  Enalaprilat should be used with caution in patients with aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, collagen vascular disease, unilateral/bilateral renal artery stenosis, and those undergoing major surgery.  Close monitoring of blood pressure is vital.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Enalaprilat to work?**  A:  Enalaprilat is a fast-acting intravenous medication; its effects are generally seen quickly, but the full effect on blood pressure may take several hours to reach its peak.

* **Q: Can I take Enalaprilat with other medications?** A:  This depends on the specific medication.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking any other medications with Enalaprilat, as interactions may occur.

* **Q: How should I store Enalaprilat?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided with your prescription.  Generally, IV medications have specific storage requirements to maintain their stability and efficacy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If a dose is missed, consult with your doctor or follow their specific instructions.  Do not attempt to make up for a missed dose by doubling the subsequent dose.

* **Q:  Is Enalaprilat safe for long-term use?** A: The long-term safety of Enalaprilat depends on individual factors and response to treatment; close monitoring by a healthcare provider is crucial.
