# Enzalutamide
### Generic Name
Enzalutamide

### Usage
Enzalutamide is primarily used to treat prostate cancer.  Specifically, it's indicated for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), meaning the cancer continues to grow even after the body's testosterone levels have been significantly reduced (through castration or medication).  It's also approved for treating metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC), a more advanced form of the disease where the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and is still responding to reduced testosterone levels.  In both cases, Enzalutamide works by blocking the action of androgens (male hormones), which fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Prostate Cancer):** The typical adult dose is 160 mg orally once daily.  It's crucial to note that patients receiving Enzalutamide should also be concurrently treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or have undergone bilateral orchiectomy (surgical removal of the testicles) to further reduce testosterone levels.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Enzalutamide have not been established in children.  It's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No initial dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is specified in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  For patients with a CrCl of 30â€“89 mL/min, no adjustment is usually necessary.
* **Toxicity Management:** If a patient experiences grade 3 or higher adverse effects or intolerable side effects, the treatment may be withheld until symptoms improve to grade 2 or less, then resumed at the same dose, or reduced to 120 mg or 80 mg daily if necessary.  Severe hypersensitivity reactions, grade 3 or 4 ischemic heart disease, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, or seizures necessitate permanent discontinuation of Enzalutamide.
* **CYP2C8 Inhibitors:** If concomitant use with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors is unavoidable, the Enzalutamide dose should be reduced to 80 mg daily.  The dose should be returned to the previous level once the inhibitor is discontinued.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:** If concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers is unavoidable, the Enzalutamide dose should be increased to 240 mg daily. The dose should be returned to the previous level once the inducer is discontinued.

### How it Works

Enzalutamide is a pure androgen receptor inhibitor.  It works by blocking the androgen receptor, preventing androgens (like testosterone) from binding to it and triggering the growth of prostate cancer cells.  This inhibition prevents the cancer cells from growing and may lead to their death (apoptosis). Unlike some other anti-androgen therapies, Enzalutamide does not have any agonistic activity, meaning it doesn't activate the androgen receptor.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Enzalutamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in women who are or may become pregnant or are breastfeeding.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  Enzalutamide can increase the risk of cardiovascular events (such as ischemic heart disease), falls and fractures, hypersensitivity reactions, PRES, seizures, and embryo-fetal toxicity.  It should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or predisposing factors.

**Drug Interactions:**  Enzalutamide can interact with numerous other drugs.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with any medications you are currently taking.  The drug's metabolism and efficacy can be affected by strong CYP2C8 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Enzalutamide with food?** A: Yes, Enzalutamide can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Enzalutamide?** A: Store Enzalutamide capsules at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Q: Is Enzalutamide safe for women?** A: No, Enzalutamide is not safe for women and is contraindicated in pregnancy or breastfeeding due to the risk of fetal harm.

* **Q:  How long will I need to take Enzalutamide?** A: The duration of treatment will be determined by your healthcare provider based on your individual response to the therapy.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Enzalutamide?** A: The long-term effects of Enzalutamide vary among patients. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is necessary.
