# Enzalutamide

**Generic Name:** Enzalutamide

**Usage:** Enzalutamide is used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  This means it's used in men with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and is no longer responding to hormone therapy (castration). It may be used alone or in combination with other treatments.  It's also sometimes used for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), but this is less common.  The specific usage should always be determined by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  Side Effects can vary in severity from person to person. Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Hot flashes:** Sudden sensations of warmth, often accompanied by sweating.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Decreased appetite:** Loss of interest in food.
* **Edema (swelling):** Swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet.
* **Hypertension (high blood pressure):** Elevated blood pressure.
* **Seizures:** Although rare, this is a serious side effect.
* **Fall risk increased:** Due to fatigue and potential dizziness.
* **Cognitive effects:** Some patients experience confusion or memory problems.


Serious side effects, although less common, can occur. These require immediate medical attention and include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:** Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  Liver function tests should be monitored regularly.


This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:** Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor (ARI).  Androgen receptors are proteins inside prostate cancer cells that bind to male hormones (androgens) like testosterone.  These hormones stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Enzalutamide blocks the androgen receptors, preventing the androgens from binding and thus slowing or stopping the growth of the cancer cells.
