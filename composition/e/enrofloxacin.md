# Enrofloxacin
### Generic Name
Enrofloxacin

### Usage
Enrofloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial infections in animals, particularly in veterinary medicine.  Its primary use is in treating susceptible bacterial infections in dogs, cats, cattle, and poultry.  These infections can affect various systems, including the respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, and skin.  Specific examples include pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin infections (dermatitis), and infections of wounds.  While used extensively in veterinary practice, enrofloxacin is **not** approved for human use in most countries due to potential for adverse effects and the availability of safer alternatives for human infections.

### Dosage
Dosage of enrofloxacin varies significantly depending on the animal species, weight, severity of infection, and the specific formulation (tablet, oral solution, injectable).  It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by a veterinarian precisely.  There is no standardized dosage for children or humans as its use is not approved for them.

**Veterinary Use (Example Dosages - Always consult a vet):**

* **Dogs & Cats (oral):** Dosage typically ranges from 5mg to 10mg per kilogram of body weight once or twice daily, depending on the severity of the infection. This is often given for 7-10 days, but the duration of treatment is determined by the vet.
* **Dogs & Cats (Injectable):**  Injectable formulations are commonly used for severe infections.  The dosage and frequency are again determined by the veterinarian based on the individual animal and infection.
* **Cattle and Poultry:** Dosages vary widely based on species, route of administration (oral, injectable), and the specific infection. Consult with a veterinarian specializing in livestock for appropriate dosage information.

**Note:**  The above are examples only and should not be used for self-medication. Always consult a veterinarian for the correct dosage and duration of treatment for your animal.


### Side Effects
Common side effects in animals can include:

* Gastrointestinal upset (vomiting, diarrhea)
* Loss of appetite
* Lethargy
* Joint pain or swelling (arthropathy – more common in young, growing animals)
* Neurological signs (ataxia, tremors – less common)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Renal (kidney) toxicity
* Liver damage
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

If any adverse effects occur, contact a veterinarian immediately.


### How it Works
Enrofloxacin is a bacteriocidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By blocking these enzymes, enrofloxacin prevents bacterial cells from dividing and multiplying, leading to their death.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Enrofloxacin should not be used in animals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to fluoroquinolones.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Enrofloxacin can interact with certain medications, including antacids, sucralfate, and some calcium-containing products. Consult with a veterinarian about potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of enrofloxacin during pregnancy and lactation in animals has not been fully established.  Use should be carefully considered and only prescribed by a veterinarian when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.
* **Young Animals:**  Enrofloxacin can cause damage to cartilage in young, growing animals.  Its use is generally avoided in young, rapidly developing animals.
* **Renal/Liver Impairment:** Caution is advised in animals with pre-existing kidney or liver disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use enrofloxacin for myself or my child?**  A: No, enrofloxacin is not approved for human use.  Use in humans carries significant risks and safer alternatives are available for human bacterial infections.  Always consult a medical doctor for human health concerns.

* **Q: How should I store enrofloxacin?** A: Store enrofloxacin as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets.

* **Q: What should I do if my pet misses a dose?** A:  Do not give a double dose. Contact your veterinarian for guidance on how to proceed.

* **Q:  Can I stop the medication early if my pet seems better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your veterinarian, even if your pet appears to be recovering. Stopping early can lead to relapse or development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q:  Is enrofloxacin safe for all animals?** A: No,  specific precautions should be considered for certain animal species, pregnant animals, young animals, and animals with pre-existing health conditions. Always consult a veterinarian before using enrofloxacin in any animal.
