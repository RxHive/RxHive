# Edrecolomab
### Generic Name
Edrecolomab

### Usage
Edrecolomab is a monoclonal antibody used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of stage III colorectal cancer (cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes).  It's administered after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.  Currently, its use is primarily limited to this specific indication.  Further research may explore its potential in other cancers expressing the EpCAM antigen.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For colorectal cancer, the typical dosage involves an initial intravenous (IV) dose of 500 mg, followed by monthly 100 mg doses for a total of four months.  This treatment is given after colorectal surgery, ideally within two weeks of the procedure.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of edrecolomab in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

### Side Effects
The following side effects can occur with edrecolomab treatment:

**Common (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Fever

**Less Common (occurring in less than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Flatulence (gas)
* Digestive disorders
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Backache
* Joint pain
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Shivering

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.  Serious allergic reactions can occur.

### How it Works
Edrecolomab is a monoclonal antibody that targets EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule), a protein found on the surface of many cancer cells, including those in colorectal cancer. By binding to EpCAM, edrecolomab can directly kill cancer cells and enhance the body's immune response against them. This dual mechanism of action contributes to its adjuvant effect after surgery.

### Precautions
Edrecolomab is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to edrecolomab or other mouse products (due to its murine origin).  Use caution in patients with:

* Severe immunodeficiency
* Severe infections
* Severe cardiopulmonary disorders
* Significant kidney or liver insufficiency


Close monitoring is crucial during infusion due to the potential for anaphylactic reactions. Emergency equipment and medications should be readily available. A skin test before administration is not typically recommended.

Patients should be aware that edrecolomab may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery.
