# Eribulin Mesylate
### Generic Name
Eribulin Mesylate

### Usage
Eribulin mesylate is primarily used to treat metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with at least two chemotherapies.  It's specifically indicated for patients whose cancer expresses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)  or does not express HER2.  While its primary use is in breast cancer, it also holds approval for the treatment of liposarcoma, a type of soft tissue cancer, that has progressed after other treatments.  In both indications, eribulin is used as a last-line treatment option when other therapies have proven ineffective.


### Dosage

Eribulin mesylate is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage regimens vary based on the specific indication and patient factors,  so it's crucial to follow a physician's instructions carefully.

**Breast Cancer:** The typical dosage is 1.4 mg/m² given as a 2-minute IV infusion on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual tolerance and blood cell counts.

**Liposarcoma:** The recommended dose is also 1.4 mg/m² given as a 2-minute IV infusion on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Similar to breast cancer treatment, adjustments may be required.

There is no oral formulation of eribulin mesylate available. Pediatric dosing is not established, and the drug is not typically used in children.  Precise dosage calculations require consideration of the patient's body surface area (BSA), which is determined using a formula based on height and weight. This calculation is best performed by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Eribulin mesylate, like other cancer therapies, can cause various side effects, ranging in severity.  Common side effects include:

* **Neutropenia:** A decrease in neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), increasing infection risk.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Alopecia (Hair loss):** While not universal, hair loss can occur.
* **Nausea and Vomiting:** These are fairly common, and anti-nausea medications may be prescribed.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty in passing stools.
* **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.
* **Anorexia:** Loss of appetite.
* **Anemia:** Low red blood cell count.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** Low platelet count, increasing bleeding risk.

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), and serious infections.   If you experience any concerning or worsening side effects, immediately consult your doctor.


### How it Works

Eribulin mesylate is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor. Microtubules are essential components of a cell's internal structure, playing a critical role in cell division. Eribulin works by binding to microtubules, preventing their normal function. This disruption interferes with the cell's ability to divide and replicate, leading to cell death, especially in rapidly dividing cancer cells. The drug targets cancer cells selectively, attempting to minimize damage to healthy cells.



### Precautions

* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Eribulin can significantly suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia). Regular blood tests are essential to monitor these levels.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Patients with a known hypersensitivity to eribulin mesylate or any of its components should not use this drug.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions are not fully characterized, potential drug interactions should be discussed with your physician before beginning treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Eribulin mesylate is categorized as pregnancy category D.  It should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks to the fetus.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments might be needed for patients with impaired liver function.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments might be required for patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of eribulin mesylate, requiring careful monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I be on Eribulin Mesylate?**  A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the therapy and your overall health. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment course.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately.  Do not attempt to make up for a missed dose on your own.
* **Q: How is Eribulin Mesylate stored?** A: Follow your pharmacist's instructions for proper storage. Generally, it should be stored at a controlled room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can I drive while on Eribulin Mesylate?** A: Some side effects, such as fatigue and neuropathy, could impair your ability to drive safely.  Follow your doctor's advice.
* **Q: Are there alternative treatments available?** A: Yes, various other cancer treatments exist, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. Your oncologist can discuss the best treatment options for your specific situation.
