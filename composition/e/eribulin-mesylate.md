# Eribulin Mesylate

**Generic Name:** Eribulin Mesylate

**Usage:** Eribulin mesylate is a chemotherapy drug used to treat:

* **Metastatic breast cancer:** Specifically, it's used to treat patients whose disease has progressed after treatment with at least two chemotherapies, including an anthracycline and a taxane (unless unsuitable).
* **Liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma:**  Eribulin is used to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma after prior treatment.


**Side Effects:**  Eribulin mesylate can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can vary in severity from person to person.  Common side effects may include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Neutropenia:** A decrease in white blood cells, increasing the risk of infection.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These can be managed with anti-nausea medication.
* **Alopecia (hair loss):**  This may be temporary.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty having bowel movements.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.
* **Anemia:** Low red blood cell count, leading to fatigue and shortness of breath.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** Low platelet count, increasing the risk of bleeding.

Serious side effects, while less common, can include:

* **Severe infections:** Due to neutropenia.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These require immediate medical attention.
* **Cardiotoxicity:**  Problems with the heart.
* **Fluid retention:**  Swelling in the body.

**How it Works:** Eribulin mesylate is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor.  This means it works by interfering with the function of microtubules, which are essential components of cells.  Microtubules play a crucial role in cell division and other cellular processes.  By disrupting microtubule dynamics, eribulin prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing, ultimately leading to their death.  It is believed to act differently than other microtubule-targeting agents.
