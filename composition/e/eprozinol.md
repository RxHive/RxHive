# Eprozinol
### Generic Name
Eprozinol

### Usage
Eprozinol was a nasal decongestant and, when administered orally, acted as a mucolytic (thinning mucus) or expectorant (helping to expel mucus).  It's important to note that Eprozinol is no longer manufactured and has been discontinued.  Therefore, information provided here is for historical reference only and should not be used for self-treatment.  If you require treatment for nasal congestion or mucus buildup, please consult a healthcare professional for current, safe, and effective treatment options.


### Dosage
Because Eprozinol is discontinued, specific dosage information is unavailable.  Any previously available dosage guidelines are outdated and unreliable.  It's crucial to avoid using outdated information for medication.


### Side Effects
Since Eprozinol is no longer available, a comprehensive list of side effects is not readily accessible.  Any information found from outdated sources might be incomplete or inaccurate.


### How it Works
Eprozinol's mechanism of action involved inhibiting bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways).  It achieved this by acting on histamine H1 receptors.  Importantly, its effects on the airways were independent of the adrenergic system (the system typically associated with adrenaline and its effects).


### Precautions
As Eprozinol is no longer produced, providing current precautions is impossible. Any past precautions would be unreliable and potentially dangerous to rely on.
