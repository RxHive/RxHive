# Ebastine + Montelukast

**Generic Name:** Ebastine/Montelukast

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma symptoms in adults and children (age restrictions may vary depending on formulation and local regulations â€“ always consult a doctor or pharmacist).  It's often prescribed when symptoms aren't adequately controlled by one medication alone. Ebastine is an antihistamine, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely regarding dosage and duration.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in frequency and severity. Some common side effects may include:

* **Ebastine-related:**  Drowsiness, headache, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth.  Less common but more serious effects include abnormal liver function tests.
* **Montelukast-related:** Headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, insomnia,  nervousness, fever. Rare but more serious side effects include  allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), mood changes (including depression, aggression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts), and liver problems.

It is important to note that this is not an exhaustive list and that serious side effects, though rare, are possible.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Ebastine:** This antihistamine works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes many allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itching, and watery eyes.
* **Montelukast:** This leukotriene receptor antagonist blocks the action of leukotrienes, inflammatory chemicals that contribute to asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms.  Leukotrienes cause bronchoconstriction (narrowing of airways), mucus production, and inflammation. By blocking these chemicals, Montelukast helps reduce inflammation and improve breathing.

The combined effect of ebastine and montelukast provides broader symptom control than either medication alone by targeting different aspects of the allergic response.
