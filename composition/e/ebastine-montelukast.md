# Ebastine + Montelukast
### Generic Name
Ebastine + Montelukast

### Usage

Ebastine + Montelukast is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).  It combines two active ingredients: ebastine and montelukast.

* **Ebastine:** This is a second-generation antihistamine.  Antihistamines work by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Ebastine effectively reduces these symptoms.

* **Montelukast:** This is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Leukotrienes are inflammatory substances involved in allergic reactions. By blocking leukotriene receptors, montelukast helps reduce inflammation in the airways and skin, providing further relief from allergy symptoms, particularly nasal congestion and inflammation.

The combination of ebastine and montelukast offers a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of each drug's individual effects.  This makes it particularly effective in managing moderate to severe allergic symptoms. While primarily used for allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria, its use might extend to other allergic conditions under a doctor's guidance.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a physician based on individual needs and the severity of the condition.  There is no standardized, universally applicable dosage.  The medication is typically available in tablet form, specifically designed as a combination of ebastine and montelukast.  Always follow the prescription instructions carefully.  

**Typical Adult Dosage (example only; consult your doctor):**  One tablet once daily, usually in the evening.  

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The use of ebastine and montelukast combination in children requires careful assessment by a pediatrician. There might be specific formulations and dosages available for children based on their age and weight. It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage meticulously.

**IV Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously.  Both ebastine and montelukast are usually taken orally.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Stomach upset
* Fatigue

Less common, but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, might include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
* Liver problems
* Serious skin reactions
* Changes in mood or behavior


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

As explained previously, this combination medication works through a two-pronged approach:

1. **Ebastine blocks histamine receptors:** This prevents histamine from triggering allergic symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose.

2. **Montelukast blocks leukotriene receptors:** This reduces inflammation in the airways and skin, lessening nasal congestion, swelling, and other allergy-related inflammation.

By targeting both histamine and leukotrienes, the combination provides comprehensive relief from allergic symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Individuals with liver or kidney impairment might require dosage adjustments.  Your doctor will assess your condition and determine the appropriate dosage.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Drowsiness is a possible side effect; therefore, avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel drowsy.

* **Children:** Use in children requires careful consideration by a pediatrician.

* **Elderly:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary for older adults.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with alcohol?**  A:  Alcohol may worsen drowsiness; therefore, it's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of effect varies, but relief from symptoms should be noticed within a few hours of taking the medication.
