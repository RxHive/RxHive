# Emtricitabine
### Generic Name
Emtricitabine

### Usage
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) primarily used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection.  It's crucial to understand that emtricitabine is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) medications; it's never administered alone.  This combination approach is vital for effective HIV management and to reduce the risk of drug resistance.  While its primary use is in HIV treatment, it's also used off-label in some cases for non-occupational and occupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP and oPEP respectively), meaning preventative treatment after potential HIV exposure.  These off-label uses require careful medical supervision and are typically implemented in combination with other ARV drugs.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (HIV-1 Infection):**

* **Oral:**  200 mg once daily (OD) in capsule form or 240 mg OD as a solution.  The exact formulation will depend on the individual's needs and physician's recommendation.

**Adult Dosage (Postexposure Prophylaxis):**

* **nPEP (Non-occupational):** 200 mg OD (capsule form) for 28 days, *always* combined with other ARVs (a 3-drug regimen is standard).  Treatment should begin within 72 hours of exposure.
* **oPEP (Occupational):**  The dosage and regimen will vary based on the specific circumstances and will likely involve a combination of other antiretrovirals such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and raltegravir.  Treatment should begin as soon as possible, ideally within 72 hours, and continue for 4 weeks.


**Pediatric Dosage (HIV-1 Infection):**

* **Infants (1 to <3 months):** Oral solution: 3 mg/kg/dose OD
* **Infants (≥3 months), Children, and Adolescents (≤17 years):** Oral solution: 6 mg/kg/dose OD (maximum daily dose: 240 mg). Capsules (200 mg OD) can be used for patients weighing >33 kg who can swallow capsules whole.
* **Adolescents (≥18 years):**  Dosage is the same as adults.

**Pediatric Dosage (Postexposure Prophylaxis):**  Similar to adult PEP, the dosage and regimen are determined on a case-by-case basis, always under medical supervision.  The same weight-based considerations apply as with treatment of HIV-1 infection.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed as emtricitabine is not significantly metabolized by the liver.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary.  Consult a medical professional for specific guidance as it depends on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate.  Adjustments involve reducing frequency and/or amount of medication.  Dialysis patients require specific dosing instructions.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analog that, once inside a cell, is converted into its active form (a triphosphate). This active form then competes with the building blocks of DNA, preventing the HIV virus from replicating its genetic material. By interrupting this process, emtricitabine effectively inhibits the virus's ability to multiply and spread.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to emtricitabine or any of its components.
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of lactic acidosis/hepatomegaly, especially in patients with underlying liver disease.  Risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).  Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B may occur after discontinuation, particularly in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV. Close monitoring of liver function is necessary in these cases.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Consult a physician about potential interactions with other medications, particularly bortezomib (increased risk of peripheral neuropathy) and alpha-interferon (increased risk of lactic acidosis).
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with reduced kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Emtricitabine is a preferred NRTI for pregnant women with HIV, but breastfeeding is contraindicated as the drug enters breast milk.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Emtricitabine is not metabolized by the liver therefore dosage adjustment is generally not required.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take emtricitabine with food?** A: Emtricitabine can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store emtricitabine?** A: Store emtricitabine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking emtricitabine if I feel better?** A: No.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug resistance and a worsening of the infection.  Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with emtricitabine?** A:  Long-term use of emtricitabine, like with other ARVs, can have potential side effects. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial for early detection and management of any issues.
