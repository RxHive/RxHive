# Ecallantide
### Generic Name
Ecallantide

### Usage
Ecallantide is a medication specifically used to treat acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older.  Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder causing swelling in various parts of the body, often affecting the face, extremities, and airways.  Ecallantide works by targeting the underlying mechanisms of HAE attacks, providing rapid relief from the symptoms.  It's currently not indicated for prophylactic use (preventing attacks) but solely for treating acute episodes.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Hereditary Angioedema):**  The typical dose is 30 mg administered subcutaneously (SubQ). This is given as three separate 10 mg injections. If symptoms persist, an additional 30 mg dose may be given within 24 hours. Injections should be spaced at least 2 inches apart.  The recommended needle size is 27 gauge and sites include abdomen, upper arm, or thigh (avoid the area experiencing the angioedema attack).

**Pediatric Dosage (Hereditary Angioedema):**  The safety and efficacy of ecallantide haven't been established for children under 12 years of age. For those 12 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a physician for guidance in such cases.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Vomiting
* Upper abdominal pain
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)
* Anaphylaxis (rare but serious allergic reaction)
* Injection site reactions (bruising, erythema, irritation, pain, itching, hives)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Nasopharyngitis
* Fever


**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Other hypersensitivity reactions (chest discomfort, flushing, pharyngeal edema, rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, throat irritation, wheezing, hypotension)


**Important Note:**  Any significant or concerning side effect warrants immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Ecallantide is a recombinant protein.  It works by selectively and reversibly inhibiting plasma kallikrein, an enzyme involved in the production of bradykinin.  In HAE, excessive bradykinin leads to increased vascular permeability and swelling.  By blocking kallikrein's action, ecallantide reduces bradykinin levels, thus alleviating the symptoms of HAE attacks.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ecallantide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ecallantide or any components of the formulation.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Close monitoring for such reactions is crucial, especially within the first hour after injection. Because symptoms of anaphylaxis can mimic HAE, careful observation is critical.  The development of antibodies to ecallantide is also a possibility.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ecallantide is categorized as pregnancy category C.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  The excretion of ecallantide into breast milk is unknown.  Alternative treatments are recommended for HAE during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Other Precautions:**  Administer ecallantide only via subcutaneous injection by a healthcare professional trained to manage anaphylaxis and hereditary angioedema. Avoid injecting at the site of the HAE attack.


### FAQs

**Q: How quickly does ecallantide work?**
A: Ecallantide typically provides rapid symptom relief, often within a short time after administration. The exact timeframe can vary among patients.

**Q: How is ecallantide stored?**
A: Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product label and packaging provided by the manufacturer.

**Q: Can I use ecallantide to prevent HAE attacks?**
A: No, ecallantide is currently indicated only for treating acute HAE attacks, not for preventing them.

**Q: What should I do if I experience a serious side effect?**
A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects, particularly those suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis.

**Q: Is ecallantide safe for long-term use?**
A: Ecallantide is not intended for long-term use; it is used only to treat acute episodes of hereditary angioedema.  Consult your doctor for guidance on appropriate management strategies for HAE.
