# Efavirenz
### Generic Name
Efavirenz

### Usage
Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with other antiretroviral medications to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and children (at least 3 months old and weighing at least 3.5 kg).  It's crucial to understand that efavirenz is *not* a standalone treatment; it must always be used as part of a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen.  This combination approach helps to suppress the HIV virus and prevent its progression to AIDS.


### Dosage

**Adults (HIV infection):**

* **Oral Tablet or Capsule:** The usual dose is 600 mg once daily, taken with other antiretroviral agents.  A lower dose of 400 mg once daily may be used in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and lamivudine.
* **Oral Solution (30 mg/mL):**  24 mL once daily. Note that the oral solution has lower bioavailability than the tablet or capsule form.

**Children (HIV infection):**  Dosage is weight-based and determined by the physician, taking into consideration the child's age and overall health.  Efavirenz is always used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.  Detailed weight-based dosing information for children aged less than 3 years and those aged 3 years and older is provided in the original data and should be consulted with a healthcare professional.  The medication can be administered either as a tablet/capsule or oral solution depending on the age and weight of the child.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild impairment (Child-Pugh class A), but use should be cautious.  Efavirenz is not recommended for those with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C).
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally needed.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Skin rash
* Increased serum levels of cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides
* Diarrhea
* Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (dizziness, depression, insomnia, anxiety, pain)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Pruritus (itching) and erythema multiforme (a type of skin rash)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase, amylase)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, anorexia
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)

**Rare or Post-Marketing Side Effects (<1%):**

* Severe psychiatric events (agitation, aggressive behavior, psychosis, suicidal ideation, etc.)
* Hepatic failure
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* QT prolongation (on ECG)
* Many other potential side effects are listed in the original data and should be reviewed with a healthcare professional.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  It works by binding to the reverse transcriptase enzyme, a crucial protein used by HIV to replicate itself within the body.  By blocking this enzyme, efavirenz prevents the virus from making copies of its genetic material, thus hindering its ability to multiply and spread.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Efavirenz is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions) to efavirenz or any of its components, and concurrent administration with elbasvir, grazoprevir, or cisapride.
* **Drug Interactions:** Efavirenz can interact with several other medications, including hormonal contraceptives, some antibiotics, and enzyme inducers.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  The use of efavirenz with alcohol may also increase the risk of adverse events.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Efavirenz is a pregnancy Category D drug, meaning there's a risk to the fetus.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only undertaken under close medical supervision.  Efavirenz is present in breast milk, so alternative feeding methods should be considered.
* **Specific Populations:**  Extra caution is needed when using efavirenz in patients with a history of seizures, autoimmune disorders, or liver problems.
* **CNS Effects:** Efavirenz can cause central nervous system side effects. Dosing at bedtime is often recommended to minimize these effects.

### FAQs

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking efavirenz?**  No, it's generally recommended to avoid alcohol consumption while on efavirenz, as this combination can increase the risk of side effects, particularly liver-related issues.
* **How should I store efavirenz?**  Store efavirenz at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **How long will I need to take efavirenz?**  The duration of efavirenz treatment will depend on your overall health, HIV viral load and response to therapy.  This is determined by your physician.  Treatment is generally lifelong.
