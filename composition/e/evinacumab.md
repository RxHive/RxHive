# Evinacumab
### Generic Name
Evinacumab

### Usage
Evinacumab is a medication used in conjunction with other cholesterol-lowering treatments for adults and children aged 12 years and older who have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).  HoFH is a rare, inherited condition causing extremely high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often leading to premature heart disease.  Evinacumab's effectiveness and safety haven't been established for other types of high cholesterol, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).

### Dosage
**Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH):**

* **Adults and children â‰¥12 years:** The recommended dose is 15 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks.  This is always used in combination with other LDL-C lowering therapies.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed according to the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is explicitly stated in the manufacturer's labeling for mild to moderate impairment. For severe impairment, adjustment is unlikely to be necessary as monoclonal antibodies are not typically eliminated through the kidneys.  However, close monitoring is advised.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) and other severe hypersensitivity reactions
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Limb pain
* Flu-like symptoms
* Nasal congestion
* Rhinorrhea (runny nose)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Infusion-related reactions (itching at the injection site, fever, muscle weakness)

**Less Frequent Side Effects (frequency not defined):**

* Transient (temporary) decrease in diastolic blood pressure
* Transient increase in heart rate


**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe reactions, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3).  ANGPTL3 normally blocks the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL), enzymes crucial for breaking down fats in the blood. By inhibiting ANGPTL3, Evinacumab increases the activity of LPL and EL, leading to improved lipid metabolism. This results in lower levels of LDL-C, triglycerides, and even high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.  Evinacumab lowers LDL-C irrespective of the presence of LDL receptors.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Evinacumab is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity (such as anaphylaxis) to the drug or any component of its formulation. There is an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Pregnancy:**  Exposure to Evinacumab during pregnancy may harm the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 5 months after the last dose.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown if Evinacumab is excreted in breast milk.  However, considering it's a type of antibody present in breast milk, a decision about breastfeeding should weigh the risks of infant exposure against the benefits of breastfeeding and the treatment for the mother.
* **Interactions:**  Efgartigimod alfa (a drug used to treat certain autoimmune disorders) may reduce the effectiveness of Evinacumab. Close monitoring is necessary if both medications are used.
* **Missed Dose:**  Administer the missed dose as soon as possible, and then resume the regular 4-weekly schedule from the date of the last dose.
* **Cardiovascular Effects:**  Evinacumab's impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality hasn't been definitively established.


### FAQs
* **Q: How is Evinacumab administered?**
    * A: It's given intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes.  It requires dilution before administration.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?**
    * A: LDL-C lowering can be seen as early as two weeks after starting treatment.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a side effect?**
    * A:  Contact your doctor immediately, especially if you experience any serious or concerning symptoms.
* **Q: Can I take Evinacumab with other medications?**
    * A:  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Some interactions are possible.
* **Q: How should I store Evinacumab?**
    * A:  Follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions for storage.
