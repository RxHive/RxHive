# Ethylmorphine
### Generic Name
Ethylmorphine

### Usage
Ethylmorphine is primarily used to treat dry cough.  It's a derivative of morphine, but unlike morphine, its analgesic (pain-relieving) effects are less pronounced. Its main action is as an antitussive, meaning it suppresses the cough reflex.  While it has been used historically for its mild analgesic properties, this is not its primary or recommended use.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Dry Cough):** The typical adult dosage is 50 mg per day, taken orally. This is usually divided into several doses, administered at least 4 hours apart.  For example, this might be ten 5 mg tablets spread throughout the day.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Pediatric Dosage (Dry Cough):**  For children, the dosage is significantly lower and depends on age and weight.  A common starting point might be one 5 mg tablet per dose, repeated after 6 hours if needed, but the total daily dose should not exceed four 5 mg tablets.  **It is crucial to consult a pediatrician before giving ethylmorphine to a child.** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on the child's age and weight and the severity of their cough.  Never exceed the prescribed dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Individuals with impaired hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) function require careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.  A doctor should always be consulted in such cases.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Respiratory depression (slowed breathing), dependence, withdrawal symptoms, confusion, difficulty urinating, urinary retention, hypotension (low blood pressure), hallucinations, allergic reactions.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as serious, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Ethylmorphine is metabolized in the liver to morphine.  While the exact mechanism of its antitussive action isn't fully understood, it is believed to act on opioid receptors in the central nervous system, suppressing the cough reflex.  The analgesic effects are likely also mediated through opioid receptor interactions, but they are significantly less potent than those of morphine.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ethylmorphine is contraindicated in individuals with respiratory depression, obstructive airway disease (such as asthma or emphysema), acute alcoholism, convulsive disorders, head injuries, coma, and raised intracranial pressure.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The effects of ethylmorphine can be enhanced by alcohol, anesthetics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and antipsychotics. It may interact with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs), potentially causing CNS depression or excitation. Interactions with other drugs are possible; consult your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of ethylmorphine during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Use caution in patients with liver or kidney problems. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Older Adults and Children:** Older adults and children may be more sensitive to the effects of ethylmorphine and require careful dose monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take ethylmorphine?** A:  Ethylmorphine should only be used for a short period as directed by your doctor. Prolonged use can lead to dependence.
* **Q: Can I drive while taking ethylmorphine?** A: Ethylmorphine can cause drowsiness and dizziness. Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience these side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Simply continue with your next scheduled dose.
* **Q: How should I store ethylmorphine?** A: Store ethylmorphine as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture. Keep it out of the reach of children.
