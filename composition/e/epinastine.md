# Epinastine

**Generic Name:** Epinastine

**Usage:**

Epinastine is an antihistamine used to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives).  It's available as both an oral tablet and an ophthalmic solution (eye drops).  The oral form is used to treat sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose/throat/eyes, and itchy skin associated with allergies. The ophthalmic solution is used to treat itching and redness of the eyes caused by allergies.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the formulation (oral or ophthalmic) and individual sensitivity. Common side effects include:

* **Oral:** drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, insomnia (in some cases).  Less common but more serious side effects are possible.
* **Ophthalmic:** stinging or burning sensation in the eye upon application, temporary blurry vision, bitter taste (if some solution drains into the nasal passage).

It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and serious side effects, though rare, are possible.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

Epinastine is a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist.  This means it works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of allergies, such as itching, sneezing, and runny nose. By blocking histamine's effects, epinastine helps to alleviate these symptoms.  The mechanism of action differs slightly between the oral and ophthalmic forms, but the core principle of histamine blockage remains.

**FAQs:**

* **Is epinastine habit-forming?** No, epinastine is not considered habit-forming.
* **Can I take epinastine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Can I drive after taking epinastine?** The oral form can cause drowsiness in some individuals.  Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you experience drowsiness. The ophthalmic solution is less likely to cause drowsiness.
* **How long does it take to work?** The onset of action varies depending on the formulation and individual response.  Oral epinastine may take some time to fully take effect. Ophthalmic epinastine provides relatively quicker relief for eye symptoms.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I use epinastine during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Consult your doctor before using epinastine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The safety of epinastine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.
