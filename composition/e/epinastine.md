# Epinastine
### Generic Name
Epinastine

### Usage
Epinastine is primarily used to relieve the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the sclera—the white part of the eye—caused by an allergic reaction).  It's a topical medication, meaning it's applied directly to the eyes.  While its primary use focuses on alleviating itching, it can indirectly help improve some associated symptoms like redness and discomfort.

### Dosage

**Allergic Conjunctivitis:**

* **Adults and children ≥2 years:** The usual dose is one drop of 0.05% solution in the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).  Treatment should continue throughout the period of allergen exposure, even if symptoms subside.

* **Children <2 years:** The safety and efficacy of epinastine in children under 2 years of age have not been established.  It should not be used in this age group.

**Dosage Forms:** Epinastine is available as an ophthalmic solution (eye drops).

**Administration:**  Before instilling the drops, wash your hands thoroughly. Tilt your head back, gently pull down your lower eyelid to create a pocket, and instill one drop into the pocket.  Avoid touching the tip of the dropper to any surface to prevent contamination.  If using other eye drops, wait at least 5 minutes between applications.  Remove contact lenses before using epinastine and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them.  Do not reinsert contact lenses if your eye is red.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, because epinastine has low systemic absorption (meaning minimal absorption into the bloodstream), dosage adjustment may not be necessary in these cases. Consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Burning sensation in the eyes
* Eye itching
* Follicular conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva with small bumps)
* Ocular hyperemia (redness of the eyes)
* Cough
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Rhinitis (runny nose)
* Sinusitis
* Cold symptoms
* Upper respiratory tract infection

**Less Common Side Effects (<1%):**

* Excessive tearing (lacrimation)

**Serious Side Effects:** While rare, bacterial keratitis (infection of the cornea) is a potential risk associated with using topical ophthalmic medications.  If you experience any unusual eye pain, redness, or vision changes, seek immediate medical attention.

*Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any adverse effects.*


### How it Works

Epinastine is a topical H1-receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, including itching, redness, and swelling. By blocking histamine's action, epinastine reduces these symptoms.  Additionally, it inhibits histamine release from mast cells, further mitigating the allergic response.  While it primarily targets H1 receptors, it also has some affinity for other receptors, although their clinical significance in this context isn't fully established.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer.
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of bacterial keratitis (corneal infection) with topical ophthalmic medications.
* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in contact lens wearers. Contact lenses should be removed before application and reinserted only after a minimum of 10 minutes.  If eye redness persists, do not reinsert the lenses.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Epinastine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are unknown. It's essential to consult your doctor before using epinastine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential drug interactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for epinastine to work?**  A: The onset of action can vary, but many people experience relief from itching within a short time after instilling the drops.

* **Q: Can I use epinastine with other eye drops?** A: Yes, but maintain a 5-minute interval between applications.

* **Q: How should I store epinastine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I use epinastine for other eye conditions?** A: No, epinastine is specifically for treating the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  Do not use it for other eye conditions without consulting a doctor.
