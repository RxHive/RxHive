# Eprosartan

**Generic Name:** Eprosartan Mesylate

**Usage:**

Eprosartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (such as stroke, heart attack, or death) in patients with high blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle).  It may be used alone or in combination with other blood pressure medications.  It's important to note that eprosartan does *not* treat the underlying cause of hypertension; it only manages the symptoms.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, eprosartan can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:**  This is relatively common, especially when starting the medication.
* **Headache:**  Also a frequently reported side effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Upper respiratory tract infection:**  Such as a cold or flu.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** This can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels):**  Especially in patients with kidney problems.
* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice).
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of pre-existing kidney disease.


This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

Eprosartan works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, eprosartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure.  This also reduces the strain on the heart.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking eprosartan?**  It's generally advised to limit alcohol consumption while taking eprosartan, as alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor.
* **Can I take eprosartan if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Eprosartan is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Discuss with your doctor about alternative options.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
* **Can I stop taking eprosartan suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking eprosartan suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dosage if you need to discontinue the medication.
* **Can eprosartan interact with other medications?**  Yes, eprosartan can interact with other medications, particularly potassium supplements, diuretics, and other blood pressure medications. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
