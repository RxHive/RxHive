# Evolocumab
### Generic Name
Evolocumab

### Usage

Evolocumab is a medication used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often referred to as "bad" cholesterol.  It's primarily used as an add-on therapy for people with high cholesterol who haven't reached their cholesterol goals with other treatments like statins and diet changes.  Specifically, its uses include:

* **Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH):** This is a rare, inherited condition causing extremely high cholesterol levels. Evolocumab helps significantly lower cholesterol in these patients, often in combination with other therapies like LDL apheresis (a procedure to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood).

* **Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH):** This is a more common inherited condition leading to high cholesterol. Evolocumab can be used alongside statins and/or other cholesterol-lowering medications to further reduce LDL-C levels.

* **Primary hyperlipidemia:** This refers to high cholesterol levels not caused by an inherited condition. Evolocumab can be used in conjunction with diet and other lipid-lowering therapies to decrease LDL-C.

* **Cardiovascular disease prevention:** In patients with established cardiovascular disease (like heart attack or stroke), evolocumab, used alongside optimized lipid-lowering therapy, helps reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, and the need for procedures to open blocked arteries.


### Dosage

Evolocumab is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and patient response:

* **Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH):**  The usual starting dose is 420 mg once monthly.  This may be increased to 420 mg every two weeks if needed, based on cholesterol levels. For patients undergoing LDL apheresis, the dose is typically 420 mg every two weeks following the apheresis session.

* **Primary hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease prevention:**  The usual dose is either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly.  The choice depends on individual needs and response to treatment.  If a dose is missed, guidance should be sought from a healthcare provider.

* **Pediatric Dosage (≥12 years, ≥40 kg):** For HoFH in children and adolescents, the initial dose is 420 mg once monthly.  The dose can be increased to every two weeks after 12 weeks if needed.  For those receiving apheresis, the dose is 420 mg every 2 or 4 weeks, administered immediately after the procedure.  Use in children should be under the careful supervision of a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (liver problems).  For severe hepatic impairment or renal impairment (kidney problems), consultation with a doctor is necessary.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients) can include:

* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Gastroenteritis (stomach flu)
* Nausea
* Skin rash
* Diabetes mellitus (new onset or worsening of existing diabetes)
* Urinary tract infection
* Bruising
* Influenza (flu)
* Injection site reactions
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Cough
* Sinusitis

Less common, but more serious, side effects include allergic reactions like angioedema (swelling, especially in the face, lips, tongue, or throat), and hypersensitivity reactions.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by targeting a protein called PCSK9.  PCSK9 normally binds to LDL receptors on liver cells, leading to their breakdown and reduced LDL cholesterol removal from the blood. Evolocumab inhibits PCSK9, preventing it from binding to these receptors. This results in more LDL receptors being available to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Evolocumab is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to the drug or its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** While limited interactions have been reported, it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Evolocumab should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.  It is unclear whether the drug is excreted in breast milk.  Mothers should discuss the risks and benefits of breastfeeding with their doctor.

* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of lipid profiles (cholesterol levels) is essential during treatment with evolocumab.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  A decrease in LDL cholesterol is typically observed within 4-12 weeks of starting treatment.

* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A:  Store evolocumab in the refrigerator, unless otherwise specified on the product label. Let it come to room temperature before injection.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking evolocumab?** A: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but consult your doctor for personalized advice.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  There are specific recommendations based on the dosing schedule.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: Long-term studies are ongoing, but currently available data suggest evolocumab is generally well-tolerated.  However, regular monitoring of cholesterol levels and any adverse events is essential.
