# Eslicarbazepine
### Generic Name
Eslicarbazepine

### Usage
Eslicarbazepine is primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy.  This means it works best when used *in addition* to other anti-seizure medications, not as a standalone treatment.  While not its primary indication, some studies suggest potential benefits in treating certain types of focal seizures.  It's crucial to understand that eslicarbazepine is not effective for all types of seizures and should only be used under the guidance of a neurologist or epilepsy specialist.  They will determine the appropriate use based on the individual's specific seizure type and overall health.


### Dosage

Dosage of eslicarbazepine is individualized and carefully adjusted by a doctor based on the patient's response and tolerability.  It's typically started at a low dose and gradually increased over time.

**Oral Administration (Tablets):**

* **Adults:** The usual starting dose is 400mg once daily. This may be increased gradually to a maximum of 1200mg daily, usually divided into two doses. The increase in dosage should be carefully monitored for side effects.
* **Children:**  Eslicarbazepine is not typically used in children due to a lack of sufficient data on its safety and efficacy in this population.

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:**

* Eslicarbazepine is not available in intravenous form.  Treatment is exclusively oral.


Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with kidney or liver impairment.  The doctor will make these adjustments based on the specific patient's medical profile.  It's vital to follow the doctor's prescribed dosage regimen exactly as instructed.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of eslicarbazepine, generally mild and often resolving with continued use, include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Diplopia (double vision)
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (this is a rare but serious side effect associated with many anti-seizure medications)
* Serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Liver problems

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Eslicarbazepine is believed to work by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in the brain. These channels are crucial for the transmission of nerve impulses. By blocking these channels, eslicarbazepine reduces the abnormal electrical activity that causes seizures.  This action helps to stabilize neuronal firing and prevent the spread of excessive electrical activity leading to seizure onset.  The precise mechanisms by which it achieves this effect are still under investigation.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with a known allergy to eslicarbazepine or any of its ingredients should avoid this medication.
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with liver or kidney disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of eslicarbazepine during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Its use should be carefully considered and weighed against the risks.  Consultation with a healthcare provider is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:** Eslicarbazepine can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Drowsiness and dizziness are common side effects.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  As with other anti-epileptic drugs, thereâ€™s a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.  Close monitoring is crucial, particularly in individuals with a history of depression or suicidal tendencies.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking eslicarbazepine suddenly?**  A: No, you should never stop taking eslicarbazepine suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to worsening seizures.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce the dosage to minimize the risk of withdrawal effects.

* **Q: How should I store eslicarbazepine?** A: Store eslicarbazepine tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep them out of reach of children.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking eslicarbazepine?** A:  Alcohol can interact with eslicarbazepine and worsen side effects, such as drowsiness. It's best to avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is eslicarbazepine addictive?** A: Eslicarbazepine is not considered an addictive substance. However, it's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and not discontinue it without your doctor's guidance.
