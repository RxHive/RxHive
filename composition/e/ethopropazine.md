# Ethopropazine
### Generic Name
Ethopropazine (also known as Profenamine)

### Usage
Ethopropazine is primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).  Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder causing tremors, rigidity, slow movement, and postural instability. Drug-induced EPS are movement disorders that can occur as a side effect of certain medications, particularly antipsychotics. Ethopropazine helps alleviate these movement problems by impacting the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Parkinsonism (Oral):**  Treatment typically starts with 50 mg three times daily (TID). The dose can be gradually increased by 50-100 mg/day every 2-3 days, until optimal benefit is achieved or side effects become intolerable. The usual daily dose ranges from 100 to 500 mg, divided into two or three doses.

**Drug-induced Extrapyramidal Reactions (Oral):** A common starting dose is 100 mg twice daily (BID), often providing adequate symptom control.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult your doctor if you have liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Headache
* Nausea and vomiting
* Dry mouth, nose, or throat
* Decreased sweating

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, require immediate medical attention.  These can include severe hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and gastrointestinal issues like severe nausea, vomiting, or epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen).

**Important:** If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Ethopropazine is an anticholinergic medication. It works by partially blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain. In Parkinson's disease, there's an imbalance between acetylcholine and dopamine (another neurotransmitter). By reducing the activity of acetylcholine, ethopropazine helps restore a better balance, lessening the symptoms of Parkinsonism and drug-induced EPS.  It also affects other neurotransmitters and receptors, contributing to its overall effect.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ethopropazine should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to ethopropazine, phenothiazines, or related compounds; those with cardiovascular instability; or those with glaucoma.

**Increased Risk:**  Ethopropazine may increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia (a serious movement disorder),  increase intraocular pressure (potentially worsening glaucoma), trigger an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma, and worsen existing conditions like hypertension (high blood pressure), myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disorder), urinary retention, and prostatic hypertrophy (enlarged prostate).

**Cautious Use:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease, prostatic hypertrophy, pyloric obstruction (blockage in the stomach), or pre-existing mental disorders.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ethopropazine should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks to the fetus.  The excretion of ethopropazine in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution is advised if breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ethopropazine with food?** A: Yes, ethopropazine may be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store ethopropazine?** A: Store ethopropazine as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ethopropazine suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking ethopropazine suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?** A: Yes, ethopropazine can interact with other medications.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
