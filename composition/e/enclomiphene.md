# Enclomiphene

**Generic Name:** Enclomiphene citrate

**Usage:** Enclomiphene citrate is primarily used to treat female infertility caused by anovulation (failure to release an egg). It is an ovulation stimulant.  It is also being explored for other uses, such as improving athletic performance (though this is off-label and not supported by sufficient research).

**Side Effects:**  Like many medications, enclomiphene can cause side effects, although they don't occur in everyone.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Hot flashes, headaches, mood swings, ovarian enlargement, visual disturbances (blurred vision, light sensitivity), nausea, vomiting.
* **Less common, but serious side effects:** Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) â€“ a potentially life-threatening condition involving significant ovarian swelling,  blood clots, stroke.
* **Rare side effects:** Allergic reactions.


**How it Works:** Enclomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  It works by blocking the action of estrogen in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This blockage reduces the negative feedback loop that normally inhibits the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Increased GnRH leads to increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, stimulating follicular growth and ovulation. Essentially, it tricks the body into thinking estrogen levels are low, thus triggering the process of ovulation.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is enclomiphene citrate the same as clomiphene citrate?** A:  While both are SERMs used for ovulation induction, enclomiphene citrate is considered a more selective and potentially less harsh medication than clomiphene citrate.  However, more research is needed to definitively confirm this.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The response varies greatly between individuals.  Ovulation may occur within a few weeks of starting treatment, but it can take several cycles.

* **Q: What are the risks of multiple pregnancies?** A:  The risk of multiple pregnancies (twins or higher) is significantly increased when using enclomiphene citrate, similar to clomiphene citrate.  Close monitoring is essential.

* **Q:  Is enclomiphene citrate suitable for all women with infertility?** A:  No.  It is not suitable for women with certain conditions, such as unexplained infertility, tubal problems, or severe endometriosis.  A doctor should assess suitability based on individual factors.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A:  Yes, potential interactions exist. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before taking enclomiphene citrate.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood due to limited long-term studies.  However, potential long-term risks need to be considered and discussed with a physician.
