# Enclomiphene
### Generic Name
Enclomiphene

### Usage

Enclomiphene is primarily used to treat infertility in women and secondary hypogonadism (low testosterone) in men.  In women, it works by stimulating the release of hormones necessary for ovulation, helping to restore fertility in those experiencing ovulatory dysfunction. In men, it helps to increase testosterone production by acting on the pituitary gland, which regulates hormone release.  While its primary use is in these two specific conditions, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other areas.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.

**Female Infertility/Secondary Hypogonadism (Women):**  Treatment typically begins with an oral dose of 12.5 mg once daily.  The dose may be increased to 25 mg daily if needed, based on individual response and medical advice.

**Secondary Hypogonadism (Men):**  Dosage recommendations for men are not explicitly available in the current information.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on individual factors and hormone levels.  

**Important Note:**  Enclomiphene is only available with a prescription.  The dosage should always be determined and adjusted by a physician based on the individual's specific needs and response to treatment.  Self-medicating is dangerous and should be avoided.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Bloating
* Hot flashes
* Ovarian enlargement
* Metrorrhagia (irregular menstrual bleeding)
* Breast discomfort

Less common but more serious side effects may occur. It's crucial to seek immediate medical attention if you experience anything unusual or concerning.


### How it Works

Enclomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  In women, it works by blocking the effects of estrogen in certain areas of the body, which in turn triggers the pituitary gland to release more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones are essential for the development and release of eggs (ovulation). In men with secondary hypogonadism, it stimulates the pituitary gland to release more luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to increased testosterone production in the testes.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Enclomiphene is contraindicated during pregnancy because it could harm the developing fetus.  Effective contraception is essential during treatment.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unclear whether enclomiphene is excreted in breast milk. Use should be carefully considered and only with medical supervision.  It may also decrease lactation.
* **Liver Disease:** Individuals with liver problems should use caution, as the drug is metabolized by the liver.
* **Drug Interactions:** Enclomiphene might interact with other medications. It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're taking.
* **Visual Disturbances:** Some individuals have reported visual disturbances; if this occurs, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.
