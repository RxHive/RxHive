# Ebastine
### Generic Name
Ebastine

### Usage

Ebastine is a non-sedating antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergic conditions.  Its main uses include:

* **Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever):** Ebastine effectively reduces symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and eyes, and nasal congestion.
* **Allergic Dermatitis (Eczema):** It helps alleviate itching and rash associated with allergic skin reactions.
* **Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (Hives):** Ebastine can lessen the severity and frequency of hives, characterized by itchy welts on the skin.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**

* **Allergic Rhinitis:** The usual dose is 10 mg once daily.  For more severe symptoms, a dose of 20 mg once daily may be more effective.
* **Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria & Allergic Dermatitis:**  The typical dose is 10 mg once daily.

**Pediatric Dosage (Oral - Tablet or Syrup):**

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and based on the child's weight and age.  Generally:

* **Ages 2-5 years:** 2.5 mg once daily
* **Ages 6-11 years:** 5 mg once daily
* **Ages 12 years and older:**  Same as adult dosage


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver problems):**  For adults with mild to moderate liver impairment, the maximum dose is 10mg once daily. Ebastine is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment.  For children, dose adjustment in mild to moderate liver impairment should be based on adult experience, but it is contraindicated in those with severe impairment.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney problems):** No dose adjustment is usually needed for patients with kidney problems.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Dry mouth (Xerostomia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) â€“ this can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms.
* Ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes) - serious irregular heartbeats.
* Other less common side effects reported include headache, malaise, numbness, constipation, diarrhea, and various other symptoms affecting different body systems.

**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, skin rashes, and various other symptoms.


**Important Note:** If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ebastine is an H1 receptor antagonist. Histamine is a substance released by the body during allergic reactions.  It causes inflammation and the typical symptoms of allergies. Ebastine works by blocking the histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing these symptoms. This helps to alleviate itching, sneezing, runny nose, and other allergic reactions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ebastine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to ebastine or any component of the formulation, those with severe hepatic impairment, and children under 2 years of age.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, or erythromycin can increase ebastine levels and potentially prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of heart rhythm abnormalities.  Concomitant use is avoided.  Caution is also warranted with macrolide antibiotics, systemic imidazole antifungals, and class I and III antiarrhythmics.
* **QT Prolongation:** Ebastine can prolong the QT interval on an ECG. This is a risk factor for potentially dangerous heart rhythm disturbances.  Extra caution is needed in patients with pre-existing conditions that may prolong the QT interval, such as congenital long QT syndrome, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of ebastine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using ebastine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use caution in patients with reduced liver function.  Refer to dosage adjustments section.
