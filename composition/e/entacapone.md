# Entacapone
### Generic Name
Entacapone

### Usage
Entacapone is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease.  Specifically, it's employed as an *adjunct therapy* to levodopa/carbidopa. This means it works best when combined with these other medications.  Its primary role is to manage the "wearing-off" effect often experienced by Parkinson's patients towards the end of their levodopa/carbidopa dose.  This "wearing-off" refers to a return of Parkinson's symptoms before the next dose is due. Entacapone helps to extend the period of symptom relief provided by levodopa/carbidopa.  It does not replace levodopa/carbidopa; it enhances its effectiveness.

### Dosage
Entacapone is administered orally.  The standard dosage for adults with Parkinson's disease is 200 mg taken with each dose of levodopa/carbidopa.  The maximum daily dose is 1600 mg (8 x 200mg).  The exact dosage regimen is determined by a doctor and may be adjusted based on individual response and tolerance.  There are no established dosage recommendations for children, as the safety and efficacy of entacapone in pediatric patients haven't been determined.  For individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, dosage adjustments aren't routinely recommended by the manufacturer, but close monitoring is crucial.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10%):

* Nausea
* Dyskinesia (involuntary movements)

Less common side effects (1-10%):

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Anxiety
* Drowsiness

* Hallucinations
* Syncope (fainting)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

Rare but serious side effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):

* Behavioral changes (including psychotic-like behavior)
* Hepatitis (mostly cholestatic)
* Impulse control disorders (e.g., pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive spending)
* Mental status changes
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like symptoms (high fever, confusion, etc.)
* Retroperitoneal fibrosis (scarring of tissue behind the abdomen)
* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
* Sudden onset of sleep
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring)

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Entacapone works by inhibiting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that breaks down levodopa.  By blocking COMT's activity, entacapone allows more levodopa to reach the brain, extending its therapeutic effects and reducing the "wearing-off" phenomenon in Parkinson's disease.  In simpler terms, it helps the levodopa work for longer, providing more consistent relief from Parkinson's symptoms.


### Precautions
Entacapone is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to entacapone or any of its components, and those concurrently taking non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  It should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Lower gastrointestinal diseases or increased risk of dehydration.
* Cardiovascular disease (including history of heart attack or arrhythmias).
* Hepatic or biliary impairment.
* Pre-existing sleep disorders.

Entacapone may interact with other medications, including other drugs metabolized by COMT, dopamine agonists, selegiline, amantadine, and CNS depressants.  It can also potentiate the orthostatic hypotension caused by levodopa.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  The use of entacapone during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take entacapone without levodopa/carbidopa?** A: No, entacapone is only used as an adjunct therapy with levodopa/carbidopa and is not effective on its own.

* **Q: How should I store entacapone?** A: Store entacapone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking entacapone?** A: It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking entacapone, as it may increase the risk of side effects, particularly drowsiness.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience dark urine?** A: Dark, brownish-orange urine is a common, harmless side effect of entacapone.

* **Q: Can I stop taking entacapone suddenly?** A:  No, sudden discontinuation should be avoided as it may lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.
