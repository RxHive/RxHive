# Entacapone

**Generic Name:** Entacapone

**Usage:** Entacapone is used in combination with levodopa/carbidopa (SinemetÂ® and generic equivalents) to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.  It's specifically used to help reduce "wearing-off" effects, where the benefits of levodopa/carbidopa lessen before the next dose is due.  This means it helps to extend the duration of symptom relief provided by levodopa/carbidopa. It is *not* used alone.

**Side Effects:**  Entacapone can cause a variety of side effects, some common and some rare.  Common side effects include:

* **Darkening of urine:** This is usually harmless and temporary.
* **Nausea:** Can be mild to moderate.
* **Diarrhea:** Can range in severity.
* **Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing):** Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Drowsiness:**  May affect alertness.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Liver problems:**  Rare but potentially serious.  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), abdominal pain, and dark urine.
* **Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown):** A rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Symptoms may include muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine.
* **Dyspnea (shortness of breath):**  Difficulty breathing.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms can vary widely, from rash to anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).


**How it Works:** Entacapone works by inhibiting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme that breaks down levodopa. By inhibiting COMT, entacapone allows more levodopa to reach the brain, where it's converted into dopamine. This helps to improve the effectiveness and duration of action of levodopa in treating Parkinson's disease symptoms.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take entacapone by itself?**  A: No, entacapone must be taken in combination with levodopa/carbidopa. It does not work effectively alone.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as liver problems, rhabdomyolysis, or allergic reactions.  For less serious side effects, discuss them with your doctor to determine if adjustments are necessary.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, entacapone can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q:  Is entacapone safe for everyone?** A:  No.  People with certain medical conditions, such as liver disease, should not take entacapone.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.
