# Ethinyl Estradiol + Etonogestrel
### Generic Name
Ethinyl Estradiol + Etonogestrel

### Usage
Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is a combination birth control pill used primarily for contraception.  It prevents pregnancy by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening the cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg), and altering the uterine lining (making it less hospitable for implantation).  While its primary use is preventing pregnancy, some formulations may also be prescribed to manage certain menstrual irregularities, such as heavy bleeding or painful periods.  However, it's crucial to understand that this medication is solely for contraception and menstrual regulation; it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).


### Dosage
Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is available in various formulations, each with its specific dosage of both hormones.  The dosage is determined by the prescribing physician based on individual factors.  The medication is typically taken orally, one pill daily at approximately the same time each day.  There is no IV formulation.  

**Oral Dosage:**  The specific dosage (mcg of ethinyl estradiol and mcg of etonogestrel) will be clearly stated on the prescription and packaging. It's crucial to follow the instructions precisely, as provided by your doctor or pharmacist. Skipping pills or inconsistent dosing can significantly reduce the effectiveness of the medication.  Most regimens follow a 21-day cycle with a 7-day break for menstruation, followed by starting the next pack. Some regimens are 28-day packs with placebo pills for the last week.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for your specific brand and formulation.

**Pediatric Use:** This medication is generally not indicated for use in children who have not reached puberty.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Breast tenderness
*   Headaches
*   Nausea
*   Mood changes (including depression)
*   Weight changes (gain or loss)
*   Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
*   Changes in libido

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:

*   Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
*   High blood pressure
*   Stroke
*   Heart attack
*   Liver problems
*   Gallbladder disease

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.  This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  Consult your healthcare provider if you have concerns about any side effects.


### How it Works
Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen, and etonogestrel is a synthetic progestin.  This combination works by suppressing the hormones involved in the menstrual cycle, primarily luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This suppression prevents ovulation.  The progestin also thickens cervical mucus, creating a barrier for sperm.  Additionally, it may also alter the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.


### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with certain medical conditions such as a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, liver disease, or unexplained vaginal bleeding.  It's also contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with several other drugs, including some antibiotics and anticonvulsants.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
*   **Specific Warnings:**  Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious side effects, including blood clots and heart problems, when using combination oral contraceptives.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not use this medication.  Older adults should consult with a physician prior to using this medication. Individuals with a family history of blood clots or heart disease should also consult their doctor. Regular check-ups are recommended while using this medication.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I skip a pill?** A: No. Skipping pills can reduce the effectiveness of the medication and increase the risk of pregnancy. If you miss a pill, follow the instructions provided in the medication leaflet.
*   **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the pills at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
*   **Q: Does this protect against STIs?** A: No. This medication only prevents pregnancy and does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.  You must use barrier methods (condoms) for STI protection.
*   **Q: How long does it take to be effective?** A:  It typically takes about seven days of consistent use for the medication to be fully effective for pregnancy prevention.  However, it is crucial to use additional contraceptive methods until the medication takes full effect.  Follow your doctor's instructions.
