# Ethinyl Estradiol + Etonogestrel

**Generic Name:** Ethinyl Estradiol + Etonogestrel

**Usage:**  Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel is a combination birth control pill used to prevent pregnancy.  It may also be used to treat symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), reduce acne in women, and regulate menstrual cycles.  Specific uses and dosages should be determined by a healthcare provider.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:**  Breast tenderness, bloating, nausea, weight changes, mood changes (including depression), headaches, changes in menstrual bleeding (e.g., spotting, breakthrough bleeding, amenorrhea), decreased libido.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, gallbladder disease, liver tumors (rare), increased risk of cervical cancer (although this risk is debated and likely related to other factors), changes in cholesterol levels.
* **Other:**  Acne, changes in skin pigmentation, vaginal dryness, yeast infections.

This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult a healthcare professional for a complete understanding of potential side effects.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, leg pain, vision changes, or severe abdominal pain.


**How it Works:** This combination pill works by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen, and etonogestrel is a synthetic progestin.  Together, they thicken the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg, and they also alter the uterine lining, making it less receptive to a fertilized egg.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this pill right for me?** A:  Whether this pill is right for you depends on your individual health history and needs.  Your doctor will assess your risk factors and determine if this is an appropriate birth control method for you.  Certain conditions, such as a history of blood clots, smoking, high blood pressure, or certain types of cancer, may make this pill unsuitable.

* **Q: When should I take the pill?** A:  Follow the directions on your prescription carefully.  Most combination pills are taken daily at approximately the same time each day.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a pill?** A:  Missing pills can reduce the effectiveness of the birth control. Refer to the patient information leaflet that accompanies your medication or consult your doctor or pharmacist for instructions on what to do if you miss a pill.  There may be different instructions depending on how many pills you've missed and which point in the cycle you're at.

* **Q: Does this pill protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?** A: No, this pill does not protect against STIs.  You should practice safe sex and use condoms to prevent STIs.

* **Q: Can I stop taking the pill at any time?** A: You can stop taking the pill, but you should discuss this with your doctor first.  Stopping suddenly may result in irregular bleeding.
