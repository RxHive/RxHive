# Ethinyl Estradiol + Gestodene

**Generic Name:** Ethinyl Estradiol / Gestodene

**Usage:**

Ethinyl estradiol and gestodene is a combination birth control pill used to prevent pregnancy.  It works by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickening the cervical mucus to make it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and changing the lining of the uterus to make it less likely for a fertilized egg to implant.  It may also be prescribed off-label to treat certain conditions related to hormonal imbalances, though this should only be done under the guidance of a physician.  **It is crucial to understand that this medication is ONLY for preventing pregnancy unless specifically prescribed otherwise by a doctor.**


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Changes in menstrual bleeding:**  This can range from lighter or heavier bleeding to spotting between periods, or even amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) in some users.
* **Breast tenderness:**  Many women experience breast tenderness or swelling.
* **Headaches:**  Some women experience headaches, migraines, or mood changes.
* **Nausea:**  Nausea and vomiting are possible, though often less severe with newer formulations.
* **Weight changes:**  Some women gain or lose weight.
* **Mood swings:**  Changes in mood, including irritability or depression, are reported by some users.
* **Decreased libido:**  A decrease in sexual desire is a possible side effect.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Blood clots:** This is a serious risk, and women with a history of blood clots or certain risk factors should not use this medication.
* **High blood pressure:** Regular blood pressure monitoring is recommended while taking this medication.
* **Heart attack or stroke:** Although rare, these are potential serious side effects.
* **Liver problems:**  Liver function tests may be recommended, particularly if you have pre-existing liver conditions.
* **Gallbladder disease:**  Increased risk is possible.
* **Depression:**  While mood swings are common, some users may experience more severe depression.


**How it Works:**

This combination pill contains two hormones: ethinyl estradiol (an estrogen) and gestodene (a progestin).  These hormones work together to suppress the hormonal processes that lead to ovulation and implantation of a fertilized egg.  Specifically:

* **Ethinyl estradiol:** Suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), preventing the ovaries from releasing an egg.
* **Gestodene:** Thickens cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and alters the uterine lining to make implantation less likely.


**FAQs:**

* **How effective is it?** When taken correctly, ethinyl estradiol/gestodene is highly effective at preventing pregnancy (greater than 99% effective). However, human error in taking the pill regularly reduces its effectiveness.
* **What if I miss a pill?**  Refer to the patient information leaflet included with your prescription for specific instructions on what to do if you miss a pill.  Missing pills can reduce effectiveness.
* **Can I take this pill if I smoke?** Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious side effects, especially blood clots.  This combination should generally be avoided if you smoke, especially if you are over 35 years old.
* **Can I take this pill if I have other health conditions?** You should discuss any existing health conditions with your doctor before starting this medication, as it may not be suitable for everyone.
* **When should I see my doctor?** You should see your doctor if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, such as severe headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, or vision changes.  Regular check-ups are recommended while taking this medication.
* **Can I get pregnant while taking this pill?**  While highly effective, it's not 100% effective.  Consistent use as directed is crucial.  If you suspect pregnancy, seek medical advice immediately.
