# Euphorbia Prostrata Extract + Lidocaine
### Generic Name
Euphorbia Prostrata Extract + Lidocaine  (Note: This combination is not a formally approved generic medication with a single, universally recognized name.  The information below reflects the properties of each component used together.)

### Usage

This combination is not a standard pharmaceutical product with FDA approval. Its use is primarily found in topical preparations, often in traditional or folk medicine practices.  Euphorbia prostrata extract, a plant extract, has been traditionally used for various skin conditions, including wounds, rashes, and fungal infections, due to its purported antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.  Lidocaine, a well-established anesthetic, is added to alleviate pain and discomfort associated with the application and any existing skin irritation.  **It is crucial to understand that the efficacy and safety of this combination are not scientifically proven through rigorous clinical trials.**  Use should only be under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional who is familiar with the traditional applications and potential risks.

### Dosage

There is no standardized dosage for a combined Euphorbia prostrata extract and lidocaine topical preparation.  The concentration of each component and the application method will vary greatly depending on the specific formulation and the practitioner's judgment.  Dosage information must be obtained directly from the prescribing healthcare professional.  **Self-medication with this combination is strongly discouraged.**

### Side Effects

* **Euphorbia Prostrata Extract:**  Potential side effects are not well-documented due to limited scientific research.  Skin irritation, allergic reactions (including contact dermatitis), and potential photosensitivity are possible.
* **Lidocaine:** Common side effects are usually mild and localized, including: burning or stinging at the application site, redness, and swelling.  Rare but serious side effects, particularly with systemic absorption, may include dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, and cardiovascular problems.  Allergic reactions are possible.

**Note:** If you experience any unexpected or worsening side effects after using a topical preparation containing Euphorbia prostrata extract and lidocaine, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works

Euphorbia prostrata extract's purported mechanism of action is not fully elucidated scientifically. It is believed to possess antimicrobial properties that may help fight against bacteria and fungi, and anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce swelling and inflammation.  Lidocaine acts as a local anesthetic, blocking nerve impulses to reduce pain and discomfort at the application site.  When combined, the aim is to provide both antimicrobial/anti-inflammatory treatment and pain relief.
