# Evogliptin
### Generic Name
Evogliptin

### Usage
Evogliptin is a medication used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It works as an adjunct to diet and exercise, meaning it's most effective when combined with lifestyle changes.  It can be used as monotherapy (the sole medication for diabetes) or in combination with other diabetes medications, most commonly metformin.  Evogliptin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.


### Dosage
**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus):** The usual oral dose is 5 mg once daily.  The maximum recommended dose is also 5 mg per day.  Concomitant use with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) is generally avoided due to a lack of demonstrated additional benefit in lowering blood sugar.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Evogliptin in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment, and Evogliptin should generally be avoided in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.  Use in patients with hepatic impairment should also be approached cautiously.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Toothache
* Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Contact dermatitis (skin rash)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)

Less common but serious side effects include acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), bullous pemphigoid (a blistering skin condition), severe arthralgia, and angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  Always consult your healthcare provider if you experience any concerning symptoms.


### How it Works
Evogliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretin hormones, GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide).  These incretin hormones play a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels by stimulating insulin release from the pancreas when blood glucose is elevated and suppressing glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar). By inhibiting DPP-4, Evogliptin increases the levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, leading to improved glucose control.  Other effects include increased glycogen storage (glucose storage form in the liver and muscles) and decreased gastric emptying.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Evogliptin is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity (such as anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Evogliptin or other DPP-4 inhibitors, those with diabetic ketoacidosis, and those with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

**Warnings:**  Increased risk of acute pancreatitis, bullous pemphigoid, severe and disabling arthralgia, and hypoglycemia has been observed.  Use caution in patients with hepatic or moderate-to-severe renal impairment, a history of pancreatitis, or NYHA class I heart failure.

**Drug Interactions:**  Evogliptin may interact with several other medications, including alpha-lipoic acid, androgens, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, direct-acting antiviral agents for HCV, guanethidine, hyperglycemia-associated agents, hypoglycemia-associated agents, insulins, sulfonylureas, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pegvisomant, and prothionamide.  These interactions may lead to increased or decreased efficacy or increased risk of side effects.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Other medications are preferred for managing diabetes during pregnancy.  The excretion of Evogliptin in breast milk is unknown; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
