# Emtricitabine + Rilpivirine + Tenofovir
### Generic Name
Emtricitabine/Rilpivirine/Tenofovir

### Usage
This combination medication is a complete regimen for treating HIV-1 infection in treatment-naive adult patients.  It's specifically indicated for adults with an HIV-1 RNA viral load of 100,000 copies/mL or less.  This triple combination therapy is designed to suppress HIV replication, helping to improve the immune system and reduce the risk of HIV-related complications.  It is not recommended for patients with higher viral loads or significantly lower CD4 counts.


### Dosage
The standard adult dosage is one tablet of Emtricitabine (200 mg)/Rilpivirine (25 mg)/Tenofovir (25 mg) once daily.  This should be taken orally with food.

**Children and Adolescents:**  For children aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg, the dosage is also one tablet daily.  This combination is not recommended for younger children or those weighing less than 35 kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of renal impairment.  For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 mL/min or greater, no adjustment is typically needed.  However, it is not recommended for individuals with a CrCl below 30 mL/min.  In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, one tablet should be taken once daily *after* hemodialysis on dialysis days.  For patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary; however, it hasn't been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

*   Headache
*   Sleep disorders
*   Abnormal dreams
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Flatulence
*   Decreased bone mineral density

Less common but serious side effects can also occur.  These include changes in cholesterol and triglyceride levels,  hepatotoxicity,  and hypersensitivity reactions.  Always report any concerning side effects to your healthcare provider.


### How it Works
This medication combines three different antiretroviral drugs that work through distinct mechanisms to combat HIV:

*   **Emtricitabine and Tenofovir:** These are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). They work by interfering with the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which HIV uses to convert its RNA into DNA, thus preventing the virus from replicating.

*   **Rilpivirine:** This is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).  It also inhibits reverse transcriptase but through a different mechanism than the NRTIs.  By using different mechanisms, the combination provides broader and more effective inhibition of viral replication.


### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:**  This combination should not be used concurrently with several medications, including carbamazepine, certain types of corticosteroids, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), rifampin, rifapentine, and St. John's wort.
*   **Interactions:**  Interactions can occur with antacids, rifabutin, azole antifungals, H2 receptor antagonists, macrolide antibiotics, and methadone.  Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking.
*   **Hepatitis B Coinfection:**  Patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B virus should be carefully monitored, as severe hepatitis B exacerbations may occur upon discontinuation of the medication.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While this combination is an option for pregnant women with HIV, breastfeeding is not recommended.  Consult your healthcare provider for specific advice.
*   **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Kidney and liver function should be monitored, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take this medication with other drugs?** A:  It's crucial to discuss all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) with your doctor or pharmacist to avoid potential drug interactions.

*   **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
