# Edaravone
### Generic Name
Edaravone

### Usage
Edaravone is primarily used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.  Edaravone's role is to slow the progression of the disease, not to cure it.  Currently, there are no other approved uses for edaravone.


### Dosage
Edaravone is available in both intravenous (IV) and oral forms.  Dosage varies depending on the route of administration and the treatment cycle.

**Intravenous (IV):**

* **Initial Cycle:** 60 mg administered over 60 minutes daily for 14 days, followed by a 14-day drug-free period.
* **Subsequent Cycles:** 60 mg administered over 60 minutes daily for 10 days within a 14-day period, followed by a 14-day drug-free period.

**Oral:**

* **Initial Cycle:** 105 mg (5 mL) in the morning after overnight fasting for 14 days, followed by a 14-day drug-free period.  It's crucial to follow specific guidelines regarding food consumption before and after taking the oral dose (see General Considerations).
* **Subsequent Cycles:** 105 mg for 10 days within a 14-day period, followed by a 14-day drug-free period.

**Switching from IV to Oral:**  It is possible to switch from the intravenous 60 mg dose to the 105 mg oral dose, maintaining the same frequency.  However, strict adherence to the oral suspension dosing recommendations regarding food intake is essential.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of edaravone in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Manufacturer labeling does not provide adjustments for severe hepatic impairment.  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment, as renal function is not expected to significantly affect edaravone exposure.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Abnormal gait
* Bruising

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dermatitis, eczema, and tinea (skin conditions)
* Glycosuria (sugar in the urine)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath), hypoxia (low blood oxygen), and respiratory failure


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) and other hypersensitivity reactions.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
The exact mechanism by which edaravone slows the decline in physical function in ALS patients isn't fully understood. However, it's known to be a free-radical and peroxynitrite scavenger.  This means it neutralizes harmful molecules called free radicals that can damage cell membranes and contribute to the progression of ALS. By reducing this oxidative damage, edaravone may help slow the disease's advancement.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Edaravone is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to edaravone or any of its components. There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (such as redness, wheals, and erythema multiforme) and anaphylaxis.
* **Sulfite Allergy:** Exercise caution when using edaravone in patients with asthma or a sulfite allergy, as the intravenous formulation contains sulfites.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with certain drugs, such as diazepam, phenytoin, piperacillin, cefotetan, and cefazolin, may need to be avoided or closely monitored.  Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Edaravone's safety during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established.  The decision to breastfeed during treatment should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the risks of infant exposure against the benefits of breastfeeding and the treatment itself.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment with edaravone last?**  A:  Treatment involves cycles of edaravone administration followed by drug-free periods.  The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your individual response and the progression of your ALS.

* **Q: How is edaravone stored?** A:  Storage instructions vary depending on the formulation (IV or oral). Always refer to the specific instructions provided with your medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for instructions on how to proceed.  Do not try to double up on doses.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking edaravone?** A:  Yes, especially with the oral formulation.  It's crucial to adhere to the specific fasting guidelines before and after taking the medication to maximize absorption and minimize potential side effects (See General Considerations).
