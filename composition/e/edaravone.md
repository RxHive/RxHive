# Edaravone

**Generic Name:** Edaravone

**Usage:**

Edaravone is used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  It's specifically approved for use in adults with ALS to slow the progression of the disease.  It's administered intravenously (IV) in a hospital or clinic setting.  It is *not* a cure for ALS.

**Side Effects:**

Edaravone can cause a variety of side effects, some common and some serious.  The most commonly reported side effects include:

* **Bruising:** This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or allergic reaction.
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, or swelling at the IV injection site.
* **Shortness of breath:** Difficulty breathing.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:** These can range from mild to severe and may require immediate medical attention.
* **Bleeding problems:** Increased risk of bruising or bleeding.
* **Liver problems:** Elevated liver enzymes.
* **Kidney problems:** Changes in kidney function.

It's crucial to report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

The exact mechanism by which edaravone works in ALS is not fully understood. However, it's believed to act as a free radical scavenger, meaning it helps protect nerve cells from damage caused by highly reactive molecules called free radicals.  These free radicals are thought to contribute to the progression of ALS.  By neutralizing these free radicals, edaravone may help slow down the degeneration of motor neurons, which are the nerve cells responsible for muscle movement.
