# Edetate Calcium Disodium
### Generic Name
Edetate Calcium Disodium

### Usage
Edetate calcium disodium is primarily used to treat lead poisoning, both acute and chronic.  It's a chelating agent, meaning it binds to lead in the body, allowing for its removal through urine. This is crucial because lead is a toxic heavy metal that can cause significant harm to various organs and systems, especially the nervous system and kidneys.  The drug is often used in conjunction with another chelating agent, dimercaprol, particularly in severe cases like lead encephalopathy (brain swelling due to lead poisoning).  While its primary use is in lead poisoning, it might be explored in other heavy metal intoxications, but this is less common and requires expert medical supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the severity of lead poisoning, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  It's administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).  **Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions closely, as self-medication can be dangerous.**

**Adults:**

* **Asymptomatic lead poisoning (blood lead levels <70 mcg/dL):** 1000 mg/m²/day for 5 days intravenously or intramuscularly. Maximum daily dose is generally 2000 mg.
* **Symptomatic lead poisoning or blood lead levels ≥70 mcg/dL (often with dimercaprol):** 1000 mg/m²/day or 25-50 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Maximum daily dose is generally 3000 mg.  Administration is typically started with the second dose of dimercaprol.
* **Lead encephalopathy (with dimercaprol):** 1500 mg/m²/day or 50-75 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Maximum daily dose is generally 3000 mg.  Started with the second dose of dimercaprol.
* **Lead nephropathy (alternative regimen):** Dosage is adjusted based on serum creatinine levels and administered over several days or weeks.  This requires careful monitoring by a physician.


**Children:**

Dosages for children are similar in principle but adjusted for their smaller body size, usually calculated based on body surface area (m²) or weight (kg).  Maximum daily dose is generally lower than for adults, often capped at 1000 mg.  Specific dosage for children should always be determined by a physician.


**Administration:**

* **Intravenous (IV):** The daily dose is usually diluted and infused over 8-12 hours or continuously over 24 hours.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** The daily dose may be divided into 2-3 injections given 8-12 hours apart.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Headache
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Fever
*  Muscle aches (myalgia)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)


Less common but more serious side effects can involve:

* Renal (kidney) problems, including nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
* Bone marrow depression
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Edetate calcium disodium works by chelation.  It binds to lead ions in the bloodstream, forming a stable complex that is water-soluble and easily excreted through the kidneys in the urine.  This effectively removes lead from the body, reducing its toxic effects.


### Precautions

* **Renal impairment:**  Edetate calcium disodium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, so caution is needed in patients with kidney problems.  Dosage adjustments are often necessary.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** While classified as Category B in pregnancy (meaning animal studies showed no harm, but human studies are lacking), caution is still warranted due to lead's potential harm to the developing fetus.  Breastfeeding may need to be temporarily stopped if blood lead levels are elevated.
* **Drug interactions:**  Edetate calcium disodium can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Some individuals may be allergic to edetate calcium disodium.
* **Lead encephalopathy:**  In cases of lead encephalopathy (brain swelling due to lead poisoning), the intravenous route should be approached cautiously to avoid rapid infusion, and the intramuscular route is often preferred.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment with edetate calcium disodium last?** A: Treatment duration depends on the severity of lead poisoning and typically lasts for 5 days for many treatment courses, but it can be longer in cases of chronic or severe lead poisoning.
* **Q:  Is edetate calcium disodium safe for children?** A:  It can be used in children, but the dosage is adjusted based on their weight and size, and it requires careful monitoring by a physician due to the risk of serious side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately for guidance. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store edetate calcium disodium?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist. Typically, it's kept at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  Can I take other medications while using edetate calcium disodium?** A: Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions may occur.
