# Estramustine
### Generic Name
Estramustine

### Usage
Estramustine is a medication used in the palliative treatment of progressive or metastatic prostate cancer.  This means it's used to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for men with this advanced form of cancer, but it doesn't cure the disease.  It's important to note that current guidelines from organizations like the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) do not recommend estramustine for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer due to a lack of demonstrated survival benefit and increased risk of side effects.  Its use should be carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare professional in the context of the individual patient's situation.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical oral dose is 14 mg/kg of body weight, divided and administered every 6-8 hours. Treatment duration usually ranges from 30 to 90 days initially to assess its effectiveness.  If the patient experiences a positive response, treatment may continue as long as the benefits outweigh the side effects.  

**Pediatric Dosage:** Estramustine is not recommended for use in children, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Caution is advised when using estramustine in patients with liver or kidney problems.  It may be poorly metabolized in individuals with hepatic impairment, and use is contraindicated in those with severe liver disease.  Those with kidney problems also require careful monitoring.

### How it Works

Estramustine combines estradiol (a female hormone) with nitrogen mustard (a chemotherapy agent).  The estradiol component works as an antiandrogen, reducing the levels of testosterone in the body, which can help slow the growth of prostate cancer cells that depend on testosterone. The nitrogen mustard component disrupts the cell's microtubules, which are essential for cell division and growth, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.  Therefore, it works through two distinct mechanisms to target prostate cancer.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Estramustine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to estramustine, estradiol, nitrogen mustard, or any component of the formulation; active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders (except when the tumor itself is causing the disorder and the benefits outweigh risks); and severe hepatic or cardiac disease.

**Warnings:** Estramustine use is associated with increased risks of high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, endocrine effects (gynecomastia and/or impotence), fluid retention, gastrointestinal toxicity, decreased glucose tolerance, hepatic effects, and hypersensitivity reactions.

**Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using estramustine in patients with a history of thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, or thromboembolic disease; cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease; conditions where fluid accumulation may be poorly tolerated; diabetes mellitus; hepatic impairment; metabolic bone diseases; or renal impairment.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take estramustine with other medications?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting estramustine therapy.  Some medications can interact with it, potentially affecting its efficacy or causing adverse reactions.

* **Q: How should I store estramustine?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Generally, medications should be kept in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: Is estramustine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Estramustine is not indicated for use in women. It's crucial to use effective contraception if you're sexually active.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
