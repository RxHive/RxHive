# Ebola Zaire Vaccine (Live)
### Generic Name
Ebola Zaire Vaccine (Live)

### Usage
The Ebola Zaire vaccine (live) is used to prevent Ebola virus disease caused by the *Zaire ebolavirus* in individuals aged 18 years and older.  It's crucial to understand that this vaccine does *not* protect against other ebolaviruses or Marburg viruses.  Its primary use is pre-exposure prophylaxis, meaning it's given to individuals at high risk of exposure before they come into contact with the virus.  This includes healthcare workers in Ebola treatment centers, laboratory personnel working with the virus in high-security labs (biosafety level 4), and those responding to Ebola outbreaks.

### Dosage
The recommended dose for adults and individuals 18 years and older is a single 1 mL intramuscular (IM) injection.  The injection is typically administered in the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm.  The vaccine is not approved for use in individuals younger than 18 years of age; safety and efficacy haven't been established in this age group.  No dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with hepatic or renal impairment, according to current labeling.

### Side Effects
The Ebola Zaire vaccine can cause several side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Pain at the injection site
* Swelling at the injection site
* Fever
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of recipients):**

* Chills
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Nausea
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Maculopapular rash
* Vesicular eruption (blister-like rash)
* Arthritis


**Serious but Rare Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of recipients):**

* Anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)


If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
The Ebola Zaire vaccine (live) works by inducing an immune response in the body.  After vaccination, the body produces antibodies and immune cells that specifically target the *Zaire ebolavirus*.  If exposed to the virus later, this pre-existing immunity helps prevent or lessen the severity of the disease. The exact mechanisms of how this protection is achieved (through innate, humoral, or cell-mediated immunity) are not fully understood.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions (like anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including rice protein.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of maculopapular and vesicular rashes, anaphylaxis, shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (injection site reactions), and syncope (fainting).

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Limited data exist on pregnancy outcomes after vaccination. Live attenuated vaccines are generally contraindicated during pregnancy.  A decision to vaccinate a pregnant individual should carefully weigh the risk of Ebola virus exposure against the potential risks of the vaccine.  Following vaccination, effective barrier contraception is recommended for two months to prevent potential transmission of the attenuated virus through sexual contact.  The decision to vaccinate a breastfeeding individual should also consider the risks and benefits to both mother and child.

**Immunocompromised Individuals:** The vaccine has not been extensively studied in immunocompromised individuals.  The risk-benefit ratio should be carefully assessed before vaccination in these individuals.

**Other Precautions:**  The vaccine should be administered intramuscularly, preferably in the deltoid muscle.  Proper injection technique and post-injection monitoring are critical.  Patients should be observed for 15 minutes after vaccination to monitor for anaphylaxis or syncope.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does the protection from this vaccine last?**
A: The duration of protection from the Ebola Zaire vaccine is currently unknown.

**Q: Does this vaccine protect against all Ebola viruses?**
A: No, this vaccine only protects against the *Zaire ebolavirus*.  It doesn't offer protection against other ebolaviruses or Marburg viruses.

**Q: What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine?**
A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Symptoms of anaphylaxis can be life-threatening.

**Q: Can I donate blood after receiving the vaccine?**
A: No, you should not donate blood for at least six weeks after vaccination.

**Q: Can I receive other vaccines at the same time as the Ebola Zaire vaccine?**
A:  Generally, simultaneous administration of age-appropriate vaccines is recommended unless contraindications exist. Consult with a healthcare professional for guidance.

**Q: How should I store the Ebola Zaire vaccine?**
A:  Follow the manufacturerâ€™s storage instructions carefully.  This information will be provided with the vaccine.
