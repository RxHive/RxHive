# Ethionamide
### Generic Name
Ethionamide

### Usage
Ethionamide is an antitubercular drug used in the treatment of active tuberculosis (TB).  It's specifically employed as a second-line agent, meaning it's used when first-line drugs like isoniazid or rifampin are ineffective (due to drug resistance) or poorly tolerated by the patient.  Ethionamide is *always* used in combination with other anti-TB medications; it's never given as a monotherapy. Its primary use is in treating TB cases resistant to standard first-line treatment.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical adult dose ranges from 750 mg to 1000 mg daily, divided into 3-4 doses.  Initiation may start at a lower dose (250mg once or twice daily) and be gradually increased to the maximum tolerated dose. Some sources recommend a dosage of 15-20 mg/kg/day.  Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is often recommended to help prevent or mitigate some side effects.

**Children:** The recommended pediatric dosage is 15-20 mg/kg/day, divided into one or two doses (or three times daily in HIV-positive patients). The maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.  A gradual increase in dosage, starting with a lower once-daily dose, is often advised to improve tolerability.  

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, however it should be used cautiously in these patients.  Ethionamide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No specific dose adjustments are mentioned for renal impairment, but some guidelines suggest lower doses (250-500 mg/day) for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute or those on hemodialysis.

**Administration:** Ethionamide is administered orally. It can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food might help reduce gastrointestinal upset.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of ethionamide include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anorexia
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Metallic taste
* Altered sense of smell
* Skin rash

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) â€“ characterized by increased liver enzyme levels, jaundice, and hepatitis.  This is a potentially serious concern and necessitates close monitoring of liver function tests.
* Peripheral neuritis (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Psychiatric disturbances (depression, anxiety, psychosis)
* Hypothyroidism
* Hypoglycemia
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)
* Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Ethionamide's exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to interfere with the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* cell wall. By inhibiting this process, ethionamide disrupts the bacteria's growth and reproduction, leading to a reduction in the infection. Its effect can be bacteriostatic (inhibits growth) or bactericidal (kills bacteria), depending on the concentration at the infection site and bacterial susceptibility.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ethionamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and those with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Interactions:** Ethionamide can interact with numerous medications, altering their effectiveness or causing increased side effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Hepatotoxicity:**  Ethionamide carries a risk of hepatotoxicity. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is essential during treatment.
* **Neurotoxicity:** Ethionamide can cause neurological side effects, including peripheral neuritis. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is frequently co-administered to help mitigate this risk.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Ethionamide is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects on pregnancy are unknown. It's generally not recommended during pregnancy.  The excretion of ethionamide in breast milk is also unclear, so caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients with diabetes, thyroid problems, or porphyria should use ethionamide with caution.  Alcohol consumption should be avoided.  Regular ophthalmic examinations are recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Ethionamide if I feel better?** A: No, it is crucial to complete the entire prescribed course of treatment, even if you feel better, to prevent the development of drug-resistant TB.
* **Q: How should I store Ethionamide?** A: Store Ethionamide as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Is Ethionamide addictive?** A: Ethionamide is not considered an addictive drug.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Ethionamide?** A: No, alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking ethionamide as it can increase the risk of adverse effects.
