# Ethionamide

**Generic Name:** Ethionamide

**Usage:**

Ethionamide is an antituberculosis drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), specifically in cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) where other first-line drugs have proven ineffective.  It's typically used in combination with other anti-TB medications as part of a comprehensive treatment regimen.  It's *not* a first-line treatment for TB.


**Side Effects:**

Ethionamide can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  The most common include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, anorexia (loss of appetite), abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation.
* **Hepatic:**  Elevated liver enzymes (hepatotoxicity), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) â€“ this is a serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Neurological:**  Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in the extremities), dizziness, headache, and mental confusion.
* **Metabolic:**  Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
* **Dermatological:**  Skin rashes, itching.
* **Other:**  Fever, malaise (general feeling of discomfort), metallic taste.

**How it Works:**

Ethionamide is a thioamide derivative that inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the cell wall of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  By disrupting the formation of the bacterial cell wall, ethionamide prevents the growth and replication of the TB bacteria.  Its exact mechanism of action is complex and not fully understood.
