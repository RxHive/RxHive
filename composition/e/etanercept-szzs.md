# Etanercept-szzs
### Generic Name
Etanercept-szzs (Biosimilar to Etanercept)

### Usage

Etanercept-szzs is a biosimilar to Etanercept, a medication that blocks tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein involved in inflammation.  It's primarily used to treat several inflammatory conditions, including:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  Etanercept-szzs helps reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness associated with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.  It's often used in combination with other medications like methotrexate.

* **Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA):** This medication is approved for children aged 2 years and older with moderate to severe polyarticular JIA to reduce joint inflammation and improve function.

* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** Etanercept-szzs helps manage the pain and inflammation characteristic of this chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine.

* **Psoriatic arthritis:** This medication targets the joint inflammation and skin symptoms (psoriasis) associated with psoriatic arthritis.

* **Plaque psoriasis:** Etanercept-szzs is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults and children (aged ≥4 years and weighing ≥63 kg) who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  It helps reduce the scaling, redness, and itching associated with this skin condition.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  Etanercept-szzs is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection.  **Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.**

**Adults:**

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis & Psoriatic Arthritis:** Typically 50 mg once a week.
* **Ankylosing Spondylitis:**  Typically 50 mg once a week, or 25 mg twice a week (given on the same day or 3-4 days apart).
* **Plaque Psoriasis:** Initially, 50 mg twice a week for three months, then 50 mg once a week for maintenance.


**Children (≥2 years and weighing ≥63 kg):**

* **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis:**  Typically 50 mg once a week.  Dosage for children under 2 years of age has not been established.
* **Plaque Psoriasis (≥4 years and weighing ≥63 kg):** 50 mg once a week.


**Important Note:** There is no weight-based dosing for pediatric patients weighing less than 63 kg.  Always consult a healthcare provider for appropriate dosage and administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include injection site reactions (redness, swelling, pain). Less frequent but potentially serious side effects can occur.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

* **Infections:** Increased risk of infections (bacterial, viral, fungal).  This is a major concern, especially with concomitant immunosuppressants.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Heart failure:** Worsening of existing heart failure or development of new heart failure.
* **Blood disorders:**  Rare but serious blood disorders such as aplastic anemia or pancytopenia.
* **Nervous system effects:**  Rare cases of demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis).
* **Malignancies:** Increased risk of certain cancers, including lymphoma.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare cases of liver inflammation or hepatitis reactivation.


### How it Works

Etanercept-szzs works by binding to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-β).  TNF is a protein that plays a significant role in inflammation. By binding to TNF, etanercept-szzs prevents TNF from interacting with its receptors on cells, thus reducing inflammation and improving symptoms associated with the target conditions.


### Precautions

* **Infections:** Patients with current infections, a weakened immune system, or a history of recurrent infections should be carefully monitored.  Etanercept-szzs may increase the risk of serious infections.
* **Tuberculosis (TB):**  Testing for latent TB is crucial before starting treatment.
* **Malignancies:** There's an increased risk of certain cancers; this is especially relevant in children and adolescents.
* **Heart failure:**  Etanercept-szzs should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure.
* **Hepatitis B:**  Reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection may occur; patients with a history of hepatitis B should be monitored closely.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions may occur.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Etanercept-szzs during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established; consult your healthcare provider.
* **Children:**  The dosage and safety in children under 2 years of age haven't been established.
