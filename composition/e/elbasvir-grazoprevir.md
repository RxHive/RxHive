# Elbasvir + Grazoprevir
### Generic Name
Elbasvir + Grazoprevir

### Usage

Elbasvir and Grazoprevir is a combination medication used to treat chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.  Specifically, it's effective against genotypes 1 and 4.  In some cases, particularly with treatment-experienced patients or those with certain characteristics (like specific HCV subtypes or compensated cirrhosis), it's used in combination with ribavirin.  While the primary use is for genotypes 1 and 4,  it may be used off-label in other genotypes (like genotype 3) in specific circumstances, often with another medication like sofosbuvir.  Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment regimen based on individual factors.

### Dosage

Elbasvir/Grazoprevir is typically administered orally as a single tablet once daily.  The dosage is consistent across many situations: 50 mg of Elbasvir and 100 mg of Grazoprevir per tablet. However, the *duration* of treatment varies depending on several factors:

* **Genotype:** Treatment for genotype 1 and 4 typically lasts 12 weeks in treatment-na√Øve patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.  
* **Treatment experience:** For treatment-experienced patients, the duration may increase to 12 or 16 weeks, and ribavirin may be added.  The need for ribavirin and the exact duration will depend on the specifics of prior treatments and the patient's clinical presentation.  This includes patients who have received prior treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, or those who have received treatment with a NS3 protease inhibitor.  The presence of NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in genotype 1a can also affect treatment duration.
* **Specific circumstances:** Patients with genotype 3 may receive Elbasvir/Grazoprevir in combination with sofosbuvir, and this usually is a 12-week course.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of renal or hepatic impairment.  Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) usually doesn't require dosage adjustment, but moderate or severe impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C) or prior hepatic decompensation contraindicates the use of this medication.  Renal impairment generally doesn't require dosage changes unless ribavirin is also used. In this situation, ribavirin dosage is adjusted based on the renal function.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Elbasvir/Grazoprevir in children haven't been established.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include fatigue.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients may include headache and increased serum ALT levels (a liver enzyme).

Less common, but serious side effects, some seen post-marketing, include acute hepatic failure, angioedema, decreased hemoglobin, increased serum bilirubin, reactivation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and severe hepatic disease.  It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Elbasvir and Grazoprevir work by targeting two different parts of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication cycle.  Elbasvir inhibits NS5A, a protein essential for viral replication and assembly.  Grazoprevir inhibits NS3/4A protease, which is vital for the virus's ability to produce new copies of itself. By inhibiting both NS5A and NS3/4A protease, the combination drug effectively stops the HCV from replicating and eventually clears the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Elbasvir/Grazoprevir is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C), a history of hepatic decompensation, or those concurrently using certain medications (including but not limited to atazanavir, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, darunavir, efavirenz, lopinavir, rifampin, saquinavir, and tipranavir), which may interact negatively.
* **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation:**  There's a risk of HBV reactivation in patients co-infected with HCV and HBV.  Testing for HBV is crucial before starting treatment, and careful monitoring is necessary during and after treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Elbasvir/Grazoprevir can interact with several other medications, potentially affecting their efficacy or increasing the risk of side effects.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Special attention should be given to interactions with medications like statins (lovastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin) and immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cyclosporine).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use with ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnant women and men whose partners are pregnant.  The safety of Elbasvir/Grazoprevir during breastfeeding is unknown.
* **Diabetic Patients:**  Rapid viral load reduction can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.  Close glucose monitoring is important.
* **Patients taking warfarin:** INR monitoring is crucial because of the potential for interaction.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Elbasvir/Grazoprevir?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly while undergoing treatment, as alcohol can negatively affect the liver.  Always consult your physician for specific advice.

* **Q: How should I store Elbasvir/Grazoprevir?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Elbasvir/Grazoprevir if I feel better?** A: No, complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant viruses.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Elbasvir/Grazoprevir?** A: Long-term effects are generally not a significant concern after successfully completing the course of treatment, however, ongoing monitoring is recommended to ensure the liver recovers and remains healthy.

* **Q: Is Elbasvir/Grazoprevir right for me?** A: Only a healthcare professional can determine if Elbasvir/Grazoprevir is the appropriate treatment for your specific HCV infection.  Several factors including your genotype, treatment history, and overall health will be considered.
