# Empagliflozin + Metformin
### Generic Name
Empagliflozin + Metformin

### Usage

Empagliflozin and Metformin is a combination medication used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.  It's used when diet and exercise alone aren't enough to control blood sugar levels, and when treatment with both Empagliflozin and Metformin is deemed appropriate by a healthcare professional.  This combination improves glycemic control (blood sugar regulation).  Importantly, Empagliflozin also plays a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and pre-existing cardiovascular disease.  This combination is *not* suitable for type 1 diabetes or for treating diabetic ketoacidosis.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's current treatment,  renal function, and response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:**

Dosage varies depending on whether immediate-release or extended-release formulations are used. Both are usually administered with meals to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.  The starting dose is tailored to the patient's existing medication regimen. Gradual dose escalation is common.

* **Immediate-release:**  Taken twice daily. The maximum recommended daily dose is Empagliflozin 25 mg and Metformin 2000 mg.

* **Extended-release:** Taken once daily (usually in the morning). The maximum recommended daily dose is Empagliflozin 25 mg and Metformin 2000 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Generally avoided due to the risk of lactic acidosis.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary or the medication may be contraindicated depending on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.  The drug is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² and in those with end-stage renal disease or on dialysis.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Empagliflozin + Metformin have not been established in children under 18 years of age.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nausea
* Dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid levels)
* Increased LDL cholesterol
* Decreased vitamin B12 levels
* Urinary tract infections
* Genital mycotic infections (yeast infections)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar - more likely if used with insulin or other blood sugar-lowering medications)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Volume depletion
* Impaired renal function
* Ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes)
* Urosepsis (a severe bloodstream infection originating from the urinary tract)
* Pyelonephritis (kidney infection)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe skin reactions
* Liver injury

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the less common ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Empagliflozin works by inhibiting sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidneys.  This reduces the reabsorption of glucose into the bloodstream, leading to increased excretion of glucose in the urine, thereby lowering blood sugar levels.

Metformin works through multiple mechanisms to lower blood sugar. It reduces glucose production in the liver, decreases glucose absorption in the intestines, and improves the body's sensitivity to insulin.  The combined action of both drugs enhances blood sugar control.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Empagliflozin + Metformin is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity to either drug, acute or chronic metabolic acidosis (including diabetic ketoacidosis), moderate to severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, dialysis, history of lactic acidosis, severe hepatic dysfunction, excessive alcohol use, or during procedures involving iodinated contrast materials.

* **Interactions:**  This combination can interact with several other medications, including diuretics, insulin, insulin secretagogues, and cationic drugs.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of this combination during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution in older adults due to increased risk of renal impairment and other age-related conditions.

* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Avoid excessive alcohol consumption as it can increase the risk of lactic acidosis.

* **Surgical Procedures:**  Temporary discontinuation may be necessary before certain surgical procedures.
