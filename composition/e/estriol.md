# Estriol
### Generic Name
Estriol

### Usage
Estriol, also known as oestriol or 16-alpha-hydroxyestradiol, is a type of estrogen.  Its primary use is in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal women experiencing symptoms of estrogen deficiency. These symptoms can include vaginal dryness, discomfort during intercourse, and hot flashes.  It's also used to treat infertility caused by cervical hostility (a condition where the cervical mucus prevents sperm from reaching the egg).  Additionally, estriol plays a role in the pre- and post-operative management of postmenopausal women undergoing vaginal surgery, helping to prepare the vaginal tissue and aid in healing.  Finally, it's sometimes used as a diagnostic aid before cervical cytology (smear) tests to improve the accuracy of the results.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated and the route of administration (oral, vaginal cream, or vaginal suppository/pessary).  

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Menopausal HRT (oral):**  Typically starts at 0.5-3 mg daily for a month, then reduced to 0.5-1 mg daily or lower, often in combination with other natural estrogens.  A progestogen is usually added if the patient has a uterus to protect against endometrial hyperplasia.
* **Infertility (oral):**  0.25-1 mg daily from days 6-15 of the menstrual cycle, with the dose potentially increased monthly until a beneficial effect is achieved.
* **Vaginal Surgery (oral):** 4-8 mg daily for two weeks before surgery, then 1-2 mg daily for two weeks after.
* **Vaginal Surgery (vaginal):**  Cream (0.01% or 0.1%): 1 applicatorful (0.5 mg) daily, starting two weeks before surgery and continuing for at least two weeks post-surgery (frequency reduced after initial period). Suppositories/pessaries (0.5 mg): 1 daily, starting two weeks before surgery, with a similar post-surgical regimen.
* **Diagnostic Aid (oral/vaginal):** 2-4 mg orally daily or 1 applicatorful of cream/suppository daily for seven days before the smear test.
* **Menopausal Atrophic Vaginitis (vaginal):** Cream or pessary (500 mcg): 500 mcg daily, reducing to twice weekly as needed.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Estriol is not typically used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment, and it's contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.  Always consult a physician for guidance.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include: nausea, vomiting, headache, and application site irritation (for vaginal products).

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:  blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, gallbladder disease, changes in blood sugar levels, endometrial cancer (with unopposed estrogen), and certain types of cancers (breast, ovarian).

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Estriol is an estrogen that binds to estrogen receptors in various tissues throughout the body. In postmenopausal women, this replenishes estrogen levels, alleviating symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency.  In the case of infertility due to cervical hostility, estriol modifies cervical mucus properties, allowing sperm easier passage to the egg. In vaginal tissue, it promotes healing and improves the vaginal lining's health.


### Precautions
Estriol is contraindicated in individuals with a history of breast cancer, estrogen-dependent tumors, blood clots, stroke, heart attack, liver disease, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, untreated endometrial hyperplasia, pregnancy, or breastfeeding.  It should be used cautiously in patients with conditions like diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, migraine, or those taking medications that could interact with estriol.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential during estriol therapy.
