# Evogliptin + Metformin
### Generic Name
Evogliptin + Metformin

### Usage
Evogliptin + Metformin is a combination medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.  It combines two different types of diabetes medications:  evogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin, a biguanide.  This combination helps to improve blood sugar control by working through different mechanisms within the body.  The primary use is to lower blood glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes who haven't achieved adequate blood sugar control with metformin alone or those who are already taking metformin and need additional help managing their diabetes.  While not a primary indication, this combination may sometimes be considered as part of a broader diabetes management strategy involving other medications or lifestyle adjustments if needed.

### Dosage
Dosage of Evogliptin + Metformin depends on the individual patient's needs and response to treatment. A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose.  There is no universally applicable dosage that works for everyone.  

* **Oral Administration:**  The usual starting dose of the combination medication is determined by the physician based on the patient's current metformin dosage and the need for additional glycemic control.  The dose is then adjusted based on blood glucose monitoring and the patient's response.  It is crucial to follow your doctor's precise instructions on the dosage and frequency of administration.

* **IV Administration:** Evogliptin + Metformin is not administered intravenously.  Evogliptin and metformin are given orally.


Dosage adjustments should be made cautiously, especially in older adults or those with kidney problems.  The maximum daily dose should not be exceeded without consulting with a healthcare professional.  The combination should always be prescribed by a doctor, and patients should adhere to the specific dosage instructions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects associated with Evogliptin + Metformin can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Metallic taste
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), especially if combined with other diabetes medications or if a patient does not eat properly.
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Lactic acidosis (rare, but serious; characterized by fatigue, muscle pain, and rapid breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if suspected.

Less common, but serious side effects, require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Liver problems


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Evogliptin and Metformin work through distinct mechanisms to lower blood glucose levels.

* **Evogliptin:**  Evogliptin inhibits the enzyme DPP-4, which normally breaks down incretins. Incretins are hormones that stimulate insulin release from the pancreas after a meal and help to regulate blood sugar levels. By inhibiting DPP-4, evogliptin increases incretin levels, leading to improved insulin secretion and reduced glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar).

* **Metformin:** Metformin primarily works by reducing the liver's production of glucose and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin.  It also slightly decreases glucose absorption in the intestines.

The combination of these two medications provides a synergistic effect, improving blood sugar control more effectively than either drug alone.

### Precautions
* **Kidney Disease:**  Metformin can accumulate in the kidneys and lead to lactic acidosis, a serious condition.  Kidney function should be evaluated before starting metformin and regularly monitored during treatment.  Metformin may need to be discontinued or the dose adjusted if kidney function deteriorates.

* **Liver Disease:**  Liver function should be assessed before and during treatment as both components can affect the liver.

* **Heart Failure:**  Metformin should be used with caution in patients with heart failure.

* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of lactic acidosis, especially when combined with metformin.

* **Surgery:**  Metformin should usually be stopped before and after major surgery or contrast medium administration.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Evogliptin + Metformin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.


* **Drug Interactions:**  Evogliptin + Metformin can interact with several other medications, including some diuretics, beta-blockers, and certain antibiotics. Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Evogliptin + Metformin if I feel better?** A: No,  It is crucial to continue taking the medication as prescribed by your healthcare professional, even if you feel well. Stopping abruptly can lead to worsening blood sugar control.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Evogliptin + Metformin?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q:  Are there any dietary recommendations?** A: Maintaining a balanced diet and regular exercise are essential parts of diabetes management.  Talk to your doctor or a registered dietician for personalized recommendations.


* **Q: What are the long-term risks of using Evogliptin + Metformin?** A: Long-term risks may include hypoglycemia, weight gain, and vitamin B12 deficiency (with Metformin). Regular monitoring and communication with your doctor are crucial for mitigating these risks.
