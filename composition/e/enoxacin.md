# Enoxacin
### Generic Name
Enoxacin

### Usage

Enoxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections of the urinary tract, encompassing both uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).  It's also effective against uncomplicated gonorrhea of the urethra or cervix.  While effective against a range of bacteria, its use is generally reserved for these specific infections due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and concerns regarding potential side effects.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Uncomplicated UTI:** 200 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days.
* **Complicated UTI:** 400 mg BID for 14 days.
* **Uncomplicated Urethral or Cervical Gonorrhea:** 400 mg as a single dose.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of enoxacin in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 30 mL/min, no dosage adjustment is needed. If CrCl is 30 mL/min or less, administer half the recommended dose BID.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment; however, caution is advised when using enoxacin in patients with liver problems.  Close monitoring is necessary.


The medication is usually administered orally, taken with a full glass of water. It should be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after meals.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
* Central nervous system effects (dizziness, headache)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, skin rash)
* Reversible joint pain (arthralgia)
* Liver enzyme abnormalities
* Blood disorders
* Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
* Superinfections (new infections due to the disruption of normal bacterial flora)
* Pain and irritation at the injection site (if administered intravenously, though less common with oral administration)
* Tendon damage (a serious, though less frequent, side effect)
* Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (inflammation of veins, more likely with intravenous administration)

Less common but serious side effects necessitate immediate medical attention. These include tendonitis and tendon rupture.  Any unusual or concerning side effect should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Enoxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. It works by inhibiting two crucial enzymes in bacteria: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. By blocking their function, enoxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Enoxacin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to enoxacin or any of its components, breastfeeding women, and children under 18 years of age.
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, myasthenia gravis, epilepsy, or a history of central nervous system disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:** Enoxacin can interact with several medications, including theophylline, caffeine, antacids, metal cations, and antineoplastics, potentially altering their metabolism and effectiveness.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting enoxacin treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Enoxacin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning that the risks to the fetus are not fully known.  It is not recommended for use during breastfeeding.
* **Sunlight Sensitivity:** Patients should avoid excessive sun exposure while taking enoxacin, as it can increase sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take enoxacin with food?** A: No, it's best to take enoxacin on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.

* **Q: How should I store enoxacin?** A: Store enoxacin in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking enoxacin?** A: While there is no specific contraindication against alcohol, it is advisable to avoid alcohol as it can increase the risk of some side effects, such as nausea and dizziness.

* **Q: How long does it take for enoxacin to work?** A:  The time it takes to notice improvement varies depending on the infection, but you should start to feel better within a few days.  Complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms improve, to ensure the infection is fully eradicated.
