**Generic Name:** Erenumab

**It is crucial to note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a healthcare professional or refer to the full prescribing information for a complete list of potential side effects.  If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

Erenumab is a monoclonal antibody.  It works by targeting and blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor.  CGRP is a protein that plays a significant role in the process of migraine pain and inflammation. By blocking the CGRP receptor, erenumab helps to prevent the release of CGRP and thus reduces the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.
