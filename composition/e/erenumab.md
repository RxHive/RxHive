# Erenumab
### Generic Name
Erenumab

### Usage
Erenumab is a monoclonal antibody primarily used for the preventative treatment of migraine in adults.  Its mechanism focuses on targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand, a molecule believed to play a significant role in migraine initiation and propagation. While its primary use is for migraine prevention, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other CGRP-related conditions.  It's specifically designed to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks, not to treat an acute migraine episode.  Therefore, it's not a "rescue medication" to be taken when a migraine begins.


### Dosage
Erenumab is administered via subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  Dosage is typically determined by a healthcare provider and depends on the individual's response to treatment. 

* **Adults (Migraine Prevention):** The usual starting dose is 70 mg administered once monthly.  A dose of 140 mg monthly may be considered if the initial dose proves inadequate.  The dose should not be increased beyond 140 mg.

* **Pediatric Use:**  Erenumab is not currently approved for use in children.

**Important Administration Notes:**  The medication should be injected exactly as prescribed by your doctor or nurse. Detailed instructions should be included with your medication packaging and reviewed with your healthcare provider before beginning treatment.  Proper injection technique minimizes discomfort and risk of adverse reactions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Erenumab, generally mild, can include:

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, itching)
* Constipation
* Fatigue
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious, side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, or tongue)
* Hypersensitivity reactions

It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to your healthcare provider promptly.


### How it Works
Erenumab works by binding to and blocking the CGRP ligand.  CGRP is a protein involved in transmitting pain signals in the brain. By preventing CGRP from binding to its receptors, Erenumab disrupts the cascade of events that lead to migraine headaches.  This targeted approach contributes to a reduction in the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.  It's important to note that Erenumab doesn't eliminate CGRP entirely, but reduces its activity sufficiently to impact migraine frequency.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Individuals with known hypersensitivity to Erenumab or its components should not use this medication.
* **Interactions:**  While significant drug interactions are not widely reported, it is always advisable to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Erenumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Discuss these considerations with your doctor before using Erenumab if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
* **Hepatic (Liver) Impairment:** Individuals with severe hepatic impairment should use caution; dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consult your physician.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** While Erenumab doesn't typically cause drowsiness, it's wise to observe your reaction to the medication and avoid operating machinery if you experience any dizziness or other effects that may impair your ability.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take Erenumab to work?**  A:  The onset of effect varies among individuals.  Some may experience a reduction in migraine frequency within a few weeks, while others may need several months to observe a significant benefit.


* **Q: Can I take Erenumab with other migraine medications?** A: Discuss this with your doctor.  While Erenumab can be used alongside certain migraine medications, some combinations may not be advisable.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor as soon as possible to discuss your next injection.  Do not attempt to double the next dose.


* **Q: How should I store Erenumab?** A:  Store Erenumab in the refrigerator.  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.


* **Q: Is Erenumab right for me?** A:  Only a doctor can determine if Erenumab is an appropriate treatment for your specific migraine condition.
