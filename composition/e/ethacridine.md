# Ethacridine

**Generic Name:** Ethacridine lactate (also known as Rivanol)

**Usage:** Ethacridine lactate is a topical antiseptic.  Its use is largely limited and is not commonly used in modern medicine in many parts of the world.  Historically and in some regions it may still be used for:

* **Treatment of superficial wounds:**  This includes minor cuts, abrasions, and burns.
* **Disinfection of skin:** Prior to certain procedures.
* **Treatment of some skin infections:**  Although its efficacy compared to modern antiseptics is debated.
* **Vaginal douches (Historically, and should be used with extreme caution, if at all, due to potential harm):**  This use is largely outdated due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.


**Side Effects:** Ethacridine lactate is generally considered to be relatively safe when used topically at recommended concentrations, but potential side effects include:

* **Skin irritation:**  Burning, stinging, or redness at the application site.
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, individuals may experience an allergic reaction, ranging from mild rash to severe hypersensitivity.
* **Staining:** Ethacridine lactate stains skin and fabrics yellow-brown. This is usually temporary, but tenacious.


**How it Works:** Ethacridine lactate works by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and other microorganisms, leading to their death.  It's a relatively non-specific antiseptic, meaning it affects a broad range of microbes but lacks the targeted action of modern antibiotics.


**FAQs:**

* **Is ethacridine lactate an antibiotic?** No, it's an antiseptic, meaning it kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms on living tissue, but it doesn't target specific bacterial species like antibiotics do.
* **Is ethacridine lactate effective against all bacteria?** No, its effectiveness varies depending on the microorganism and the concentration used.  Modern antiseptics and antibiotics are generally preferred for their broader efficacy and predictability.
* **How long does it take to work?**  Its antiseptic effect is relatively rapid at the site of application.
* **Can ethacridine lactate be ingested?** No, it's strictly for external use only. Ingestion can be toxic.
* **Is ethacridine lactate available over-the-counter?** Availability varies considerably by region. In many countries, it's no longer readily available due to the preference for more modern antiseptics.
* **What should I do if I experience a reaction?** Stop using the product immediately and consult a doctor or pharmacist.
