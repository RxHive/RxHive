# Ethacridine
### Generic Name
Ethacridine

### Usage
Ethacridine is primarily used as a topical antiseptic for the treatment of minor skin infections and wounds.  It's applied to the affected area to help prevent infection and promote healing.  A less common, and more significant, use is as an abortifacient, specifically for medical termination of pregnancy during the second trimester. In this context, it's considered safer and better tolerated than some other methods like hypertonic saline.  It's crucial to understand that using ethacridine for abortion requires strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Second Trimester):**  Ethacridine is administered extra-amniotically (outside the amniotic sac). A 0.1% solution is used, with a dosage of 10 mL per gestational week, up to a maximum of 200 mL. The solution is slowly instilled using a Foley catheter, which is then clamped and left in place for 24 hours unless expelled sooner.  This procedure should only be performed by a qualified healthcare professional in a controlled medical setting.

**Topical Antiseptic Use:** For treating minor wounds and skin infections, a 0.1% cutaneous solution of ethacridine is applied directly to the affected area 2-3 times daily.


### Side Effects
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Delayed wound healing (with prolonged use)
* Other side effects may occur, especially during use as an abortifacient, which necessitates close medical monitoring.

It's important to report any side effects, no matter how minor, to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
As a topical antiseptic, ethacridine works by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms that may cause infection. Its mechanism of action as an abortifacient is less well understood but is believed to induce uterine contractions leading to the termination of the pregnancy.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ethacridine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug and is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy except for its intended use as an abortifacient under strict medical supervision.
* **Interactions:** The activity of ethacridine is enhanced by alkaline solutions.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with a history of uterine or cervical surgery or heart disease.  When used as an abortifacient, close medical monitoring is essential due to potential complications.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ethacridine is contraindicated during pregnancy except for its use in medically induced abortion as directed by a physician.  Information on use during breastfeeding is not readily available and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
