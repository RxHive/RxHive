# Etretinate
### Generic Name
Etretinate

### Usage
Etretinate is a retinoid medication primarily used to treat severe, extensive psoriasis that hasn't responded to other treatments.  This includes generalized psoriasis and palmo-plantar pustular psoriasis.  It's important to note that acitretin is now generally preferred over etretinate due to safety concerns.  Etretinate was withdrawn from the market in many countries, including Canada and the United States, because of its potential to cause birth defects.  However, it may still be available in some regions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (for severe psoriasis):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is typically 0.75-1 mg/kg/day, divided into multiple doses throughout the day. The maximum dose is 1.5 mg/kg/day.  For erythrodermic psoriasis, a lower initial dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day may be used, increasing gradually as tolerated.
* **Maintenance:** After an initial response (usually 8-16 weeks), the dose may be reduced to 0.5-0.75 mg/kg/day.
* **Treatment Duration:**  Treatment should be stopped once the psoriasis lesions have sufficiently improved. Relapses can be treated with a similar regimen.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of etretinate in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling. However, caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment, and it's contraindicated in those with severely impaired liver or kidney function.  Etretinate is not removed by hemodialysis.

### How it Works

Etretinate is a prodrug of acitretin. It works by binding to and activating retinoid X receptors (RXR) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR) in the cell nucleus.  This action inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (like interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma), which are involved in the excessive cell growth and keratinization seen in psoriasis.  By reducing these inflammatory processes and abnormal skin cell production, etretinate helps to alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis, such as skin thickening, plaque formation, and scaling.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Etretinate is categorized as Pregnancy Category X. It is strictly contraindicated in women who are pregnant or may become pregnant during treatment or within three years after stopping treatment due to its severe teratogenic effects (risk of causing birth defects).  Reliable contraception is essential.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It's unknown whether etretinate is excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution if breastfeeding.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment and for two months after stopping treatment because alcohol may increase the risk of birth defects.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Use with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment. It's contraindicated in those with severe impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Etretinate can interact with various medications, including vitamin A, tetracyclines, and other photosensitizing agents. Consult your doctor about any other medications you are taking.
* **Other:**  Monitor lipid profile, liver function tests, and blood glucose levels (in diabetics) regularly during treatment.
