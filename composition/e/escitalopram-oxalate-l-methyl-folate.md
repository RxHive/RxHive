# Escitalopram Oxalate + L-Methyl Folate
### Generic Name
Escitalopram Oxalate + L-Methylfolate


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), particularly in individuals who haven't responded well to escitalopram alone.  Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), working to increase serotonin levels in the brain, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation. L-methylfolate, a form of folate (vitamin B9), is added because low folate levels can sometimes interfere with the effectiveness of SSRIs and contribute to depression.  While not a primary treatment for anxiety disorders, this combination may be considered for individuals with depression and co-occurring anxiety symptoms, particularly if folate deficiency is suspected.  The use of this combination should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare provider based on factors such as the patient's age, weight, health status, and response to treatment.  There isn't a standardized dosage for this combination as it's often prescribed as two separate medications rather than a single pre-combined formulation.

* **Escitalopram:**  The typical starting dose for adults is 10mg daily, which may be gradually increased by the physician to a maximum of 20mg daily, depending on individual response and tolerability.  Children and adolescents usually require lower dosages determined by a specialist.  Oral administration is standard.  There is no IV formulation of escitalopram currently approved.
* **L-Methylfolate:** The dosage of L-methylfolate varies significantly depending on the individual's needs and whether it's being used to address a diagnosed folate deficiency.  It's usually taken orally, and dosage instructions will be provided by the prescribing physician.

**Important:** Never adjust the dosage of either medication without consulting a doctor.  Abrupt discontinuation of escitalopram can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

### How it Works

Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  It works by blocking the reabsorption (reuptake) of serotonin in the brain. This increases the amount of serotonin available in the synaptic cleft, enhancing its effects on mood, sleep, and other bodily functions.  L-methylfolate is a readily usable form of folate.  Folate is essential for various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. By providing sufficient folate, the combination aims to enhance the effectiveness of escitalopram and address potential deficiencies that could negatively impact mood regulation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to escitalopram or any of its components.  It should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or bleeding disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Escitalopram can interact with many medications, including MAOIs, certain pain medications, and other antidepressants.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of escitalopram during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare professional.  The potential benefits must be weighed against potential risks to the developing fetus or infant.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly individuals may require lower doses due to increased sensitivity to the medication.
* **Children and Adolescents:**  The use of this combination in children and adolescents should be under the close supervision of a specialist.


### FAQs
