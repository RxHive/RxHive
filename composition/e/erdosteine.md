# Erdosteine
### Generic Name
Erdosteine

### Usage
Erdosteine is primarily used as a mucolytic agent in the treatment of chronic bronchitis.  Mucolytics work by thinning and loosening thick mucus, making it easier to cough up. This is particularly beneficial in chronic bronchitis, where excessive mucus buildup in the airways can cause significant breathing problems.  While its primary use is in chronic bronchitis, it may also be used to help manage other respiratory conditions where excessive or thick mucus is a problem.  However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment plan before using erdosteine for any condition.

### Dosage
Dosage of erdosteine varies depending on the form of the medication (capsule or suspension) and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.


**Adults (Chronic Bronchitis):**

* **Capsules:** 300 mg twice or three times daily.  For acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, treatment should not exceed 10 days.
* **Suspension:** 350 mg twice daily.


**Children and Adolescents (Chronic Bronchitis):**

* **Suspension:**  Dosage is weight-based:
    * 15 to <20 kg: 175 mg twice daily
    * 20 to 30 kg: 175 mg three times daily
    * >30 kg: Same as adult dosage


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  Mild to moderate impairment:  Do not exceed 300 mg per day. Severe impairment: Erdosteine is contraindicated (should not be used).
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¥ 25 mL/minute: No dosage adjustment is usually needed according to manufacturer labeling.  CrCl < 25 mL/minute: Erdosteine is contraindicated.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious side effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Erdosteine contains sulfhydryl groups. After being metabolized in the liver, these groups break the disulfide bonds within the glycoprotein structure of mucus. This process makes the mucus less viscous (thicker), improving its flow and facilitating its expulsion from the airways.

### Precautions

**Contraindications (Erdosteine should NOT be used if):**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to erdosteine or any component of the formulation.
* Active peptic ulcer.
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 25 mL/minute).
* Severe hepatic impairment (including cirrhosis and cystathionine-synthase deficiency).


**Increased Risk:**

* Severe allergic hypersensitivity reactions are possible when formulations containing sunset yellow FCF dye are used.


**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with diabetes.
* In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
* In patients with allergies to yellow dyes.

Pregnancy and Lactation:  The use of erdosteine during pregnancy should be avoided if possible.  Its excretion into breast milk is unknown, therefore use is not recommended while breastfeeding.
