# Ergotamine
### Generic Name
Ergotamine

### Usage
Ergotamine is primarily used to treat and prevent vascular headaches, most notably migraines and migraine variants, including so-called histaminic cephalalgia.  It's considered an abortive treatment, meaning it's used to stop a headache once it's started, rather than as a preventative medication taken regularly.  While it has been used historically for other conditions, its use in these is largely superseded by newer, safer medications.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Vascular Headache):**  The usual sublingual (under the tongue) dose is 2 mg (one tablet) at the first sign of a migraine.  This can be repeated every 30 minutes as needed, but the total dose should not exceed 6 mg in 24 hours or 10 mg per week.  Do not crush the tablet.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of ergotamine in children and adolescents haven't been established.  It's generally not recommended for this population due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives.  In some cases, a doctor might consider it for adolescents, using a similar sublingual dosage to adults (2 mg every 30 minutes, not to exceed 6 mg in 24 hours or 10 mg per week), but this is rare.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Ergotamine is contraindicated (absolutely forbidden) in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Numbness or tingling (paresthesia)
* Cold extremities
* Dizziness (vertigo)
* Chest pain (precordial pain)

Less common, but serious side effects include:

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Vasospasm (narrowing of blood vessels) leading to ischemia (lack of blood flow) potentially resulting in gangrene (tissue death).
* ECG changes
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Weakness
* Allergic reactions

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Ergotamine's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's thought to work by affecting several types of receptors in the brain and blood vessels. It acts as a partial agonist and/or antagonist on serotonin, dopamine, and alpha-adrenergic receptors. This complex interaction leads to constriction of blood vessels in the brain, which helps alleviate migraine pain.  It also influences central nervous system activity associated with migraine.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ergotamine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to ergotamine or any component of the formulation
* Peripheral vascular disease
* Impaired liver or kidney function
* Coronary artery disease
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Pregnancy (Category X â€“ risk to the fetus outweighs any potential benefit)
* Sepsis (severe bloodstream infection)
* Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., some protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics)

**Warnings:**  Ergotamine can increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events, including vasospasm leading to potentially life-threatening tissue ischemia (lack of blood flow).  Prolonged use can cause ergotism, a condition characterized by severe peripheral vascular constriction and potentially gangrene.  Long-term use should be closely monitored and is generally not recommended.  Elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to these side effects.  It should be avoided in people with a history of heart problems.


**Drug Interactions:**  Ergotamine interacts with many medications.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements.  In particular, concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Grapefruit juice can also increase ergotamine blood levels.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take ergotamine?** A:  Ergotamine is typically used only during migraine attacks and not for prolonged periods.  Exceeding the recommended maximum daily and weekly dosages can increase the risk of severe side effects. Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration of use.

* **Q: Can I take ergotamine with other migraine medications?** A:  You should always discuss with your doctor before combining ergotamine with other migraine medications.  Some combinations can lead to dangerous interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store ergotamine?** A: Store ergotamine as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I use ergotamine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: No. Ergotamine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the risk of harm to the fetus and infant.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking ergotamine?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking ergotamine as alcohol can increase the risk of some side effects.
