# Ergotamine

**Generic Name:** Ergotamine

**Usage:** Ergotamine is used to treat migraine headaches, specifically to abort an ongoing migraine attack. It's not typically used for migraine prevention.  It's often used in combination with caffeine to enhance its effectiveness.  It may also be used in some cases to treat cluster headaches.

**Side Effects:** Ergotamine can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and some severe.  These can include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, tingling in the extremities, cold hands and feet.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased blood pressure, chest pain, shortness of breath, muscle pain or weakness, numbness or tingling, changes in vision (blurred vision, double vision), hallucinations, confusion, seizures.
* **Rare but Life-Threatening:**  Ergotamine overdose can lead to serious cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), gangrene (tissue death), and ergotism (a condition characterized by severe vasoconstriction and peripheral ischemia).


**How it Works:** Ergotamine is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows blood vessels. In the case of migraine headaches, it is thought to work by constricting dilated blood vessels in the brain, thereby reducing pain and other migraine symptoms. The exact mechanism is not fully understood.  The caffeine component in combination products is believed to enhance the absorption of ergotamine and reduce its side effects.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often can I take ergotamine?**  A:  Ergotamine should not be taken too frequently due to the risk of serious side effects, including dependence and ergotism.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Generally, it's recommended to limit usage to no more than two doses in a 24-hour period and no more than 10 doses per month.

* **Q: Can I take ergotamine with other medications?** A:  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as ergotamine can interact with many medications, including some antidepressants, antibiotics, and other migraine medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, do not double the dose. Take the next dose as scheduled unless your migraine has subsided.

* **Q: What are the signs of an overdose?** A: Symptoms of ergotamine overdose can include severe nausea, vomiting, intense abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, severe muscle pain or weakness, and cold extremities. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose.

* **Q: Is ergotamine addictive?** A:  Ergotamine can be habit-forming if used excessively. Prolonged or frequent use can lead to dependence, characterized by increased tolerance and withdrawal symptoms when the medication is stopped.

* **Q:  Is ergotamine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  Ergotamine is generally not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women due to potential risks to the developing fetus or infant.  Discuss this with your doctor.
