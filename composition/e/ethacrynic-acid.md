# Ethacrynic Acid
### Generic Name
Ethacrynic Acid

### Usage
Ethacrynic acid is a powerful diuretic (water pill) primarily used to treat edema (swelling caused by fluid buildup).  This swelling can be associated with several conditions, including:

* **Congestive heart failure:**  Ethacrynic acid helps remove excess fluid from the body, reducing strain on the heart.
* **Cirrhosis of the liver:** Liver damage can lead to fluid retention; Ethacrynic acid helps alleviate this.
* **Renal (kidney) disease, including nephrotic syndrome:** Kidney problems can impair the body's ability to eliminate fluid, leading to edema. Ethacrynic acid aids in fluid removal.
* **Ascites due to malignancy:** Cancer can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites).  Ethacrynic acid provides short-term management.
* **Idiopathic edema and lymphedema:** These conditions involve unexplained swelling and lymphatic system dysfunction, respectively. Ethacrynic acid offers short-term relief.
* **Congenital heart disease and nephrotic syndrome in hospitalized pediatric patients (excluding infants):** Ethacrynic acid is used for short-term management in these cases.


Intravenous (IV) administration is preferred when rapid diuresis (fluid removal) is crucial, such as in acute pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), or when oral medication is impractical or absorption is impaired.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Edema (alternative agent):** Initial IV dose is typically 50 mg or 0.5-1 mg/kg, with a maximum of 100 mg per dose. Repeat doses are not usually recommended, but a second dose might be given after 8-12 hours if necessary. Oral dosage ranges from 25-100 mg/day in one or two divided doses.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage is determined by weight and the specific condition.

* **Congenital heart disease/nephrotic syndrome:**  Oral: 1 mg/kg/day, potentially increased in 2-3 day intervals up to a maximum of 3 mg/kg/day. IV: 1 mg/kg.
* **Edema (diuresis):**  Oral: Initial dose 1 mg/kg once daily, not exceeding 25-50 mg. This can be increased every 2-3 days to a maximum of 3 mg/kg/day in divided doses. The maximum daily dose is 400 mg. IV (intermittent infusion): 0.5-1 mg/kg every 8-24 hours, not exceeding 50 mg/dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Use is not recommended if the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is less than 10 mL/min.  Ethacrynic acid is not removed by dialysis; therefore, supplemental doses are unnecessary.  It is contraindicated in patients with anuria (absence of urine).


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Dehydration
* Low blood pressure
* Electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium, or calcium)
* Hearing loss (temporary or permanent)
* Liver damage
* Kidney damage
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching)

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Ethacrynic acid is a loop diuretic.  It works in the kidneys by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the loop of Henle and distal tubule. This action prevents the body from reabsorbing water, leading to increased excretion of water, sodium, chloride, magnesium, and calcium in the urine, thus reducing fluid buildup.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ethacrynic acid is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or any component, anuria, history of severe watery diarrhea caused by the drug, and infants.
* **Interactions:** Ethacrynic acid can interact with many other medications, including ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, and others.  These interactions can increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effectiveness of either drug. Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease. Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial, particularly during initial therapy.  Older adults and individuals with pre-existing conditions may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Ethacrynic acid is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking.  The safety in breastfeeding is unknown. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration. IV administration provides a faster effect than oral administration.
* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking ethacrynic acid suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to rebound fluid retention.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: Alcohol can worsen dehydration and interact with the medication.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking ethacrynic acid.  Consult your doctor.
