# Eperisone + Diclofenac
### Generic Name
Eperisone + Diclofenac

### Usage

Eperisone + Diclofenac is a combination medication used to relieve pain and muscle spasms, particularly in conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system.  Its primary use is in the management of musculoskeletal pain associated with conditions like:

* **Back pain (lumbago):**  This combination is effective in reducing both the pain and muscle stiffness often experienced with back problems.
* **Neck pain (cervicalgia):**  Similar to back pain, it can help alleviate pain and improve mobility in the neck.
* **Muscle strains and sprains:** The combination addresses both the pain and muscle spasm that commonly accompany these injuries.
* **Other musculoskeletal conditions:** It may be used to manage pain and muscle spasms in other conditions causing musculoskeletal discomfort, as directed by a physician.

It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the symptoms of these conditions, not the underlying cause.  If the underlying cause is not addressed, the pain and muscle spasms may return.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (tablet, injection, etc.), the patient's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  **It is vital to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist precisely.**  There is no standardized universal dosage; therefore, the information below is for illustrative purposes and should not be considered a prescription.  **Never self-medicate.**

**General Guidance (Illustrative Only â€“ Consult your physician for accurate dosage):**

* **Oral:** The dosage will usually be one or two tablets taken several times daily as prescribed.  The exact dosage will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs.
* **Injectable (if applicable):** Injectable forms, if available, will be administered by a healthcare professional.  The dosage and frequency will be determined by the physician.

**Children:**  This combination medication is typically not recommended for use in children unless specifically prescribed by a physician due to the lack of sufficient pediatric data.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these:

### How it Works

Eperisone is a muscle relaxant. It works by affecting the central nervous system to reduce muscle spasms and stiffness.  Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing inflammation and pain in the affected area.  Together, they provide a synergistic effect, addressing both the pain and muscle spasm components of musculoskeletal disorders.
