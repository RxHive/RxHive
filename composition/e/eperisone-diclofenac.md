# Eperisone + Diclofenac

**Generic Name:** Eperisone + Diclofenac

**Usage:**  This combination drug is typically used to treat musculoskeletal pain and spasticity.  The diclofenac component is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. The eperisone component is a muscle relaxant that reduces muscle spasms and stiffness.  It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* Muscle strains and sprains
* Back pain (lumbago)
* Neck pain (cervicalgia)
* Rheumatoid arthritis (in conjunction with other treatments)
* Certain types of spasticity (e.g., associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury)


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **From Diclofenac:**  Gastrointestinal upset (indigestion, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, ulcers, bleeding), headache, dizziness, increased risk of heart attack and stroke (especially with long-term use), fluid retention, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), increased liver enzyme levels.
* **From Eperisone:**  Dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, weakness, fatigue, headache.  Less common but more serious side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and drug interactions.


**How it Works:**

* **Diclofenac:** Works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause inflammation and pain.
* **Eperisone:**  Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to act on the central nervous system to reduce muscle spasms and improve muscle tone.  It may also affect the release of neurotransmitters involved in muscle contraction.  The combined effect of both drugs provides both pain relief and muscle relaxation.
