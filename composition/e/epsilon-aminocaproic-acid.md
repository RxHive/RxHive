# Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid
### Generic Name
Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid

### Usage
Epsilon aminocaproic acid is primarily used to control bleeding caused by excessive breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis).  This is particularly helpful in situations where fibrinolysis contributes significantly to bleeding, such as after cardiac surgery, in certain hematologic (blood) disorders, some types of cancer, abruptio placentae (placental detachment during pregnancy), hepatic cirrhosis (liver disease), and urinary fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots in the urinary tract).  It's crucial to understand that this medication doesn't stop all types of bleeding; it specifically targets bleeding stemming from excessive fibrinolysis.  The use of epsilon aminocaproic acid in other conditions, such as control of bleeding in severe thrombocytopenia, control of oral bleeding in congenital and acquired coagulation disorders, control of refractory bleeding associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), intracranial hemorrhage associated with thrombolytics,  prevention of bleeding in patients undergoing dental procedures while on oral anticoagulant therapy, prevention of perioperative bleeding associated with cardiac surgery, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic hyphema, is considered off-label use.  This means itâ€™s used for these conditions outside of its officially approved indications.  Always consult a doctor before using it for any condition.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (oral, intravenous), and the patient's age and weight.  Specific details are provided below but should be considered for informational purposes only.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage in each case.

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage ranges widely from 4-5 grams initially, followed by 1-1.25 grams per hour for several hours, up to a maximum daily dose of 30 grams for acute bleeding. Different regimens are used depending on the specific clinical situation and whether it's given orally or intravenously (IV). For instance, in the setting of cardiac surgery, different loading and maintenance doses are employed with potential addition to cardiopulmonary bypass circuit priming solution. Off-label uses involve widely variable doses as well.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and based on weight.  They generally range from 50-100 mg/kg every 4-6 hours, with maximum daily doses typically around 24 grams.  Again, these are guidelines, and a physician will tailor the dosage to the individual child's needs and condition.  Specific dosing differs substantially based on the condition being treated.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramps
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Rash
* Fatigue
* Muscle pain

Less common, but more serious side effects, may include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Renal failure (kidney failure)
* Thrombosis (blood clots)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Epsilon aminocaproic acid works by inhibiting the breakdown of blood clots (fibrinolysis). It does this by competitively binding to plasminogen, a protein crucial for clot breakdown.  By binding to plasminogen, epsilon aminocaproic acid prevents its conversion to plasmin, the enzyme responsible for dissolving clots.  This allows blood clots to remain stable, helping to control bleeding, particularly in situations where excessive fibrinolysis is present.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Epsilon aminocaproic acid should not be used in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) without concomitant heparin, or with evidence of active intravascular clotting.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in individuals with kidney problems, as the drug is primarily eliminated by the kidneys and could accumulate to harmful levels. Dose adjustment might be necessary in such patients.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** While no specific dosage adjustment is recommended, liver disease may affect metabolism and thus impact efficacy or tolerability. Consult your healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Epsilon aminocaproic acid can interact with other medications, such as those affecting clotting, so it is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, herbs, or supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Epsilon aminocaproic acid is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Its excretion into breast milk is also unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take epsilon aminocaproic acid with food?** A: The oral form can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store epsilon aminocaproic acid?** A: Store according to the label directions, typically in a cool, dry place.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration and the specific condition being treated.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking it abruptly?** A:  No, you should never stop taking epsilon aminocaproic acid without consulting your doctor first.  Sudden discontinuation may lead to a recurrence of bleeding.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
