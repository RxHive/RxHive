# Ezogabine
### Generic Name
Ezogabine (also known as Retigabine)

### Usage
Ezogabine is an anticonvulsant medication used as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults (18 years and older).  This means it's used *in addition* to other seizure medications when those medications alone aren't effectively controlling seizures.  It's prescribed only when the potential benefits outweigh the risks, particularly the risk of retinal abnormalities and potential vision loss.  It is not a first-line treatment for seizures.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥18 years):**  Ezogabine is administered orally in three divided doses daily.

* **Partial-onset seizures:** The starting dose is typically 100 mg three times a day (TID).  The dose can be gradually increased by a maximum of 150 mg/day at weekly intervals, based on individual response and tolerability, up to a maximum of 400 mg TID (1200 mg/day).

* **Geriatric patients (≥65 years):**  Start with a lower dose of 50 mg TID. Increase in the same manner as above, but with a maximum dose of 250 mg TID (750 mg/day).

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Consult prescribing information for specific guidelines.

* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for CrCl <50 mL/min and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis. Consult prescribing information for specific guidelines.  Patients on hemodialysis require a supplemental dose immediately following dialysis, and an additional dose may be needed at the start of subsequent sessions if breakthrough seizures occur.


**Children (<18 years):** The safety and effectiveness of ezogabine have not been established in children.

**Important Note:**  The medication should be swallowed whole; do not crush, break, chew, or dissolve the tablets.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Confusion
* Ataxia (lack of muscle coordination)
* Tremor


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in <10% of patients, but warranting immediate medical attention):**

* Blurred vision
* Vision loss
* Retinal abnormalities (pigmentary changes, macular abnormalities)
* QT prolongation (abnormality on electrocardiogram)
* Severe skin reactions
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior
* Urinary retention
* Severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (hallucinations, psychosis)


A comprehensive list of side effects can be found in the full prescribing information.  If any concerning side effects occur, contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Ezogabine works by opening potassium channels in neurons (nerve cells). This action stabilizes the electrical activity of neurons, making them less likely to fire excessively and cause seizures.  It achieves this by increasing a stabilizing membrane current and preventing the bursts of action potentials associated with seizures. Ezogabine may also enhance the effects of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps calm nerve activity.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Ezogabine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ezogabine or its components.

* **Warnings:**  Ezogabine carries a boxed warning regarding the risk of retinal abnormalities and potential vision loss. Regular ophthalmologic monitoring (including visual acuity, dilated fundus photography, and optical coherence tomography) is crucial.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ezogabine can interact with other medications, particularly digoxin (it can increase digoxin levels) and alcohol (it increases the systemic exposure to Ezogabine, potentially worsening side effects).  It can also interfere with bilirubin levels in blood tests.  Changes to dosage may be necessary when used with some other antiepileptic drugs. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ezogabine is classified as a Category C drug during pregnancy (animal studies have shown adverse effects).  It's unknown if it's excreted in breast milk.  The decision to use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should involve careful consideration of the benefits and risks.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use caution in elderly patients, as they may be more susceptible to side effects. Dose adjustments are recommended.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney or liver function.

* **Sudden Withdrawal:**  Abruptly stopping ezogabine can increase seizure frequency.  Withdrawal should be gradual, over several weeks under the supervision of a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for ezogabine to work?** A:  The time it takes to see a therapeutic effect varies between individuals. It may take several weeks of treatment to achieve optimal seizure control.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking ezogabine?** A:  No, alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the risk of side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store ezogabine?** A: Store at room temperature and away from moisture and light. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking ezogabine?** A:  Long-term use may be associated with the risk of retinal abnormalities, which necessitates regular ophthalmologic monitoring. Other long-term effects are not completely established and will be determined by further research.
