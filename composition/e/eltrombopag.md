# Eltrombopag
### Generic Name
Eltrombopag

### Usage

Eltrombopag is primarily used to treat chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) in adults and children aged 1 year and older.  This condition involves a low platelet count due to the body's immune system mistakenly attacking its own platelets. Eltrombopag is prescribed when other treatments like corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy haven't been effective enough.

Importantly, Eltrombopag isn't used to simply normalize platelet counts; its goal is to raise the platelet count to a level that reduces the risk of bleeding.

Beyond ITP, Eltrombopag also has secondary uses:

* **Chronic Hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia:** It helps manage low platelet counts in patients with chronic hepatitis C, allowing them to start and continue interferon-based therapies.
* **Severe Aplastic Anemia:**  It's used in patients with severe aplastic anemia who haven't responded adequately to immunosuppressive therapy.  It may be used as a first-line treatment in conjunction with other treatments, or as a refractory treatment for patients whose condition doesn't improve with other therapies.


### Dosage

Eltrombopag dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, ethnicity, and response to the medication.  Precise dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  The following provides general guidelines and should not be interpreted as a prescription:

**Adults:**

* **ITP:**  The initial oral dose is typically 50 mg daily, but this is reduced to 25 mg daily for patients of Asian ethnicity (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese). The dose is adjusted based on the patient's platelet response, with a maximum daily dose of 75 mg.
* **Chronic Hepatitis C-associated thrombocytopenia:** The initial oral dose is 25 mg daily, titrated up to a maximum of 100 mg daily based on platelet response. Treatment is discontinued once antiviral therapy ends.
* **Severe Aplastic Anemia (first-line):** The initial oral dose is 150 mg daily for six months (75 mg daily for patients of Asian ethnicity). This is given concurrently with standard immunosuppressive therapy.
* **Severe Aplastic Anemia (refractory):** The initial oral dose is 50 mg daily (25 mg daily for patients of Asian ethnicity), titrated up to a maximum of 150 mg daily, based on the response.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is determined by weight and condition and is significantly different for ITP versus severe aplastic anemia.  Consult a physician for precise guidance on pediatric dosing.  Generally, lower starting doses are used for children of Asian ethnicity.

**Important Note:**  Eltrombopag comes in tablet and oral suspension forms.  Administration instructions differ between these forms.  Always follow the provided instructions carefully.  Dosage adjustments are frequently made based on blood tests monitoring platelet counts and liver function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These are the side effects that occur most frequently.

* Abnormal liver function test results
* Upper respiratory tract infections (like colds)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Thromboembolic events (blood clots in veins or arteries, such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, or heart attack).  This is a significant concern and necessitates immediate medical attention.
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):  This can range from mild to severe, potentially leading to liver failure. Regular liver function tests are essential.
* Skin rash or alopecia (hair loss)
* Cataracts


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist.  Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce platelets.  Eltrombopag mimics the action of TPO by binding to and activating the TPO receptor on the surface of bone marrow cells. This activation leads to increased platelet production, helping to raise low platelet counts.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Eltrombopag is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and in those with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Eltrombopag can interact with several other medications. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Liver Function:** Eltrombopag can cause liver damage (hepatotoxicity). Regular monitoring of liver function tests is necessary, and the medication may need to be stopped or the dose adjusted if liver problems occur.  This is especially important in patients with pre-existing liver conditions or those taking it in conjunction with interferon and ribavirin for hepatitis C.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Eltrombopag is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established. Effective contraception is recommended for women of childbearing age during treatment. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Eltrombopag.
* **Thromboembolic Risk:**  Eltrombopag can increase the risk of blood clots.  Patients with a history of blood clots or risk factors for blood clots should be carefully monitored.
* **Cataracts:** Eltrombopag may increase the risk of cataracts or worsen existing ones. Regular eye examinations may be recommended.
* **Asian Ethnicity:**  Patients of Asian ethnicity may experience higher drug exposure and require lower starting doses.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Eltrombopag with food?** A:  It's recommended to take Eltrombopag on an empty stomach or with a low-calcium meal. Avoid high-calcium foods and antacids near the time of administration.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes for Eltrombopag to work varies depending on the condition and individual response.  It can take several weeks to see a significant increase in platelet counts.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider for guidance. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How should I store Eltrombopag?** A: Store Eltrombopag as directed on the product label.  Generally, this means storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Eltrombopag abruptly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Eltrombopag without consulting your healthcare provider.  Stopping abruptly may negatively impact your condition.
