# Eltrombopag

**Generic Name:** Eltrombopag

**Usage:** Eltrombopag is used to increase platelet counts in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who have not responded adequately to other treatments.  It's also used to increase platelet counts before and after certain surgeries or medical procedures in adults with ITP. Additionally, it's approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adults with hepatitis C who are receiving interferon- and ribavirin-based therapy and have not responded adequately to other treatments.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects of eltrombopag include:

* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint.
* **Upper respiratory tract infection:**  Common cold symptoms.
* **Muscle pain:**  Aches or pains in the muscles.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation.
* **Vomiting:** Throwing up.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty having bowel movements.

More serious, but less common side effects include:

* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):** Liver enzyme elevations are common, but severe liver damage is rare.  Regular liver function tests are necessary while taking eltrombopag.
* **Thrombosis (blood clots):**  Increased risk of blood clots, particularly in patients with a history of clotting disorders.
* **Serious allergic reactions:**  These are rare but can be life-threatening.
* **Tumor development (rare):** While very rare, an increased risk of certain types of tumors has been observed in some studies.

**How it Works:** Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist.  Thrombopoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Eltrombopag mimics the action of thrombopoietin, binding to its receptor and triggering the bone marrow to produce more platelets.  This helps to increase the platelet count in individuals with low platelet counts due to conditions like ITP or hepatitis C treatment-related thrombocytopenia.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is eltrombopag taken?** A: Eltrombopag is typically taken orally as a tablet once daily. The specific dosage will be determined by your doctor.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The increase in platelet count usually begins within a few days to a few weeks of starting treatment.

* **Q: What are the contraindications?** A:  Eltrombopag should not be used in patients with severe liver disease, or those who are hypersensitive to eltrombopag or any of its ingredients.  It should also be used cautiously in patients with a history of blood clots.

* **Q:  What should I tell my doctor before taking eltrombopag?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Also disclose any medical conditions you have, especially liver disease, a history of blood clots, or any allergies.

* **Q:  What are the potential drug interactions?** A: Eltrombopag can interact with other medications.  Your doctor will need to assess potential drug interactions before prescribing eltrombopag.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking eltrombopag?** A:  Alcohol consumption should be limited or avoided while taking eltrombopag, as it can potentially worsen liver function.  Discuss this with your doctor.
