# Estrone
### Generic Name
Estrone

### Usage
Estrone is primarily used for the short-term treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (thinning and inflammation of the vaginal walls) caused by estrogen deficiency.  This is often experienced by women after menopause.  It's crucial to note that in women with a uterus, estrone should always be used in combination with a progestin to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining), which can lead to cancer.  Estrone is also used orally, often in combination with other estrogens (like estradiol and estriol), as part of menopausal hormone replacement therapy (MHT) and for the prevention of osteoporosis (weakening of bones).  However, the use of MHT carries risks and should be carefully considered with a healthcare provider.

### Dosage

**Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy (Intravaginal):**

* **Cream (1mg/g):**  The typical dose is 0.5 to 4 grams daily.  The lowest effective dose to control symptoms should be used. Treatment is usually cyclical â€“ 3 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week off.  Long-term use isn't recommended.  Remember to use a progestin concurrently if you have a uterus.

**Menopausal Hormone Replacement Therapy & Osteoporosis Prevention (Oral):**

* The usual oral dose is 1.4 to 2.8 mg per day, often administered cyclically or continuously. This is typically given in conjunction with estradiol and estriol.  If a woman has a uterus, cyclical progestin should be added for 12 to 14 days of each cycle.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Estrone is not approved for use in children.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Breast tenderness
* Abdominal pain
* Fluid retention
* Breakthrough bleeding or spotting (vaginal)


Less common but serious side effects include:

* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
* Stroke
* Heart attack
* Liver damage (jaundice)
* Increased blood pressure
* Changes in glucose tolerance
* Worsening of migraine headaches or epilepsy
* Cancer (breast, endometrial, ovarian)


**If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, stop using estrone and contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works
Estrone is a type of estrogen.  It works by binding to estrogen receptors within cells throughout the body, primarily in the reproductive organs, breasts, and brain. This binding triggers a series of events that affect gene expression, influencing various bodily functions.  In the context of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, it helps restore the vaginal lining's thickness and moisture.  In MHT, it helps alleviate menopausal symptoms and reduce the risk of osteoporosis by supporting bone density.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Estrone is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a history of breast cancer, estrogen-dependent tumors, undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding, active or history of blood clots (thromboembolic events), liver disease,  or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  It should also be avoided in patients with certain types of migraines and porphyria (a blood disorder).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Estrone's effects can be altered by certain medications, including those metabolized by the liver (CYP enzymes).  Discuss all current medications, including herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting estrone.  Some medications can reduce estrone's effectiveness, while others may increase the risk of side effects.

* **Specific Populations:**  Caution should be exercised when using estrone in older adults, those with a history of heart disease, liver or kidney problems, diabetes, epilepsy, and those with a family history of blood clots.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose is crucial.

* **Regular Check-ups:**  Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider are vital, especially during estrone therapy.  This allows for monitoring for potential side effects and evaluating the ongoing need for treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I use estrone?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated and your individual response.  For vulvar and vaginal atrophy, it's generally short-term.  For MHT, it should be reviewed annually with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I stop estrone suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop using estrone abruptly.  Gradual tapering under your doctor's supervision is recommended to prevent withdrawal symptoms or complications.

* **Q: How should I store estrone?** A: Store estrone as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.  However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I use estrone if I have a uterus?** A: If you have a uterus, you should use estrone *in combination with a progestin* to protect your uterine lining from potential thickening. Your doctor will help determine the appropriate combination.

* **Q: Are there alternatives to estrone?** A: Yes, there are other estrogen therapies and alternative treatments for vulvar and vaginal atrophy and menopausal symptoms. Your doctor can discuss these options with you.  It's important to weigh the risks and benefits of any treatment based on individual circumstances and health conditions.
