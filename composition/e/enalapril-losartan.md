# Enalapril + Losartan
### Generic Name: Enalapril/Losartan Combination

This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting, stopping, or altering any medication.

**Note:**  A fixed-dose combination of enalapril and losartan is not a standard, widely available generic medication in the same way that individual enalapril or losartan medications are.  Doctors may prescribe these two drugs together, but it's usually in individually-dosed forms, not a single pill containing both.  This information will therefore address each drug individually and then discuss their combined use.


### Usage

**Enalapril:** This is an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. It can also be used after a heart attack to reduce the risk of death and other complications.

**Losartan:** This is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  It's also primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), and it's also used to slow the progression of diabetic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.


When used together: The combination of enalapril and losartan is often prescribed for patients with hypertension who haven't achieved adequate blood pressure control with a single medication.  The combined action of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB provides a more potent effect on lowering blood pressure than either drug alone.  This synergistic effect can be particularly beneficial in patients with resistant hypertension.

### Dosage

Dosage of enalapril and losartan depends heavily on individual factors like age, weight, kidney function, and the severity of the condition.  **It is crucial to follow the doctor's prescription precisely.** There is no standard "combined" dosage because the drugs are typically prescribed separately.

**Enalapril:**
* **Oral:** Dosage varies widely, typically starting at low doses and gradually increasing as needed.  Children’s dosage is determined by weight and condition. 
* **IV:** Enalapril is available in IV form, generally used in hospital settings for specific conditions. Dosage is determined by a physician based on individual needs.

**Losartan:**
* **Oral:** Dosage varies, usually starting low and adjusted based on blood pressure response.  Children’s dosage is weight-based.
* **IV:** Losartan does not have an IV formulation.

### Side Effects

**Enalapril:** Common side effects include dizziness, lightheadedness, dry cough, fatigue, and nausea.  Less common but serious side effects include angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), kidney problems, and low blood pressure.

**Losartan:** Common side effects include dizziness, lightheadedness, and diarrhea.  Less common but serious side effects include low blood pressure, kidney problems, and changes in blood counts.


**Combined Side Effects:** When taking both medications, the likelihood of experiencing some of these side effects may increase.

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

**Enalapril:**  It works by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which reduces the production of angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow, increasing blood pressure. By blocking ACE, enalapril helps to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure.

**Losartan:** It works by blocking the action of angiotensin II directly by preventing it from binding to its receptors in blood vessels. This also leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and lower blood pressure.

The combined effect of enalapril and losartan provides a more comprehensive approach to blood pressure control by targeting the renin-angiotensin system from two different points.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Both enalapril and losartan should generally be avoided during pregnancy, particularly during the second and third trimesters, due to potential harm to the developing fetus.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Both drugs can affect kidney function, and dosage adjustments are often needed in patients with kidney problems.
* **Liver Disease:**  Losartan metabolism is affected by liver function, requiring dosage adjustments in patients with liver disease.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Allergic reactions, including angioedema, are possible with both medications.
* **Other Medications:**  Both enalapril and losartan can interact with other medications, including potassium supplements, diuretics, and other blood pressure medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of these medications.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking these medications suddenly?**  A: No, stopping abruptly can be dangerous.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **Q: How should I store these medications?**  A: Store them as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Are there any food restrictions while taking these medications?** A: No specific dietary restrictions are usually required, but maintaining a healthy diet is always beneficial for blood pressure management.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking these medications?** A: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally fine, but excessive alcohol can lower blood pressure excessively and may interact negatively with the drugs. Consult your physician.
