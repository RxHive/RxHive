# Enalapril
### Generic Name
Enalapril

### Usage

Enalapril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children over one month old.  It's a highly effective medication that helps lower blood pressure and reduces the strain on the heart.  Beyond hypertension, enalapril also plays a crucial role in managing symptomatic heart failure.  This means it helps individuals experiencing symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue due to weakened heart function.  Furthermore, it's used to reduce the risk of developing overt heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (a weakened heart muscle that isn't yet causing noticeable symptoms), and to decrease the likelihood of hospitalization for heart failure.  In some cases, it may be used off-label for conditions such as renal failure (kidney disease), particularly in non-diabetic patients and certain types of hereditary kidney disease.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**  Dosage for heart failure typically starts low (2.5 mg twice daily) and is gradually increased under medical supervision, reaching a maximum of 40 mg daily in divided doses.  For hypertension, the starting dose might be higher (5 mg once daily), again adjusted based on response.  Intravenous (IV) administration is possible but is generally reserved for specific situations and administered under close medical supervision, typically in a hospital setting. Dosage adjustments are often necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight in mg/kg and are significantly lower than adult doses.  Again, precise instructions must come from a healthcare professional, taking into account the child's age, weight, and specific condition.  Specific off-label uses may also necessitate different dosage regimes.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney and liver function significantly affect how the body processes enalapril.  Lower doses are usually prescribed for individuals with impaired kidney or liver function to prevent adverse effects.  The medication is partially removed by dialysis, which needs to be considered in dosage adjustments for patients undergoing dialysis.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients) can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dry cough
* Nausea
* Changes in taste
* Increased serum creatinine (a marker of kidney function)

Less common but more serious side effects:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) – this is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Renal failure (kidney failure)
* Changes in blood counts (including low white blood cell counts)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  ACE is an enzyme that plays a key role in regulating blood pressure by converting angiotensin I (an inactive molecule) into angiotensin II (a powerful vasoconstrictor).  Enalapril blocks this conversion, leading to decreased angiotensin II levels. This results in vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and lessening the workload on the heart.  The medication also reduces aldosterone secretion (a hormone that affects sodium and water retention), contributing further to blood pressure lowering and reducing fluid buildup.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Enalapril is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema (especially related to prior ACE inhibitor use), hereditary angioedema, or hypersensitivity to enalapril or its components.
* **Interactions:** Enalapril can interact with many other medications, including other blood pressure medications, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and potassium supplements.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Enalapril is a Category D drug during pregnancy, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus.  It should be avoided during pregnancy, unless absolutely necessary under strict medical supervision.  It’s also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should consult their doctor.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to certain side effects, especially hypotension.
* **Surgery:** Enalapril might need to be temporarily discontinued before or after major surgery.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take enalapril with alcohol?** A: While not explicitly contraindicated, combining enalapril with alcohol can increase the risk of low blood pressure and dizziness.  Moderate your alcohol consumption or avoid it altogether while taking enalapril.

* **Q: How should I store enalapril?** A: Store enalapril in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking enalapril suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping enalapril can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always taper off the medication gradually as directed by your healthcare provider.

* **Q: What if I experience angioedema?** A: Angioedema is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.  Contact emergency services right away.
