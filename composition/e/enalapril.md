# Enalapril

**Generic Name:** Enalapril

**Usage:**

Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) primarily used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It helps lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels.
* **Heart failure:** It helps reduce the workload on the heart and improve its function.
* **After a heart attack (myocardial infarction):** It helps reduce the risk of death and further heart damage.
* **Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease related to diabetes):**  It helps slow the progression of kidney damage in some patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Dry, persistent cough:** This is a relatively common and sometimes troublesome side effect.
* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:** Especially when starting treatment or increasing the dose.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Muscle cramps:**
* **Changes in taste:**
* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels):**  Especially in patients with kidney problems.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can cause dizziness and fainting.
* **Kidney problems:**  Especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Liver problems:**
* **Neutropenia (low white blood cell count):**  Increases risk of infection.
* **Serious allergic reactions:**


**How it Works:**

Enalapril works by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is involved in the body's production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure and putting extra strain on the heart. By inhibiting ACE, enalapril reduces the amount of angiotensin II, leading to:

* **Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels):**  This lowers blood pressure.
* **Reduced workload on the heart:**  This improves heart function.
* **Reduced fluid retention:**  This helps to reduce swelling and improve heart function.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking enalapril?**  It's best to limit alcohol consumption while taking enalapril, as alcohol can worsen the side effects, particularly hypotension.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Can I stop taking enalapril suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking enalapril suddenly, as this can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose before stopping the medication completely.
* **Can I take enalapril with other medications?**  Tell your doctor about all the medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, as some medications can interact with enalapril.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs of an allergic reaction can include skin rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.
* **How long does it take to work?** It may take several weeks to see the full effects of enalapril.
