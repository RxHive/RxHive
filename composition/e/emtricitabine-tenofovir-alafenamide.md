# Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Alafenamide
### Generic Name
Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Alafenamide

### Usage

Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide is a combination drug primarily used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children.  It's also used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV-1 acquisition in at-risk adults.  Importantly, this specific combination is *not* approved for PrEP to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in all high-risk adults; consult guidelines for specific recommendations.  Off-label, it's sometimes used in treating HIV-1 infection in individuals also infected with Hepatitis B, but close monitoring is crucial due to the risk of Hepatitis B exacerbation upon discontinuation.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  The typical dose is one 200 mg/25 mg tablet (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) once daily. This is usually taken in combination with other antiretroviral medications for HIV-1 treatment. For PrEP, the same dosage applies.

**Children and Adolescents:**  For children and adolescents weighing 25 kg or more, the dosage is also one 200 mg/25 mg tablet daily.  For PrEP in this age group, the weight threshold is typically higher (â‰¥35 kg).  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with renal impairment. Always follow a healthcare provider's guidance on pediatric dosing, as it depends on weight and other factors.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are generally not necessary for individuals with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. However, its use is not recommended for those with severe hepatic impairment. Renal impairment significantly impacts dosing; consult a healthcare provider for guidance, as usage is often not recommended for those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 30 mL/minute.  Specific adjustments exist for those on hemodialysis.

**Administration:**  The tablets are typically taken orally, with or without food.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Abdominal pain
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Decreased bone mineral density


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Increased serum triglycerides
*   Exacerbation of Hepatitis B (especially upon discontinuation)
*   Skin rash
*   Urticaria
*   Fanconi syndrome
*   Proximal tubular nephropathy
*   Acute kidney injury
*   Renal tubular necrosis
*   Angioedema

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are both antiretroviral medications that belong to a class called nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  They work by interfering with the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial for HIV replication.  By inhibiting this enzyme, the drugs prevent the virus from converting its RNA into DNA, thereby halting the viral life cycle and reducing the viral load.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated for PrEP in individuals with unknown or confirmed HIV-1 positive status.

*   **Drug Interactions:**  Several medications can interact with this drug combination, affecting its efficacy or increasing the risk of side effects.  These include certain protease inhibitors, anticonvulsants, antibiotics (like rifampin), and St. John's Wort.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

*   **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), lactic acidosis/hepatomegaly, and renal toxicity.  A boxed warning highlights the risk of severe Hepatitis B exacerbation upon discontinuation in those with HIV/Hepatitis B co-infection.  There's also a risk of developing drug-resistant HIV-1 variants if used for PrEP without proper monitoring and confirmation of HIV-negative status.

*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety and efficacy during pregnancy haven't been fully established. Breastfeeding is not recommended for women with HIV infection due to the risk of transmission.

*   **Specific Populations:**  Close monitoring is necessary in patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and those with pre-existing kidney or liver disease.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take this medication with food?** A: Yes, it can be taken with or without food.

*   **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
