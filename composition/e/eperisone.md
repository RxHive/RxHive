# Eperisone
### Generic Name
Eperisone

### Usage
Eperisone is a muscle relaxant primarily used to relieve muscle stiffness and pain associated with various conditions.  Its main applications are in treating myotonic symptoms (muscle spasms and stiffness) related to neck-shoulder-arm syndrome, scapulohumeral periarthritis (inflammation of the shoulder joint), and low back pain.  It's also indicated for managing spastic paralysis (muscle stiffness and spasms) stemming from conditions like cerebrovascular disorders (stroke), spinal cord injuries, cervical spondylosis (neck osteoarthritis), and other neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis.  Post-surgical spasticity and spasticity from trauma are also potential treatment areas.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and formulation (immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, or granules).  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Myotonic symptoms:**
    * Immediate-release tablets: Typically 50 mg three times daily (TID).
    * Extended-release tablets: Typically 75 mg twice daily (BID).
    * Granules (10%):  Typically 1.5 g (equivalent to 150 mg of eperisone hydrochloride) TID.

* **Spastic paralysis:**
    * Immediate-release tablets: Typically 50 mg TID.
    * Granules (10%): Typically 1.5 g (equivalent to 150 mg of eperisone hydrochloride) TID.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of eperisone in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with renal impairment. For those with hepatic (liver) impairment, use caution and consult a doctor.


### Side Effects

* Nervous system: Drowsiness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, malaise, numbness in extremities, dizziness, staggering.
* Skin: Rash.

**Less Common (<1%):**  Anemia, sweating, swelling, abdominal enlargement, various skin reactions (including erythema multiforme), hiccups, elevated blood urea nitrogen, increased urine residual volume, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, ALP, AST), muscle hypotonia, palpitations, protein in urine, itching, stiffness, mouth sores, tremors, urinary incontinence, urinary retention.

**Serious but Rare (Postmarketing):** Anaphylactic shock, anaphylaxis, non-immune anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these severe reactions.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Report any unusual or concerning side effects to your doctor or pharmacist.


### How it Works
Eperisone works by reducing the sensitivity of muscle spindles. Muscle spindles are sensory receptors within muscles that contribute to muscle tone and reflexes. By suppressing the activity of gamma motor neurons (which control muscle spindle sensitivity), eperisone helps relax overactive muscles. It also has a vasodilatory effect, meaning it widens blood vessels, potentially improving blood flow to muscles.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Eperisone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or any of its components and those with myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disorder).
* **Interactions:**  Eperisone can interact with various medications, including alcohol and other central nervous system depressants (sedatives, opioids, etc.).  It may also interact with other drugs affecting the nervous system or muscles.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of eperisone during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown. Avoid use during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking eperisone.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Eperisone can cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take eperisone with alcohol?** A: No, avoid alcohol while taking eperisone, as it can enhance its sedative effects.
* **Q: How should I store eperisone?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking eperisone suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking eperisone without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation may be harmful.
* **Q:  Is eperisone addictive?** A:  Eperisone is not considered an addictive substance.
