# Eteplirsen
### Generic Name
Eteplirsen

### Usage
Eteplirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide medication specifically indicated for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).  It's used in patients with a confirmed mutation in the *DMD* gene that can be addressed through exon 51 skipping.  This means the drug is only suitable for a subset of DMD patients whose genetic defect allows for this specific type of treatment.  Eteplirsen works by modifying the genetic instructions within the cell, leading to the production of a partially functional dystrophin protein.  This protein is crucial for muscle health, and its partial restoration aims to slow disease progression.  There are currently no other approved uses for eteplirsen.

### Dosage

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy:**

* **Adults and Male Children ≥7 years:** The recommended dosage is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) once weekly over 35-60 minutes.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Due to the impact of reduced muscle mass on creatinine levels in DMD patients,  dosage adjustments based on renal function cannot be reliably determined.  


**Administration:** Eteplirsen is administered intravenously. The solution must be diluted before administration and infused through a 0.2-micron inline filter.  The infusion should be completed within 4 hours of preparation.  The IV line needs to be flushed with normal saline before and after the infusion.  A topical anesthetic cream might be used to reduce discomfort at the infusion site.  Eteplirsen should not be mixed with other medications or infused concurrently through the same IV line.  If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Equilibrium disturbance (problems with balance)
* Contact dermatitis (skin inflammation)
* Vomiting


**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Fever
* Flushing
* Hypersensitivity reaction (allergic reaction)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Urticaria (hives)


**Important Note:**  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Eteplirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide. It works by specifically binding to exon 51 of the dystrophin pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). This binding leads to the exclusion of exon 51 during the process of making mature messenger RNA (mRNA). By skipping exon 51, a shortened, but partially functional, dystrophin protein can be produced.  The resulting protein is not fully functional, but it is hoped that it will partially restore dystrophin function and slow the progression of DMD.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Eteplirsen can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, fever, flushing, cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension.  Patients should be monitored closely for these reactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Eteplirsen has not been studied in pregnant women. The decision to breastfeed during treatment should carefully weigh the potential risk of infant exposure against the benefits of breastfeeding and the treatment.
* **No Specific Contraindications:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not list any specific contraindications.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment with eteplirsen typically last?**  A: The duration of treatment is determined by a physician based on individual patient response and disease progression. It's an ongoing therapy.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?**  A: No significant drug interactions are currently reported in the manufacturer’s labeling.  However, always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Q: How is eteplirsen stored?** A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with the medication.

* **Q: Who should not take eteplirsen?** A:  Eteplirsen is not suitable for all DMD patients. Only those with a confirmed mutation in the *DMD* gene amenable to exon 51 skipping are candidates for treatment.  A genetic test is necessary to determine suitability.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Administer the missed dose as soon as possible, but do not double the dose.  Consult your doctor if you have any questions.
