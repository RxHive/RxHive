# Ethinyl Estradiol + Drospirenone
### Generic Name
Ethinyl Estradiol + Drospirenone

### Usage
Ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone is a combination birth control pill used primarily to prevent pregnancy.  It works by suppressing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary) and thickening the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg.  It also alters the uterine lining, making implantation less likely. While its primary use is contraception, some formulations may also be prescribed to treat moderate acne vulgaris in women who choose to use hormonal contraception.  It's important to note that this medication does *not* protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation and the patient's needs.  Most combination pills contain 20-35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 2-4 mg of drospirenone.  The pills are usually taken orally once daily at approximately the same time each day, following a 28-day cycle with a 7-day placebo or inactive pill phase during which menstruation typically occurs.  There are no IV forms of this combination medication.  

**Children:** This medication is not generally prescribed for children.  

**Adults:**  The typical adult dosage is one tablet daily as directed by a physician.  Missed pills should be addressed according to the specific instructions provided with the medication.  Skipping pills or irregular use can significantly reduce the effectiveness of the birth control pill.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Breast tenderness, bloating, weight changes, mood changes (including depression), nausea, headaches, spotting or breakthrough bleeding, changes in menstrual flow.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, liver problems, gallbladder disease, increased risk of certain types of cancers (e.g., breast cancer).  
* **Note:**  If you experience severe abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, sudden severe headaches, blurred vision, or leg pain, seek immediate medical attention.  Any unusual or persistent side effects warrant a consultation with your healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen that mimics the actions of the body's natural estrogen. Drospirenone is a synthetic progestin (progesterone-like hormone).  Together, they work by suppressing the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. This suppression prevents ovulation.  Additionally, these hormones thicken the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg, and they alter the uterine lining, reducing the chance of implantation.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, liver disease, or certain other medical conditions.  It should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Many medications can interact with ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone.  It is essential to inform your healthcare provider of all other medications, herbs, or supplements you are taking.  Certain antibiotics and anticonvulsants can reduce the effectiveness of the birth control pill.
* **Warnings:**  Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious side effects, particularly cardiovascular events.  Women who smoke should discuss the risks with their healthcare provider before using this medication.  Regular check-ups with your doctor are recommended while using this medication.
