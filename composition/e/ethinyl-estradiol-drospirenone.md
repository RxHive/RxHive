# Ethinyl Estradiol + Drospirenone

**Generic Name:** Ethinyl Estradiol + Drospirenone

**Usage:**  Ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone is a combination birth control pill used to prevent pregnancy.  It may also be used to treat symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and acne.  The specific formulation (dosage and brand) will dictate the exact approved uses.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:**  Breast tenderness, bloating, weight changes (gain or loss), mood changes (including depression or anxiety), headaches, nausea, vomiting, changes in menstrual bleeding (spotting, breakthrough bleeding, heavier or lighter periods), changes in libido.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), stroke, heart attack, high blood pressure, liver problems, gallbladder disease, increased risk of certain cancers (cervical, breast, possibly others), depression.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Serious allergic reactions.

This is not an exhaustive list. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and to discuss any concerns.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, sudden leg pain, vision changes, or severe abdominal pain.


**How it Works:**  This combination pill works by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen, and drospirenone is a synthetic progestin (progesterone).  The estrogen suppresses ovulation, while the progestin thickens the cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg) and alters the uterine lining, making implantation of a fertilized egg less likely.
