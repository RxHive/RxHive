# Ethyl Chloride
### Generic Name
Ethyl Chloride

### Usage
Ethyl chloride is primarily used as a topical local anesthetic.  Its primary application is for pain control during brief medical procedures such as injections (including intravenous line insertion and venipuncture), minor surgical procedures (like lancing boils or draining small abscesses), and the management of pain from minor sports injuries.  It's also used as a counterirritant to help relieve myofascial pain, restricted motion, and muscle tension.  The cooling effect provides temporary pain relief.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific application and the area being treated.  The medication is applied topically as a spray.

**Adults and Children (dosage is the same for both):**

* **Minor surgical procedures/pre-injection anesthesia/minor sports injuries:** Spray the affected area continuously for 3-7 seconds (from an amber bottle) or 4-10 seconds (from an aerosol can) from a distance of 3-9 inches. Continue spraying until the skin turns slightly white.  The duration of application will influence the total dose; always use the minimum amount needed for effective pain relief.

* **Myofascial pain (spray and stretch technique):** Spray the affected area in parallel sweeps 0.5-1 inch apart, at a rate of 4 inches per second from a distance of 12-18 inches, while simultaneously passively stretching the muscle. The number of sweeps will depend on the size of the muscle being treated.

**Important Note:**  Always follow the specific instructions provided with the product packaging.


### Side Effects
* Allergic skin reaction (rare)
* Skin discoloration (dyschromia) due to freezing
* Recall skin sensitization (affecting mucous membranes)

Serious side effects are uncommon but can include chronic poisoning (from skin absorption), liver and kidney damage (ethyl chloride is toxic to these organs), and severe allergic reactions.  Seek immediate medical attention if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works
Ethyl chloride works by rapidly evaporating when sprayed onto the skin. This rapid evaporation creates a significant and instantaneous drop in temperature, producing a cooling effect that temporarily numbs the area. This cooling effect reduces nerve conduction velocity, specifically impacting the C fibers and A-delta fibers responsible for transmitting pain signals to the central nervous system.  This interruption of pain signals provides temporary pain relief.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ethyl chloride is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to ethyl chloride or any components of the formulation.
* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of chronic poisoning if absorbed through the skin, as well as liver and kidney damage.  Allergic skin reactions are possible.  Avoid spraying in the eyes or inhaling the spray.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of ethyl chloride during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established. Use only when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.
* **Interactions:** Ethyl chloride may increase the adverse effects of bupivacaine and methemoglobinemia-associated agents.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is ethyl chloride flammable?**  A: Yes, it is flammable. Avoid use near open flames or electrical cautery equipment.

* **Q: How should I store ethyl chloride?** A: Store in a cool place at a temperature not exceeding 50°C (120°F).

* **Q: Can I use ethyl chloride on broken skin?** A: No, it's only intended for topical use on intact skin.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a side effect?** A: Stop using the product and contact a healthcare professional immediately.

* **Q: Is this a long-lasting anesthetic?** A: No, the numbing effect is temporary.
