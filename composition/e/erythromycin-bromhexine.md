# Erythromycin + Bromhexine
### Generic Name
Erythromycin + Bromhexine

**Note:**  Erythromycin and Bromhexine are often combined in over-the-counter cough and cold medications.  This information pertains to the combination;  individual drug profiles differ.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate dosage and precautions.  This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice. Consult a healthcare professional for any health concerns or before starting any medication.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat respiratory tract infections characterized by both bacterial infection and mucus production (phlegm).  Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, tackles the bacterial component by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thereby preventing bacterial growth. Bromhexine, a mucolytic expectorant, acts by thinning and loosening the mucus, making it easier to cough up. This dual action is designed to relieve symptoms such as a productive cough (cough with phlegm), chest congestion, and other respiratory discomfort associated with bacterial infections like bronchitis or pneumonia (when prescribed by a doctor).  The combination is often used for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.  It's crucial to understand that this is not a treatment for viral infections.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the manufacturer, and the patient's age and health condition.  There is no standard universal dosage for erythromycin + bromhexine. **Always follow the instructions provided on the product packaging or as directed by a healthcare professional.**  Dosage information found online or in general resources may not accurately reflect the product you're using.

* **Adults:** The dosage for adults is usually higher than for children and will be specified on the product label.  It's common to find that this combination is administered orally (tablets or syrup) several times daily, usually in divided doses.

* **Children:** Dosage for children is strictly dependent on weight and age.  Dosage is typically lower than for adults, and formulations may be available in liquid form (syrup) for easier administration to young children.  **Never administer adult-strength medication to children.**


* **IV Administration:** This combination is generally not administered intravenously (IV). Erythromycin can be given IV separately, but this would not typically be done in combination with bromhexine, which is primarily given orally.


### Side Effects

Common Side Effects:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Skin rash


Less Common but Serious Side Effects:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis â€“ a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Liver problems (jaundice, abnormal liver function tests)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)
* Changes in heart rhythm (especially with higher erythromycin doses)


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Erythromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial replication and thus eliminating the infection.  Bromhexine reduces the viscosity (thickness) of mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to expel through coughing. The combined effect targets both the bacterial cause and the symptomatic mucus production associated with respiratory infections.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not use if allergic to erythromycin, bromhexine, or any other components of the medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Erythromycin can interact with several medications, affecting their metabolism and effectiveness. Inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.  This is particularly important with drugs metabolized by the liver.
* **Liver Disease:**  Use with caution in patients with liver problems.  Regular liver function tests may be needed.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been thoroughly established.  Consult your doctor before using it during these periods.
* **Children:** Use only as directed by a pediatrician, especially in young children.
* **Elderly:** The elderly may be more susceptible to side effects.  Careful monitoring is advisable.
