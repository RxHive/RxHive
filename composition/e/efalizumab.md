# Efalizumab
### Generic Name
Efalizumab

### Usage
Efalizumab was a medication used to treat chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  It was specifically designed for individuals whose psoriasis wasn't adequately managed by other treatments.  However, it's important to note that **Efalizumab is no longer available on the market** due to safety concerns.  Its use is completely discontinued.


### Dosage
Because Efalizumab is no longer available, specific dosage information is not relevant.  If you have psoriasis, please consult a dermatologist or other healthcare professional to discuss appropriate treatment options currently available.


### Side Effects
Since Efalizumab is no longer marketed, a detailed list of side effects is less crucial.  However, it's important to remember that the primary reason for its removal from the market was the association with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but serious brain infection. Other side effects reported during its use included:

* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Headache
* Nausea
* Fatigue

This list is not exhaustive, and any significant or concerning side effect warrants immediate medical attention.  Consult your physician for complete information on potential side effects of any current psoriasis treatment.


### How it Works
Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called CD11a, found on the surface of white blood cells. By binding to CD11a, it prevents these cells from sticking to other cells and migrating to the skin. This action reduces the inflammation and overgrowth of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis.  In simpler terms, it inhibits the immune response that contributes to the development of psoriasis plaques.


### Precautions
Given Efalizumab's withdrawal, these precautions are primarily for historical context and understanding of the risk factors that led to its discontinuation.  The major concern was the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and often fatal brain infection.  Other precautions may have included interactions with other medications, although these details are less readily available since the drug is no longer in use.

**It is crucial to emphasize that Efalizumab should not be used.**  Any individual considering treatment for psoriasis must consult with a doctor to explore safe and currently available options.
