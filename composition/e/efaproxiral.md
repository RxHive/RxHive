# Efaproxiral
### Generic Name
Efaproxiral

### Usage
Efaproxiral is an experimental drug, meaning it's not currently approved for widespread clinical use.  It was investigated for a broad range of conditions, including depression, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), diabetes, hypoxia (low oxygen levels), sickle-cell disease, and hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol).  Its primary focus was exploring its potential to increase the effectiveness of certain chemotherapy drugs against hypoxic (oxygen-depleted) tumors.  The idea was that by increasing oxygen delivery to the tumor, it would make the chemotherapy more effective.  However, Phase III clinical trials did not demonstrate a benefit, and it is not currently approved for any therapeutic use.


### Dosage
Since Efaproxiral is not approved for medical use, there are no established dosage recommendations for adults or children.  Any information on potential dosages would be from pre-clinical or early clinical trial data and should not be interpreted as a prescription or recommendation for use.

### Side Effects
Because Efaproxiral never reached market approval, comprehensive information on its side effects in humans is limited.  The available data from clinical trials is insufficient to create a complete side effect profile.  Any potential side effects would need to be assessed within the context of clinical trial results.


### How it Works
Efaproxiral works by binding to hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This binding alters hemoglobin's structure, making it release oxygen more readily into tissues.  In the context of cancer treatment, the goal was to increase oxygen levels in hypoxic tumors, thereby enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy or certain chemotherapy drugs that require oxygen for optimal function.  The increased oxygen availability is meant to improve the effectiveness of these treatments without directly harming the tumor cells itself.


### Precautions
Because Efaproxiral is not an approved medication, there are no established precautions for its use.  Any potential precautions would need to be determined through further research and clinical trials.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is Efaproxiral currently available for purchase or prescription?**  A: No. Efaproxiral failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials and is not approved for medical use.

* **Q: What were the reasons for the failure of Efaproxiral in clinical trials?** A: The specific reasons for the failure of Efaproxiral in Phase III clinical trials aren't explicitly detailed in publicly available information.  It is likely that the drug did not provide a sufficient therapeutic benefit compared to existing treatments or exhibited unacceptable side effects.

* **Q:  Is Efaproxiral banned in sports?** A:  Efaproxiral's use was explicitly listed as a prohibited method by the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2012, though this is not due to performance-enhancing effects, but rather to prevent artificial manipulation of oxygen-carrying capacity.

* **Q: Where can I find more information on Efaproxiral?** A: More information can be found through scientific databases and published research articles relating to its pre-clinical and clinical trials.  However, remember that the drug is not approved for use, and any information found should be interpreted cautiously.

**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any treatment or medication.  The absence of information on dosage, side effects, and precautions reflects the fact that Efaproxiral is not an approved drug.
