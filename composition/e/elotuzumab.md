# Elotuzumab
### Generic Name
Elotuzumab

### Usage
Elotuzumab is a prescription medicine used to treat multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer.  It's specifically indicated for adult patients who have already received one to three prior therapies (in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone) and for those who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor (in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone).  Elotuzumab works by boosting the body's immune system to help fight myeloma cells. It doesn't cure multiple myeloma, but it can help control the disease and improve outcomes when used as part of a combination therapy regimen.


### Dosage
Elotuzumab is administered intravenously (IV) and the dosage varies depending on the combination therapy used and the treatment cycle.  Dosage information is complex and should be determined and administered only by a qualified healthcare professional.

**Multiple Myeloma (Relapsed/Refractory):**  Premedication with dexamethasone, an antihistamine (like diphenhydramine), and an H2 blocker (like ranitidine) and acetaminophen is usually given before Elotuzumab infusion.

* **With lenalidomide and dexamethasone:** The initial dosage is typically 10 mg/kg once weekly for the first two cycles, then reduced to 10 mg/kg every two weeks for subsequent cycles.  The infusion rate is carefully adjusted based on the patient's tolerance to avoid infusion reactions. Dexamethasone dosage is also adjusted according to the treatment cycle.
* **With pomalidomide and dexamethasone:** The initial dosage is 10 mg/kg once weekly for the first two cycles and then increased to 20 mg/kg once every four weeks for subsequent cycles. Again, the infusion rate is carefully adjusted, and dexamethasone dosage is adjusted based on age (â‰¤75 years vs >75 years) and treatment cycle.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary depending on factors like liver or kidney function.  A healthcare professional will determine if any adjustments are needed.  Infusion reactions can require interruption or slowing of the infusion rate.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Elotuzumab have not been established in children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Elotuzumab can include:

* Fatigue
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the arms and legs)
* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Nausea and vomiting
* Low blood counts (lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Infusion-related reactions (fever, chills, changes in blood pressure, fast or slow heart rate)
* Infections (including opportunistic infections)

Less common but serious side effects can include:

* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Second primary malignancies (new cancers)
* Acute kidney failure
* Severe allergic reactions


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Elotuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called SLAMF7 found on myeloma cells and natural killer (NK) cells.  By binding to SLAMF7, Elotuzumab enhances the ability of NK cells to recognize and destroy myeloma cells. This process involves both direct activation of NK cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), a mechanism where antibodies mark cancer cells for destruction by the immune system.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Elotuzumab is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Elotuzumab may interact with vaccines (both live and inactivated).  Consult your healthcare provider about vaccinations before, during, and after Elotuzumab treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Elotuzumab is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential harm to the fetus or infant and because it is used in combination with lenalidomide or pomalidomide, which are contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Strict adherence to contraception measures is essential.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments.  Close monitoring for infection and other side effects is crucial.
