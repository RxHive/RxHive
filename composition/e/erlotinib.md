# Erlotinib
### Generic Name
Erlotinib

### Usage

Erlotinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer.  In lung cancer, its use is specifically targeted to patients whose tumors have specific genetic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). These mutations are typically exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitutions.  Testing to confirm the presence of these mutations is essential before starting Erlotinib treatment.  Erlotinib can be used as a first-line treatment, maintenance therapy after initial treatment, or in later-line settings when the cancer progresses after other treatments.  

In pancreatic cancer, Erlotinib is used in combination with gemcitabine as a first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic disease.  It's important to note that Erlotinib's effectiveness in other EGFR mutations in lung cancer or in other cancer types hasn't been fully established.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the cancer being treated and other factors.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):** The typical adult dose is 150 mg once daily by mouth until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  This may be used in combination with other medications, such as ramucirumab (although this is considered off-label use in first-line treatment).

**Pancreatic cancer:** The typical adult dose is 100 mg once daily by mouth, taken in combination with gemcitabine, until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Erlotinib in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on factors such as liver or kidney function, and the severity of side effects.  For example, reduced doses or temporary treatment interruptions might be required if significant liver or kidney problems develop or if severe side effects like skin rash or diarrhea occur.  Your doctor will monitor your condition closely and make adjustments as needed.


### Side Effects

Erlotinib, like many cancer medications, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity of side effects can vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Fatigue
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Decreased appetite
*   Skin rash
*   Chest pain
*   Cough
*   Shortness of breath (dyspnea)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Severe skin reactions (bullous, blistering, or exfoliative dermatitis)
*   Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the lungs)
*   Severe diarrhea leading to dehydration
*   Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
*   Eye problems (keratitis, corneal ulceration)
*   Gastrointestinal perforation (a hole in the digestive tract)
*   Severe kidney problems (renal failure)
*   Increased risk of bleeding


**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Erlotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by blocking the activity of a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is often overactive in certain cancers. By inhibiting EGFR, Erlotinib prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, ultimately leading to their death.  The drug has a higher affinity for EGFR with specific mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitutions) which explains its targeted use in specific cancer types.


### Precautions

*   **Allergies:** Do not use Erlotinib if you are allergic to it or any of its ingredients.
*   **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Erlotinib should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney problems. Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function is necessary.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Erlotinib is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for two weeks after the final dose.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Erlotinib can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specific medications to be cautious of include CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, P-glycoprotein inhibitors, certain antibiotics, and drugs that alter stomach acid.
*   **Other Precautions:** Patients should avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. Smokers may require dose adjustments.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Erlotinib with food?** A:  No, it's recommended to take Erlotinib on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after eating.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
*   **Q: How should I store Erlotinib?** A: Store Erlotinib at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
*   **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor or pharmacist.  Some side effects may require dose adjustments or treatment interruption.
*   **Q: How long will I be on Erlotinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and disease progression. Your oncologist will determine the treatment duration.
