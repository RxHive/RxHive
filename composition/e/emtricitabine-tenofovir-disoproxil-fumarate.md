# Emtricitabine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

**Generic Name:** Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate

**Usage:**

Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a combination antiviral medication used to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and children (weighing at least 25 kg).  It's also used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults at high risk.  It is *not* a cure for HIV, but it helps to suppress the virus and improve the immune system's ability to fight off opportunistic infections.  It must be taken consistently as prescribed to be effective.  The specific dosage and regimen will vary depending on the individual's health status and the reason for its use (treatment or prevention).

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Stomach pain
* Skin rash

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Changes in kidney function (including acute kidney injury, especially in those with pre-existing kidney problems)
* Changes in bone mineral density (osteoporosis, bone fractures)
* Lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the blood, a potentially life-threatening condition)
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
* Pancreatitis
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.  The frequency and severity of side effects can vary from person to person.

**How it Works:**

Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  They work by interfering with the process by which HIV replicates within the body's cells.  Specifically:

* **Emtricitabine:**  Is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that inhibits the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV needs to replicate its genetic material.  It acts as a "fake" building block for the viral DNA, halting the replication process.

* **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate:** Is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI).  It's converted into tenofovir diphosphate inside cells, which then inhibits reverse transcriptase, similar to emtricitabine.


The combination of these two drugs provides a more powerful and effective approach to HIV suppression compared to using either drug alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of liver damage and should be avoided.  It's important to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take this medication if I have kidney problems?** A:  This medication can affect kidney function, so it's crucial to inform your doctor about any pre-existing kidney conditions.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary, or alternative medications might be considered.

* **Q: Is this medication safe during pregnancy?** A:  The use of this medication during pregnancy should be discussed with a doctor.  While generally considered safe, careful monitoring is needed to minimize potential risks to both the mother and the fetus.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A:  Treatment for HIV is typically lifelong.  For PrEP, the duration of use depends on individual risk factors and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A:  Yes, there can be drug interactions.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
