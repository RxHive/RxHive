# Emtricitabine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
### Generic Name
Emtricitabine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

### Usage

Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a combination antiretroviral medication primarily used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.  It's a crucial part of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, aiming to suppress the HIV virus and improve the quality of life for people living with HIV.  The combination works by targeting two key enzymes vital to the HIV virus's replication cycle, preventing it from multiplying within the body.  While its primary use is in HIV treatment, it's not a cure for HIV.  Consistent adherence to the prescribed regimen is vital for effective viral suppression and to reduce the risk of developing AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and related complications.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (brand name and form) and the patient's individual needs.  **It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions precisely.**  Generally, the adult dosage is one tablet taken orally once daily.  Children's dosage is determined by weight and age and requires careful calculation by a healthcare professional.  There is no intravenous (IV) formulation of this combination drug; it's administered orally only.  Different brands may have slightly different formulations (e.g., tablet strength), so check the packaging and follow the prescribed dosage instructions carefully.  Missing doses can significantly compromise the effectiveness of the treatment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Stomach pain
* Rash

Less common, but serious side effects that require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver problems (hepatitis)
* Kidney problems (renal impairment)
* Lactic acidosis (build-up of lactic acid in the blood)
* Changes in bone mineral density


**Always consult your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.**


### How it Works

Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate work synergistically to inhibit HIV replication.  Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). It interferes with the action of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme crucial to the HIV virus's ability to integrate its genetic material into the host cell's DNA. By blocking this process, emtricitabine prevents the virus from producing new copies of itself.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). It works in a similar fashion to emtricitabine, but with a slightly different mechanism.  It's converted into tenofovir diphosphate within the cells, which then directly inhibits reverse transcriptase, further hindering the virus's replication.  The combined action of these two drugs provides a powerful approach to suppressing HIV.


### Precautions

* **Kidney problems:** This combination is not suitable for individuals with pre-existing severe kidney disease. Regular monitoring of kidney function is essential during treatment.
* **Bone density:**  Long-term use can be associated with decreased bone mineral density.  Regular monitoring and discussion with a doctor are recommended.
* **Liver disease:** Caution is advised in patients with liver problems.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor regarding the risks and benefits of using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Drug interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided as it can increase the risk of liver damage.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication if I feel better?**  A: No.  Consistent treatment is crucial for effective HIV management. Stopping prematurely can lead to drug resistance and viral rebound.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.
* **Q: Is this medication a cure for HIV?** A: No, it's not a cure, but it effectively suppresses the virus, improving quality of life and preventing progression to AIDS.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive drinking is strongly discouraged, as it can increase the risk of liver damage. Always consult your doctor about alcohol consumption while on this medication.
