# Etonogestrel
### Generic Name
Etonogestrel

### Usage

Etonogestrel is primarily used as a long-acting reversible contraceptive for women.  It prevents pregnancy by working in multiple ways:  it suppresses ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), thickens the cervical mucus (making it harder for sperm to reach the egg), and thins the uterine lining (making it less hospitable for a fertilized egg to implant).  This medication is not indicated for use in men or children pre-menarche.

### Dosage

Etonogestrel is administered as a single subdermal implant.

**Adults:** A healthcare professional inserts one implant under the skin of the inner upper arm.  The implant is effective for up to three years and should be removed and replaced after three years if continued contraception is desired. The timing of insertion depends on the woman's contraceptive history. Ideally, insertion happens during days 1-5 of the menstrual cycle, even if bleeding persists.  If insertion isn't done at this ideal time, a backup barrier method of contraception (like condoms) should be used for seven days after insertion.  Pregnancy should be excluded before insertion if intercourse has occurred recently.

**Children:** Etonogestrel is only used in females who have begun menstruating (postmenarche). The dosage and administration are the same as for adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Etonogestrel is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustments are specified for renal impairment.  Specific insertion timing guidelines are provided for women switching from other hormonal contraceptives (combination or progestin-only), those who have recently had an abortion or miscarriage, and those using it postpartum (guidelines differ based on breastfeeding status). These instructions should be carefully followed and are detailed in the product information.

### How it Works

Etonogestrel is a progestin, a type of synthetic hormone similar to progesterone. It works by preventing ovulation, making the cervical mucus thicker and less permeable to sperm, and altering the uterine lining to make implantation of a fertilized egg less likely.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Etonogestrel is contraindicated in women with known or suspected breast cancer,  progestin-sensitive cancers, undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding,  a history of blood clots or thromboembolic disorders, liver tumors, active liver disease, or hypersensitivity to etonogestrel or any component of the formulation.

**Interactions:**  Many medications can interact with etonogestrel, potentially reducing its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  This includes certain anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, antibiotics, antifungals, and herbal remedies.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting etonogestrel.


**Warnings:**  Etonogestrel should be used with caution in women with diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors, depression, conditions exacerbated by fluid retention, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension, as well as in overweight women.  Pregnancy must be excluded before insertion. It does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is advisable, especially for early detection of any adverse effects.  Women should be aware of the signs and symptoms of blood clots and seek immediate medical attention if they develop any.  Women should also be aware that bleeding patterns may change.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Etonogestrel is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it's contraindicated during pregnancy.  While etonogestrel is excreted in breast milk, the decision to breastfeed while using the implant should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits of breastfeeding against potential infant exposure.  Insertion is generally not recommended until at least four weeks postpartum for breastfeeding women.
