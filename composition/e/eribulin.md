# Eribulin
### Generic Name
Eribulin

### Usage
Eribulin is a chemotherapy medication primarily used to treat metastatic breast cancer in adults who have already received at least two other chemotherapy regimens, including an anthracycline and a taxane.  This means it's typically used later in the course of breast cancer treatment when other options have been tried.  It's also approved for treating unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma (a type of soft tissue cancer) in adults who have previously had an anthracycline-based treatment.  While not officially approved for this, Eribulin is sometimes used off-label for other types of sarcoma, such as uterine leiomyosarcoma, particularly when other treatments haven't been successful.  It's crucial to discuss all treatment options with an oncologist to determine the most appropriate approach.


### Dosage
Eribulin is administered intravenously (IV).  The standard dose for both metastatic breast cancer and liposarcoma is 1.4 mg/m² given over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or unacceptable side effects develop.  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on factors such as liver and kidney function.  

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The starting dose is reduced for mild (Child-Pugh class A) and moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment.  Severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C) generally contraindicates its use.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage reduction is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 15 and 49 mL/min. Eribulin is generally not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  For patients on hemodialysis, 80% of the usual dose may be considered.

* **Obesity:**  The current ASCO guidelines suggest using actual body weight for dosage calculations in obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m²), especially when aiming for curative treatment.  Toxicity management should follow standard protocols.  Dosage adjustments for toxicity are outlined in the next section.

* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Eribulin in children under 18 have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% occurrence) of Eribulin include:

* Fatigue
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities)
* Headache
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST)
* Weakness
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)

Less common but serious side effects include:  QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm),  thrombocytopenia (low platelet count),  febrile neutropenia (fever with low white blood cell count),  and potentially severe allergic reactions (hypersensitivity).  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor. Microtubules are protein structures within cells that play a crucial role in cell division.  Eribulin works by binding to microtubules and preventing their normal function, which interferes with cell division and ultimately leads to cancer cell death.  Specifically, it inhibits the growth phase of microtubules, stopping the formation of the mitotic spindle and thus arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Eribulin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to eribulin mesylate, halichondrin B, or its derivatives.
* **Cardiotoxicity:** Eribulin may prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), increasing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms.  This risk is higher in patients with pre-existing heart conditions or those taking other medications known to prolong the QT interval.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Eribulin can suppress bone marrow function, leading to neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor blood cell counts.
* **Peripheral Neuropathy:**  Peripheral neuropathy is a common and potentially debilitating side effect. Careful monitoring and management are important.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Eribulin is harmful to a developing fetus and should not be used during pregnancy.  Effective contraception is mandatory during treatment and for at least two weeks after the final dose. Women should stop breastfeeding before starting treatment and for two weeks after the final dose.
* **Male Fertility:** Eribulin may affect male fertility. Males should use contraception during treatment and for 3.5 months after the last dose if their partner is of reproductive age.
* **Drug Interactions:** Eribulin can interact with other medications, particularly those that prolong the QT interval.  A healthcare provider should be informed of all medications being taken.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Eribulin stored?**  A:  Specific storage instructions should be found on the medication's packaging, but generally it should be kept at a controlled room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.  Do not attempt to adjust your dosage on your own.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Eribulin?** A:  Fatigue and peripheral neuropathy are common side effects that might affect your ability to drive safely. Follow your doctor’s recommendations.

* **Q:  How long will I be on Eribulin?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on individual response and tolerance. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Eribulin?** A: Some long-term effects are possible, such as persistent peripheral neuropathy.  Regular follow-up with your oncologist is essential to monitor for any potential long-term complications.
