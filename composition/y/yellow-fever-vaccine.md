# Yellow Fever Vaccine
### Generic Name
Yellow Fever Vaccine

### Usage
The yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated virus vaccine used for active immunization against yellow fever.  Its primary use is to protect individuals traveling to or residing in areas with a risk of yellow fever transmission.  This includes regions of Africa and South America.  Secondary uses may include protecting laboratory workers who handle the yellow fever virus and individuals whose travel plans necessitate vaccination as per international travel requirements.

### Dosage
**Adults and children ≥9 months old:** A single subcutaneous (SubQ) injection of 0.5 mL is recommended at least 10 days before travel to an endemic area.

**Infants aged 6 months to <9 months:** A single SubQ injection of 0.5 mL is also recommended at least 10 days before travel.  However, vaccination of infants in this age group should only be considered if the risk of yellow fever is high and the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  

**Booster Doses:**  The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) generally do not recommend routine booster doses. A single dose provides long-lasting immunity for most individuals.  However, booster doses may be considered for certain individuals, such as those with compromised immune systems (e.g., pregnant women, those with HIV, or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy) or those working with the virus in a laboratory setting, especially after prolonged periods in endemic areas.  The decision to administer a booster should be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Skin rash
* Headache
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Localized edema (swelling) at the injection site
* Pain at the injection site
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Weakness
* Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (a serious brain inflammation)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Brain disease
* Cranial nerve palsy (paralysis of cranial nerves)
* Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including asthma, dyspnea, bronchospasm, pharyngeal edema)
* Vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (rare)
* Vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (potentially fatal, affecting multiple organs)


If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
The yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine.  This means it contains a weakened form of the yellow fever virus.  After vaccination, the weakened virus triggers an immune response in the body.  The body produces antibodies that protect against future infection by the actual yellow fever virus.  This provides active immunity, meaning the body actively works to defend against the disease.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Allergy to egg or chick embryo protein, or any vaccine component, including gelatin.
* Infants under 6 months old (CDC/ACIP guidelines) or under 9 months old (manufacturer's recommendation).
* Severely immunocompromised individuals (e.g., those with HIV, leukemia, lymphoma, or other immune deficiencies).
* Individuals with a severe or febrile illness.
* Women breastfeeding infants younger than 9 months.


**Warnings/Precautions:**

* Use with caution in pregnant women; vaccination should only be considered if travel to high-risk areas is unavoidable. Women should wait 4 weeks after vaccination before becoming pregnant.
* Use with caution in the elderly (especially those who have not received the vaccine before) and those with asymptomatic HIV infection.
* The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously only.  Avoid intramuscular, intravenous, or intradermal injection.
*  Simultaneous administration with other vaccines (live or inactivated) is generally safe, but separate needles and syringes should be used.
*  Patients should be monitored for at least 15 minutes post-vaccination for anaphylaxis or syncope.
*  It's crucial to inform healthcare providers about all current medications and medical conditions before receiving the vaccine.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A:  The yellow fever vaccine typically provides lifelong immunity for most individuals.

* **Q: Can I receive the vaccine if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Vaccination is generally contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding infants under 9 months old. Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Most side effects are mild and temporary.  However, seek immediate medical attention if you experience serious side effects such as severe allergic reactions, neurological symptoms, or signs of organ failure.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with the vaccine.  It typically needs to be refrigerated.

* **Q: Is the yellow fever vaccine safe?** A: The yellow fever vaccine is generally safe and effective, but like all vaccines, it carries a small risk of side effects.  The benefits of protection generally outweigh these risks, especially in high-risk areas.

* **Q:  How long should I wait to donate blood after receiving the vaccine?** A: Wait at least two weeks after receiving the vaccine before donating blood.
