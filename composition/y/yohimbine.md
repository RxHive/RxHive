# Yohimbine
### Generic Name
Yohimbine

### Usage
Yohimbine is primarily used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men.  It works by affecting the nervous system to increase blood flow to the penis.  It's also sometimes used off-label for xerostomia (dry mouth), and as a weight-loss aid, although evidence supporting its effectiveness for these uses is less robust.  The use of yohimbine for weight loss is not widely accepted and needs further research.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use and individual patient factors.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescribed dosage precisely.  There is no standardized pediatric dosage, and its use in children is contraindicated.

* **Erectile Dysfunction:**  Oral administration is typical.  Dosage may range from 30 mg daily to a maximum of 50 mg daily, or it can be calculated based on weight (0.4 mg/kg, typically divided into three daily doses).  Dosages should be adjusted based on individual response and tolerance.  
* **Xerostomia:** Oral administration is common, with a typical dosage of 6 mg three times daily.
* **Weight Loss:**  Oral administration with a dosage of 20 mg per day is sometimes used off-label, but this use is not supported by substantial evidence and its safety in this context isn't fully established.


### Side Effects
Yohimbine can cause a range of side effects, some common and some less frequent but more serious.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.

* **Common:** Increased anxiety, irritability, and excitability.
* **Cardiovascular:**  High blood pressure (hypertension), abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), and worsening of existing heart conditions.
* **Other:** Skin rash, lupus-like syndrome (rare), bronchospasm.


### How it Works
Yohimbine is a competitive alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist.  In simpler terms, it blocks the action of certain receptors in the nervous system that normally constrict blood vessels.  By blocking these receptors, particularly in the brain and spinal cord, yohimbine increases norepinephrine release, leading to increased sympathetic nervous system activity and improved blood flow to the penis in men with erectile dysfunction.  The mechanism for other uses, such as xerostomia and weight loss, is not as well understood.


### Precautions
Yohimbine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Liver or kidney problems
* Pregnancy
* Children
* Panic disorder

Yohimbine can interact with numerous other medications, including antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs), antianxiety medications, antihypertensives, and others.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Individuals with existing cardiovascular conditions should exercise extreme caution, as yohimbine may worsen heart conditions.


### FAQs
