# Yellow fever virus live + attenuated

**Generic Name:** Yellow Fever Vaccine, Live Attenuated (e.g.,  YFV-17D strain is commonly used)

**Usage:**  Prophylactic vaccination against yellow fever virus infection.  It's recommended for travelers visiting or residing in areas with risk of yellow fever transmission, as determined by the CDC and WHO guidelines.  Some countries require proof of vaccination for entry.

**Side Effects:**  Most side effects are mild and temporary.  They may include:

* **Local reactions:** Pain, soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
* **Systemic reactions:** Headache, muscle aches, fatigue, fever, nausea.  These are more common in adults than children.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  Viscerotropic (affecting internal organs) and neurotropic (affecting the nervous system) reactions are exceedingly rare but potentially serious.  These are more likely in individuals with certain pre-existing conditions or immune deficiencies.  Anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions) are also possible, though rare.


**How it Works:** The vaccine contains a live, weakened (attenuated) strain of the yellow fever virus.  After vaccination, the attenuated virus replicates minimally in the body, stimulating an immune response. This response produces antibodies that protect against future infection with the wild-type yellow fever virus.  The immunity provided is typically long-lasting, often decades.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does immunity last?** A:  Most people develop long-lasting immunity, typically lasting for life, or at least 10 years, based on current understanding and research. A booster dose might be considered after 10 years depending on individual risk factors and travel plans.  Consult with a healthcare provider.

* **Q: Who shouldn't get the yellow fever vaccine?** A:  The vaccine is generally safe but contraindicated for certain individuals. This includes:

    * Infants less than 6 months of age.
    * Individuals with severely compromised immune systems (e.g., due to HIV/AIDS, cancer treatment, or certain medications).
    * Pregnant women (unless the risk of yellow fever infection is extremely high).
    * People with a history of severe allergic reaction to eggs or any vaccine components.
    * Individuals with certain neurological conditions or a history of neurological problems.  This necessitates careful evaluation by a physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives), unusual neurological symptoms, or any other concerning symptoms after receiving the vaccine.

* **Q: Is the yellow fever vaccine safe?** A:  Yes, the yellow fever vaccine has an excellent safety record.  While side effects are possible, serious complications are extremely rare.  The benefits of protection against yellow fever infection significantly outweigh the potential risks for most individuals.

* **Q: Can I get yellow fever from the vaccine?** A:  It's extremely unlikely to contract yellow fever from the attenuated vaccine. The virus is significantly weakened, making it incapable of causing disease in most healthy individuals.  However, very rare cases of viscerotropic and neurotropic reactions can occur.
