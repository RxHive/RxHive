# Yellow fever virus live + attenuated
### Generic Name
Yellow Fever Vaccine (Live, Attenuated)


### Usage
The yellow fever vaccine is used to prevent yellow fever, a serious viral hemorrhagic fever transmitted by infected mosquitoes.  It's primarily used for individuals traveling to or living in areas with a risk of yellow fever transmission, typically in tropical regions of Africa and South America.  The vaccine is recommended for both adults and children meeting the criteria set by health authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  There are no other notable secondary uses beyond yellow fever prevention.


### Dosage
The standard dose for both adults and children over 6 months of age is a single subcutaneous injection (0.5 mL).  There is no need for booster doses unless recommended by a healthcare professional based on individual risk factors or travel plans to high-risk areas.  Infants under 6 months old should not receive the yellow fever vaccine due to safety concerns.   Oral or IV administration is not applicable for this vaccine.  The vaccine is administered in a healthcare setting by a qualified healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are usually mild and temporary, including:

*   Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
*   Headache
*   Muscle aches
*   Fever
*   Fatigue
*   Nausea

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

*   Allergic reactions (such as hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
*   Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)
*   Viscerotropic disease (rare and serious complication affecting internal organs)
*   Neurotropic disease (rare complication affecting the nervous system)


If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works
The yellow fever vaccine contains a weakened (attenuated) form of the yellow fever virus.  This weakened virus triggers an immune response in the body, leading to the production of antibodies against the virus.  These antibodies provide protection against future infection by the wild-type yellow fever virus.  The vaccine doesn't cure yellow fever infection but prevents it from developing.


### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** The yellow fever vaccine should not be given to individuals with severe egg allergy (as it's grown in eggs), those with severely weakened immune systems (including those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing cancer treatment), or infants under 6 months of age.  Pregnant women should consult their doctor before receiving the vaccine.  It's also contraindicated for individuals with a history of allergic reaction to a previous yellow fever vaccination.
*   **Interactions:** The vaccine may interact with some medications that suppress the immune system. Discuss all current medications with your doctor before vaccination.
*   **Warnings:** Individuals should inform their doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions, especially those affecting the immune system, before receiving the vaccine.  Fever, aches, and other symptoms are common following vaccination, so rest and hydration are encouraged.   The vaccine is generally considered safe, but rare but serious complications can occur.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does the yellow fever vaccine last?**  A:  The yellow fever vaccine is generally effective for 10 years. After that period, a booster dose might be recommended, depending on travel plans and risk assessment.
*   **Q: Can I get yellow fever from the vaccine?** A:  The virus in the vaccine is weakened; therefore, the risk of contracting yellow fever from the vaccine is extremely low. However, mild symptoms are possible as the immune system responds to the vaccine.
*   **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A: The vaccine should be stored at a recommended temperature as specified by the manufacturer and healthcare provider to maintain its effectiveness.
*   **Q:  What if I have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue. This could be a life-threatening allergic reaction.
*   **Q: Is the yellow fever vaccine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  While generally safe, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctors before getting the vaccine.  The decision will be based on the individual's health and the potential risks and benefits.
