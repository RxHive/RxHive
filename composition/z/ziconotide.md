# Ziconotide
### Generic Name
Ziconotide

### Usage
Ziconotide is a prescription medication used to manage severe chronic pain in adults.  It's specifically indicated for patients whose pain is intractable (meaning it doesn't respond to other treatments) and who haven't found relief from other methods.  These other methods include systemic analgesics (pain relievers taken by mouth or injection), adjunctive therapies (additional treatments to enhance pain relief), or intrathecal morphine (morphine delivered directly to the spinal fluid). Ziconotide is administered directly into the spinal fluid (intrathecally) via an implantable pump.  It's not a first-line treatment for pain and is reserved for cases where other options have failed.

### Dosage
Ziconotide is administered intrathecally, meaning directly into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord, usually via a surgically implanted pump.  Dosage is highly individualized and carefully titrated (gradually increased) under close medical supervision.

* **Adults (Chronic Pain):** The initial dose is typically quite low, often starting at ≤2.4 mcg/day (≤0.1 mcg/hour), though some protocols may begin with an even lower dose of 0.5-1.2 mcg/day (0.02-0.05 mcg/hour). The physician will carefully monitor the patient's response to the medication and adjust the dose accordingly, typically in increments of ≤2.4 mcg/day (≤0.1 mcg/hour) at intervals of no more than 2-3 times per week.  The maximum dose is 19.2 mcg/day (0.8 mcg/hour) by day 21, though upward titration is recommended more cautiously and incrementally based on the individual's pain relief and tolerability, often in increments of no more than 0.5 mcg/day (≤0.02 mcg/hour) no more frequently than weekly.  More rapid titration should only be considered when the urgent need for pain relief outweighs potential risks.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of ziconotide in children have not been established.

Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specifically addressed in the prescribing information.  Safety and efficacy in these patient populations haven't been established.  If adverse effects such as cognitive impairment, reduced consciousness, or elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels with neuromuscular symptoms occur, the dosage may need to be reduced or the medication discontinued, as guided by the healthcare provider.


### Side Effects
The side effects of ziconotide can be significant and necessitate close medical monitoring.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Confusion

* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Speech disorder
* Headache
* Aphasia (difficulty with language)
* Hallucinations (visual or auditory)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Increased creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels
* Weakness
* Blurred vision


**Less Common, But Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 2-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**

* Various neurological and psychiatric effects (anxiety, depression, insomnia, paranoia, delirium, hostility, etc.)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Various gastrointestinal issues (anorexia, constipation, etc.)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Urinary retention, dysuria (painful urination), urinary hesitancy
* Tremor
* Muscle spasms, cramps, myalgia (muscle pain)
* Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)
* Diplopia (double vision)
* Visual disturbances
* Sinusitis
* Fever
* Serious side effects such as acute renal failure, aspiration pneumonia, stroke, seizures, and suicidal ideation have been reported.

**It is crucial to report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works
Ziconotide is an N-type calcium channel blocker.  N-type calcium channels are found on nerve cells involved in transmitting pain signals from the body to the brain (nociceptive afferent nerves). By blocking these channels, ziconotide prevents the release of neurotransmitters that cause the sensation of pain.  This reduction in pain signaling leads to pain relief.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ziconotide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or its components, a pre-existing history of psychosis, infection at the injection site, uncontrolled bleeding, or spinal canal obstruction impairing cerebrospinal fluid circulation. Intravenous administration is strictly contraindicated.
* **Interactions:** Ziconotide may enhance the central nervous system depressant effects of other medications, including analgesics (pain relievers), thalidomide, and pramipexole.  Concomitant use with minocycline may also enhance ziconotide's CNS-depressant effects.  Use caution and discuss with your doctor any other medications you're taking.
* **Warnings:** There is a boxed warning regarding the risk of serious neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, such as severe psychiatric symptoms and neurological impairment.  Patients with a pre-existing history of psychosis should not use this medication.  Close monitoring for cognitive impairment, hallucinations, and mood or consciousness changes is essential.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ziconotide is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Whether to discontinue breastfeeding while taking ziconotide should be carefully considered, as its excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Elderly Patients:** Use caution in elderly patients, as they may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Infection:**  There's an increased risk of meningitis and other infections with intrathecal administration.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is ziconotide administered?**  A: Ziconotide is administered intrathecally (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord) via a surgically implanted pump.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of effect varies, but pain relief is usually not immediate.  The dose needs to be titrated carefully over time.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ziconotide suddenly?** A:  Generally, ziconotide can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. However, it's crucial to discuss any discontinuation plans with your physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially those that are severe or concerning, to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: How is ziconotide stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider carefully.

* **Q: Is ziconotide addictive?** A: Ziconotide is not an opioid and does not have the same addictive potential as opioid pain medications. However, it is essential to use it as prescribed.
