# Zidovudine

**Generic Name:** Zidovudine

**Usage:** Zidovudine is an antiretroviral medication primarily used to treat HIV/AIDS.  It's often used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to slow the progression of the disease and improve the patient's quality of life.  It can also be used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery (perinatal transmission).

**Side Effects:**  Zidovudine can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:**  A frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:** Can be mild to moderate.
* **Vomiting:**  Can be associated with nausea.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can range in severity.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak.
* **Muscle pain:**  Aches and pains in the muscles.
* **Rash:**  Skin irritation.
* **Loss of appetite:**  Reduced desire to eat.
* **Shortness of breath:**  Difficulty breathing.
* **Anemia:**  Low red blood cell count. This is a more serious side effect and requires monitoring.
* **Neutropenia:** Low white blood cell count, increasing the risk of infection. This is a more serious side effect and requires monitoring.
* **Lactacidemia:** Buildup of lactic acid in the blood, a serious side effect.

**More serious side effects, though less common, require immediate medical attention.** These can include pancreatitis, liver problems, and severe allergic reactions.  Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor for these and other potential complications.


**How it Works:** Zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).  It works by interfering with the action of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV uses to replicate itself.  Specifically, zidovudine mimics a building block of DNA (thymidine). When the virus incorporates zidovudine into its DNA during replication, it halts further replication, thus inhibiting viral growth.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Zidovudine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur.  Zidovudine can interact with many drugs.

* **Q:  How is Zidovudine administered?** A: It's typically administered orally as a tablet or capsule.

* **Q: How long do I need to take Zidovudine?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the individual's condition and response to therapy.  It is usually a long-term treatment, often lifelong for HIV infection.

* **Q: Are there any precautions I should take while taking Zidovudine?** A: You should avoid activities that increase your risk of injury or bleeding (such as contact sports) due to the increased risk of anemia. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor immediately.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
