# Zoster Vaccine (Live/Attenuated)
### Generic Name
Zoster Vaccine (Live/Attenuated)

### Usage
Zoster vaccine (live/attenuated) is primarily used to prevent herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, in adults aged 50 years and older.  This vaccine uses a weakened form of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles.  It's crucial to understand that this vaccine is *not* used to treat existing shingles infections or postherpetic neuralgia (the persistent nerve pain that can follow shingles). It also does not prevent chickenpox.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage for adults 50 years and older is a single subcutaneous (subQ) injection of 0.65 mL.  The injection should be administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.  This vaccine is not approved for use in children or adolescents, and its safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.  No dosage adjustments are recommended based on hepatic or renal impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients) include pain, redness, swelling, and itching at the injection site.  Other side effects occurring in 1-10% of individuals include headache, diarrhea, asthenia (weakness), limb pain, and less frequently, cardiac failure and respiratory tract diseases.  Less common but serious side effects, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports, include anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and various other hypersensitivity reactions.  If any concerning side effects occur, it's vital to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
The zoster vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus. This creates active immunity, making the body better prepared to fight off future shingles infections. The attenuated (weakened) virus in the vaccine triggers an immune response without causing the illness itself.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  This vaccine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a history of anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions to the vaccine components (including gelatin and neomycin), those with immunosuppression or immunodeficiency (including certain cancers, HIV, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy), pregnant women, individuals with active untreated tuberculosis, and those undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplants or receiving specific immune modulators.

**Interactions:** Concurrent use with other live vaccines may interfere with the immune response. The use of antiviral drugs against herpesviruses (like acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir) should be avoided for 24 hours before and 14 days after vaccination.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions and syncope (fainting).  Transmission of the vaccine virus is also a potential concern, particularly to immunocompromised individuals.  Careful monitoring for these reactions is necessary.  Individuals with neoplastic disease or immunosuppression should be vaccinated with caution.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I get shingles after receiving the vaccine?** A: While the vaccine significantly reduces the risk, it doesn't offer 100% protection.  A mild case of shingles might still occur, but it is typically less severe than in unvaccinated individuals.

* **Q: How long does the vaccine last?** A:  The duration of protection provided by the vaccine isn't fully known, but studies suggest a significant level of protection for several years.

* **Q: Can I receive the vaccine if I have a mild cold?** A:  A mild illness usually doesn't necessitate delaying vaccination. However, if you have a more severe illness with fever, it is best to postpone vaccination until you recover.

* **Q:  What should I do if I faint after receiving the vaccine?** A:  Remain lying down until you feel better.  Inform the healthcare professional who administered the vaccine immediately.

* **Q:  How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your healthcare professional or on the vaccine packaging. Typically, live attenuated vaccines require refrigeration.

* **Q: Is the vaccine safe for breastfeeding mothers?** A: The vaccine is not contraindicated during breastfeeding, however, caution should be taken and this decision should be made while taking into consideration the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother.  Avoid pregnancy for at least 3 months after receiving the vaccine (4 weeks per CDC).
