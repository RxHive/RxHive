# Zinc Carnosine
### Generic Name
Zinc Carnosine

### Usage
Zinc carnosine is primarily used to treat gastric ulcers and lesions.  Its mechanism of action involves protecting the cells lining the stomach, promoting tissue repair, and aiding in wound healing within the gastrointestinal tract. While primarily used for gastric issues, research into its potential applications in other areas is ongoing.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For the treatment of gastric ulcers or lesions, the typical oral dosage is 75 mg twice daily (BID), usually taken after breakfast and before bedtime.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage information for children is not readily available from the provided data.  Always consult a healthcare professional for pediatric dosage instructions.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, it is crucial to consult a doctor in these cases, as individual needs may vary.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:** The frequency of these side effects is not clearly defined in available information.  However, reported side effects include:

*   Abdominal distention
*   Constipation
*   Nausea
*   Dyspepsia (indigestion)
*   Increased levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and lactate dehydrogenase (liver enzymes)
*   Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils in the blood)
*   Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
*   Increased levels of serum ALT and AST (liver enzymes)
*   Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
*   Urticaria (hives)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Post-marketing data and case reports indicate less frequent occurrences of:

*   Diarrhea
*   Heartburn
*   Pruritus (itching)
*   Skin rash
*   Vomiting
*   Hepatic insufficiency (liver failure)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the less common and potentially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Zinc carnosine functions as a cytoprotective agent in the gastric mucosa (the lining of the stomach).  It works by protecting the stomach lining cells from damage, promoting healing of existing lesions, and facilitating the repair of damaged tissue.  The exact mechanisms of its cytoprotective and wound-healing actions are still being investigated but are thought to be related to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling, but this doesn't mean it's suitable for everyone.  Always consult your doctor.
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of copper deficiency, hepatic dysfunction, and hypersensitivity reactions in some individuals.
* **Caution:**  Use with caution in elderly patients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Zinc carnosine may interact with several medications, including but not limited to baloxavir marboxil, bictegravir, bisphosphonates, ceftibuten, cephalexin, deferiprone, dolutegravir, eltrombopag, levothyroxine, penicillamine, quinolones, raltegravir, tetracyclines, and trientine.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with your other medications.
