# Zoster Vaccine Recombinant (Adjuvanted)
### Generic Name
Zoster Vaccine Recombinant (Adjuvanted)

### Usage
Zoster vaccine recombinant (adjuvanted) is used to prevent herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, in adults aged 50 years and older.  It's a crucial preventative measure, as shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox.  This vaccine is *not* used to treat existing shingles infections or postherpetic neuralgia (the persistent nerve pain that can follow shingles).  It also doesn't prevent chickenpox (primary varicella infection).

### Dosage
The recommended dosage for adults 50 years and older is a two-dose series administered intramuscularly (IM). The first dose is given at the initial visit, and the second dose is given 2 to 6 months later.  Each dose is 0.5 mL.  If the scheduled interval between doses is less than 4 weeks, the second dose should be repeated (per CDC/ACIP recommendations).  Delaying or interrupting the series doesn't require restarting; simply continue with the second dose as soon as possible within the recommended timeframe. The vaccine is not recommended for individuals under 50 years of age due to a lack of established safety and efficacy data in this younger population.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of recipients) include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Shivering
* Gastrointestinal (GI) upset
* Pain, erythema (redness), and swelling at the injection site
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Fever

Less common side effects (affecting 1-10% of recipients) include:

* Chills
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Dizziness
* Itching at the injection site
* Nausea
* Arthralgia (joint pain)

Rare side effects (less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance and/or case reports) include:

* Gout
* High fever
* Lymphadenitis (swollen lymph nodes)
* Optic neuropathy (damage to the optic nerve)

If you experience any concerning side effects, particularly serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
The Zoster vaccine recombinant (adjuvanted) works by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).  This enhanced immune response helps protect against the reactivation of the virus, which is the underlying cause of shingles.  The vaccine utilizes a recombinant form of the VZV glycoprotein E, which triggers a targeted immune response without causing the illness. The adjuvant in the vaccine helps to improve the immune response.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine.

**Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions and syncope (fainting). Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) should also be considered.

**Use with Caution:** The vaccine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of vaccine sensitivity or previous adverse reactions to vaccines, and in patients with existing or potential immune-mediated diseases.  Considerations should be given to delaying vaccination during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Drug Interactions:** Ocrelizumab (a medication used to treat multiple sclerosis) may reduce the effectiveness of this vaccine.  Discuss any medications you're taking with your doctor before vaccination.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I get shingles after receiving the vaccine?**
A: While the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of shingles, it doesn't provide 100% protection. A small percentage of vaccinated individuals may still develop shingles, but typically with milder symptoms.

**Q: How is the vaccine administered?**
A: It's administered as an intramuscular (IM) injection, usually in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.

**Q: How long does the vaccine protection last?**
A: The duration of protection is not fully determined, however, studies suggest it provides a good level of protection for several years.

**Q: Should I receive the vaccine if I've had chickenpox?**
A: Yes, the vaccine is recommended even if you've had chickenpox, as the virus can reactivate later in life, causing shingles.

**Q: Can I get the vaccine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**
A: It's recommended to discuss this with your doctor.  While it is not contraindicated, caution is advised and delaying vaccination may be recommended.


**Q: What should I do if I faint after receiving the vaccine?**
A:  Lie down until symptoms pass.  If the fainting is severe or prolonged, seek immediate medical attention.

**Q: How should I store the vaccine?**
A: Store the reconstituted vaccine refrigerated at 2-8°C (36-46°F).  Discard if frozen or if not used within 6 hours of reconstitution.  The unreconstituted vaccine should be stored as per the manufacturer's instructions.
