Zinc phenolsulfonate is primarily used in topical applications for its antimicrobial and astringent properties.  Historically, it found use in skincare products to combat microbial growth and reduce inflammation.

It's important to note that the use of zinc phenolsulfonate preparations is significantly less common now, and it has been discontinued in many regions.
