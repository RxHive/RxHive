# Zanubrutinib
### Generic Name
Zanubrutinib

### Usage
Zanubrutinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat certain types of blood cancers.  Its main applications are in adult patients with:

* **Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL):**  This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer affecting the lymphatic system. Zanubrutinib is used for adults with MCL who have already received at least one other treatment.
* **WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia (WM):** This is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow.  Zanubrutinib is an option for adult patients with this condition.
* **Relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL):**  This is another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  Zanubrutinib is used in adult patients whose MZL has returned (relapsed) or hasn't responded to previous treatment (refractory), specifically those who have received at least one prior treatment involving anti-CD20 therapy.


### Dosage

Dosage is determined by your doctor based on your specific condition and other health factors.  The usual dosage is:

* **Oral:**  The most common forms are capsules.  Dosage is typically 160 mg twice daily (BID) or 320 mg once daily (OD), depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  Treatment is typically continued until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dosage might need to be adjusted in specific situations:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild to moderate liver impairment, no dosage change is usually needed, but close monitoring is crucial.  For severe liver impairment, the dosage is reduced to 80 mg BID, with close monitoring for side effects.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments aren't specifically outlined for mild to moderate kidney impairment; however, close monitoring is essential for severe side effects.  For end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, similar monitoring is necessary.
* **Adverse Reactions:** The dose may be reduced, or treatment interrupted, if significant side effects occur.  Your doctor will guide you on the appropriate adjustments.
* **CYP3A Interactions:** Zanubrutinib's metabolism is influenced by CYP3A enzymes. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers may require dose adjustments or avoidance of concomitant use.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Zanubrutinib in children haven't been established.


### Side Effects

### How it Works

Zanubrutinib is a type of medication called a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.  BTK is a protein involved in the signaling pathways of B cells, a type of white blood cell.  In some blood cancers, these pathways are abnormally active, promoting cancer cell growth. Zanubrutinib works by binding to and blocking BTK, disrupting these signaling pathways and slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Zanubrutinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for two weeks after the last dose.
* **Bleeding Risk:** Zanubrutinib can increase the risk of bleeding.  Your doctor should be informed of any bleeding tendencies or if you are planning surgery.  Treatment might be temporarily interrupted before and after surgery.
* **Infections:** Zanubrutinib weakens the immune system, making you more susceptible to infections.  Report any signs of infection to your doctor immediately.  Prophylactic measures (preventative treatments) may be recommended for certain infections.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Zanubrutinib's metabolism can be affected by other medications, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A enzymes.  Inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Second Primary Malignancies:**  There's a potential increased risk of developing other cancers while taking Zanubrutinib.  Regular monitoring is important.
* **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Zanubrutinib may increase the risk of irregular heartbeats.
