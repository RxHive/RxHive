# Zinc Chloride

**Generic Name:** Zinc Chloride

**Usage:**

Zinc chloride has a wide range of uses, depending on its concentration and formulation.  These include:

* **Medicine:**  Topical application for treating skin conditions like warts, athlete's foot, and some types of acne.  It's also used as an astringent and antiseptic in mouthwashes and some throat lozenges.  It's a component in some antiperspirants.  *Note:  Direct ingestion of zinc chloride is dangerous and should never be attempted.*
* **Industry:**  Used as a wood preservative, a mordant in dyeing fabrics, a catalyst in chemical reactions, a dehydrating agent, and in the production of various other chemicals and materials (e.g., in the manufacture of rayon and zinc batteries).
* **Water Treatment:**  Used as a flocculant to clarify water by helping to precipitate impurities.


**Side Effects:**

The side effects of zinc chloride depend largely on the route of exposure and concentration:

* **Topical application:**  Mild irritation, redness, and burning sensation at the application site are possible.  More severe reactions are rare.
* **Ingestion:**  Ingestion of even small amounts of zinc chloride is extremely dangerous and can cause severe damage to the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.  Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and potentially fatal complications.
* **Inhalation:**  Inhalation of zinc chloride fumes can irritate the respiratory tract, causing coughing, shortness of breath, and potentially more severe lung damage.
* **Eye contact:**  Zinc chloride can cause severe eye irritation and burns.


**How it Works:**

Zinc chloride's mechanism of action varies depending on its application:

* **Antimicrobial:** It works as an antimicrobial agent by disrupting the cell membranes and proteins of bacteria and fungi, leading to their death or inhibited growth.  This accounts for its use in treating some skin infections.
* **Astringent:**  It causes proteins in tissues to coagulate, leading to a tightening and drying effect on the skin. This is why it's used as an astringent in mouthwashes and some antiperspirants.
* **Dehydrating agent:** In chemical processes, it acts by removing water molecules from other substances.
* **Catalyst:** In chemical reactions, it speeds up the rate of the reaction without being consumed itself.


**FAQs:**

* **Is zinc chloride safe?**  Topical application of dilute solutions is generally considered safe, but ingestion or inhalation is extremely dangerous.  Always follow instructions carefully.
* **Can zinc chloride be used internally?** No.  Zinc chloride should never be ingested.
* **What should I do if I accidentally ingest zinc chloride?** Immediately seek medical attention.  This is a medical emergency.
* **What should I do if zinc chloride gets in my eyes?** Immediately flush your eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention.
* **Is zinc chloride the same as zinc oxide?** No, they are different chemical compounds with different properties and uses. Zinc oxide is generally much safer for topical use.
