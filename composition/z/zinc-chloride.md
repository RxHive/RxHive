# Zinc Chloride
### Generic Name
Zinc Chloride

### Usage

Zinc chloride is primarily used in parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions to prevent or treat zinc deficiency.  This deficiency can arise in various situations, such as individuals receiving long-term intravenous nutrition, those with malabsorption syndromes, or those experiencing significant zinc losses (e.g., through prolonged diarrhea or fistulas).  While not a primary treatment, zinc plays a crucial role in numerous bodily functions, making its supplementation vital in cases of deficiency to support overall health and prevent complications.  


### Dosage

Dosage is expressed in terms of elemental zinc and varies considerably based on the patient's age, weight, and clinical condition.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing healthcare professional's specific instructions.

**Adults (Parenteral Nutrition):**

* **Maintenance Requirement:** The recommended daily intake of elemental zinc via IV varies.  Generally, 2.5-5 mg/day is considered appropriate for metabolically stable individuals receiving PN. Acute metabolic states may necessitate a higher dose (4.5-6 mg/day).  Higher doses (12.2 mg zinc/L TPN or 17.1 mg zinc/kg of stool or ileostomy output) might be needed when there are significant fluid losses from the small bowel.
* It's important to note that a clinical response to zinc supplementation might take 6-8 weeks.

**Pediatric (Parenteral Nutrition):** Dosage is highly individualized and depends on age and weight.  Always consult the prescribing information or a healthcare professional.  Here is general guidance:

* **Infants < 3 months:** 250 mcg/kg/day elemental zinc
* **Infants â‰¥ 3 months and Children:** 50 mcg/kg/day elemental zinc; Maximum dose: 5000 mcg/day.
* **Weight-Based Dosing:** Infants (<10 kg): 50-250 mcg/kg/day; Children (10-40 kg): 50-125 mcg/kg/day; Children and adolescents (>40kg): 2000-5000 mcg/day.

**Administration:** Zinc chloride is always administered intravenously as part of a total parenteral nutrition solution, never as a direct injection into a peripheral vein due to irritation and potential for phlebitis.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended in manufacturer labeling for hepatic or renal impairment, although caution is advised for patients with severe renal disease due to the potential for aluminum accumulation (some formulations contain aluminum).  A healthcare professional should always supervise dosing in these cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are rare but may include nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia (indigestion).

Less common but more serious side effects (reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):  hypotension, jaundice, leukopenia, neutropenia, pulmonary edema.

**Important:** Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Zinc chloride serves as a cofactor for over 100 enzymes involved in a wide range of biological processes.  It plays crucial roles in DNA synthesis, immune function, maintaining a sense of smell and taste, and insulin function.  By providing supplemental zinc, zinc chloride addresses deficiency and helps restore normal physiological function.


### Precautions

* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment, monitoring for aluminum accumulation (if the product contains aluminum).
* **Copper Levels:**  Administering zinc without copper supplementation may lead to decreased serum copper levels.
* **Drug Interactions:** Zinc chloride can interact with certain medications, such as dolutegravir and eltrombopag (reducing their efficacy).  Consult a healthcare professional regarding potential interactions with other drugs.
* **Aluminum Content:**  Be aware that some formulations may contain aluminum, which can be toxic with prolonged use, especially in patients with renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Zinc crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.  Use during pregnancy or lactation should be under strict medical supervision.  It is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take zinc chloride orally?** A: No.  Zinc chloride, in the context of this information, is intended for intravenous administration as part of parenteral nutrition and is not suitable for oral consumption.  Oral zinc supplements are available if needed.

* **Q: How should I store zinc chloride?** A:  Zinc chloride, as a component of PN solutions, should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions for the specific parenteral nutrition solution.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Do not attempt to "catch up" on missed doses. Contact your healthcare provider for guidance. Zinc is usually administered as part of an ongoing treatment plan.

* **Q:  Is zinc chloride safe for everyone?** A: While generally safe when administered correctly, as part of a PN regimen, under medical supervision, caution is required in individuals with renal impairment, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or those taking other medications.  Always discuss its use with your healthcare provider to ensure it's appropriate for your specific circumstances.
