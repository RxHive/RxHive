# Zanamivir
### Generic Name
Zanamivir

### Usage
Zanamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor used to treat uncomplicated acute illness caused by influenza A and B viruses.  It's effective in adults and children aged 7 years and older, but only if treatment begins within two days of symptom onset.  Zanamivir is also used to prevent influenza in adults and children aged 5 years and older, particularly in situations like household exposure or outbreaks in institutions or the community.  It's important to note that Zanamivir is *not* recommended for treating severe influenza cases requiring hospitalization.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Treatment of Influenza:** Two inhalations of 10 mg twice daily (BID) for five days.  The first day's doses should be at least two hours apart; subsequent doses should be approximately 12 hours apart.  Treatment may be extended for severely ill patients beyond 5 days.
* **Prophylaxis of Influenza:**  Dosage depends on the context:
    * **Household Exposure:** Two inhalations of 10 mg once daily (OD) for seven days after the last known exposure.
    * **Institutional Outbreak:** Two inhalations of 10 mg OD for at least two weeks, and until seven days after the last patient shows symptoms.
    * **Community Outbreak:** Two inhalations of 10 mg OD until community influenza activity subsides or immunity is achieved through vaccination. Treatment for up to 28 days has been deemed well-tolerated.

**Children:**

* **Treatment of Influenza (ages 7+):**  Same as adults: Two inhalations of 10 mg BID for five days, with appropriate spacing between doses. Treatment should begin within two days of symptom onset.
* **Prophylaxis of Influenza (ages 5+):** Two inhalations (10 mg) OD.  Duration varies based on exposure type, vaccination status, immunosuppression, and risk of severe complications.  Generally, it's seven days after last exposure for household/non-outbreak scenarios and at least two weeks (plus one week after the last identified case) for institutional outbreaks.

**Important Note:** Zanamivir is administered via inhalation using a Diskhaler device.  Do not attempt to manipulate, solubilize, or nebulize the powder.  Patients using inhaled bronchodilators should use them *before* Zanamivir.

Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.  Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Zanamivir inhibits the neuraminidase enzymes of the influenza virus.  These enzymes are crucial for the virus to release from infected cells and spread throughout the body. By blocking neuraminidase, Zanamivir prevents the virus from replicating and spreading, thereby reducing the severity and duration of the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindicated in:** Patients with hypersensitivity to Zanamivir or any component of the formulation (including milk protein).
* **Use with caution in:** Pregnant women (not the preferred treatment for influenza), breastfeeding women, and individuals with renal impairment (although dosage adjustment isn't usually necessary, potential accumulation should be considered).
* **Drug Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with live attenuated influenza vaccines.
* **Increased risk:**  Zanamivir may increase the risk of allergic reactions, neuropsychiatric events, and bronchospasm.
* **General Considerations:**  Always use the Diskhaler device as directed.  Avoid alcohol during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Zanamivir if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Use with caution during breastfeeding; it's not the preferred treatment during pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus and mother.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store Zanamivir?** A: Store as directed on the packaging, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I use Zanamivir to treat a cold?** A: No, Zanamivir is only effective against influenza (flu) viruses, not the common cold or other respiratory illnesses.

* **Q:  Is Zanamivir always effective?** A:  The effectiveness of Zanamivir can vary depending on several factors, including the specific strain of influenza, the timing of treatment, and individual patient factors.  Consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action.
