# Zinc Citrate
### Generic Name
Zinc Citrate

### Usage
Zinc citrate is a dietary supplement providing zinc, an essential mineral crucial for numerous bodily functions.  Its primary use is to treat or prevent zinc deficiency.  Zinc deficiency can manifest in various ways, including impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, loss of appetite, and skin problems.  While not a primary treatment, zinc citrate is sometimes used as a supplemental therapy to support the immune system during common colds, although evidence of significant benefit is limited.  It's also found in some dental products due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

### Dosage
Dosage of zinc citrate varies significantly depending on the individual's needs, age, and the reason for supplementation.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's recommendations.  There's no universally recommended dosage.  Generally, dosages for adults range from 15-50 mg of elemental zinc per day, but this can be higher in cases of severe deficiency under medical supervision.  Children's dosages should always be determined by a pediatrician. Different formulations (tablets, capsules, liquids) will contain varying amounts of elemental zinc, so it is essential to check the label for the amount of zinc per dose.  Oral administration is typical.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of zinc citrate supplementation, particularly at higher doses, may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach cramps
* Headache
* Loss of appetite

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

*  Copper deficiency (long-term high doses)
*  Reduced immune function (paradoxically, at very high doses)
*  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Zinc citrate works by providing the body with elemental zinc.  Zinc is a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in various metabolic processes. It plays a vital role in:

* **Immune function:** Zinc supports the development and function of immune cells, helping the body fight off infections.
* **Cell growth and repair:** Zinc is essential for cell division and wound healing.
* **Protein synthesis:** Zinc is involved in the creation of proteins, vital for building and repairing tissues.
* **DNA synthesis:**  Zinc plays a role in the replication of genetic material.

By supplementing with zinc citrate, individuals can address zinc deficiency and support these crucial bodily processes.

### Precautions
* **Interactions:** Zinc can interact with certain medications, including antibiotics (tetracycline) and diuretics. Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.
* **Contraindications:** Individuals with known zinc allergies should avoid zinc citrate.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using zinc citrate during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as safe dosages haven't been definitively established.
* **Pre-existing conditions:** Those with pre-existing medical conditions should consult their doctor before using zinc citrate supplements.
* **High doses:**  Taking excessive amounts of zinc can be harmful and potentially lead to the aforementioned side effects. Always stick to recommended doses.
