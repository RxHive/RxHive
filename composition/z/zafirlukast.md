# Zafirlukast
### Generic Name
Zafirlukast

### Usage
Zafirlukast is primarily used for the long-term prevention and treatment of asthma in patients aged 5 years and older.  It's a leukotriene receptor antagonist, meaning it works by blocking the effects of leukotrienes, substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This action helps reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. While not its primary indication, zafirlukast has also been used off-label in the treatment of chronic urticaria (hives).  It's important to note that this off-label use should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults (12 years and older):** The usual dose for asthma is 20 mg twice daily (BID). For off-label use in chronic urticaria, the same dosage is typically employed.

**Children (5-11 years):** The recommended dose for asthma is 10 mg twice daily (BID).

**Dosage Forms:** Zafirlukast is usually available as oral tablets.

**Administration:**  It's best to take zafirlukast at least one hour before or two hours after a meal to maximize absorption.  Do not crush or chew the tablets.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.  However, zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment (liver disease).

### How it Works

Zafirlukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist.  Leukotrienes are inflammatory substances that contribute to asthma symptoms by causing airway constriction and inflammation.  Zafirlukast works by blocking the binding of leukotrienes to their receptors in the airways. By preventing leukotrienes from exerting their effects, zafirlukast helps reduce inflammation and bronchoconstriction, leading to improved lung function and fewer asthma symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to zafirlukast or any of its components, and in those with hepatic impairment (including cirrhosis).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use of zafirlukast with warfarin (an anticoagulant) may increase the risk of bleeding.  Interactions have also been reported with theophylline, terfenadine, erythromycin, fluconazole, and high-dose aspirin, potentially altering plasma levels of these medications.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your healthcare provider.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Zafirlukast is categorized as pregnancy category B. However, alternative treatments are generally preferred during pregnancy.  The excretion of zafirlukast in breast milk is unknown, and breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for adverse reactions in the infant.
* **Other Precautions:**  Increased risk of eosinophilia (increased eosinophils), vasculitis, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), infections, and neuropsychiatric events have been reported. Regular monitoring may be necessary.  Zafirlukast is not intended for the acute treatment of asthma attacks.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take zafirlukast with other asthma medications?**  A:  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor to assess for potential interactions.  Zafirlukast is often used in conjunction with other asthma treatments, such as inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators.

**Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full therapeutic effect of zafirlukast may not be seen immediately.  It generally takes several days or weeks of regular use for significant improvement in asthma control.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Follow your doctor's instructions.

**Q: How should I store zafirlukast?** A: Store zafirlukast tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Can I stop taking zafirlukast abruptly?** A:  No, do not stop taking zafirlukast suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may worsen your asthma symptoms.  Your doctor will advise you on the appropriate way to discontinue the medication.
