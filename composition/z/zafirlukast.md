# Zafirlukast

**Generic Name:** Zafirlukast

**Usage:**

Zafirlukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) used to prevent asthma symptoms and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in adults and children 5 years of age and older.  It's also used to prevent symptoms of chronic allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children 12 years of age and older.  It is a *preventative* medication, meaning it's taken regularly, even when symptoms aren't present, to help control them. It is *not* for immediate relief of asthma symptoms; a rescue inhaler (like albuterol) is needed for that.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Abdominal pain
* Fatigue
* Muscle aches
* Increased liver enzymes (seen in blood tests)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

Serious but rare side effects include:

* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Churg-Strauss syndrome (a rare blood vessel disorder)


**How it Works:**

Zafirlukast works by blocking the action of leukotrienes, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and tightening of the airways in the lungs. By blocking these leukotrienes, zafirlukast helps reduce inflammation and improve airflow, thus preventing asthma and allergy symptoms.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take zafirlukast with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.  Some interactions are more likely with certain medications like certain blood thinners or antifungal medications.

* **How long does it take to work?**  Zafirlukast usually takes a few weeks to reach its full effect.  You should continue to take it regularly even if you don't notice an immediate improvement.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.

* **Can I stop taking zafirlukast suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking zafirlukast suddenly.  Stopping abruptly may worsen your symptoms.  Talk to your doctor before stopping treatment.

* **Are there any specific dietary restrictions?**  There are no specific dietary restrictions associated with taking zafirlukast.

* **What are the symptoms of a serious side effect?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as severe stomach pain, jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), easy bruising or bleeding, or unusual fatigue.
