# Zolmitriptan

**Generic Name:** Zolmitriptan

**Usage:** Zolmitriptan is a triptan medication used to treat migraine headaches with or without aura in adults.  It's taken at the first sign of a migraine to abort the headache or reduce its severity.  It is *not* for the preventative treatment of migraines.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Weakness
* Warmth or flushing sensation
* Tingling or numbness
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Constipation

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Chest pain or tightness (seek immediate medical attention if this occurs)
* High blood pressure
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Seizures


**How it Works:** Zolmitriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT1B/1D).  It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain and reducing the release of substances that can cause pain and inflammation associated with migraine headaches.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but this action helps to relieve the symptoms of a migraine.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: Zolmitriptan typically starts working within 30 minutes to 2 hours.  However, the response time can vary between individuals.

* **Q: How often can I take it?** A:  Do not take more than 2 doses of zolmitriptan within 24 hours. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Overuse can lead to medication overuse headaches.

* **Q: Can I take it with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, that you are taking. Zolmitriptan may interact with certain medications, such as MAO inhibitors, ergotamines, or other triptans.

* **Q: Who shouldn't take zolmitriptan?** A: Zolmitriptan should not be taken by people with certain medical conditions, including severe heart, liver, or kidney disease; uncontrolled high blood pressure; history of stroke or heart attack; or those with a history of allergic reaction to triptans.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking zolmitriptan.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Since zolmitriptan is used for acute migraine treatment, missing a dose is usually not a concern.  Only take a dose if you are experiencing a migraine headache. Never double the dose.
