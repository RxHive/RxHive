# Zolmitriptan
### Generic Name
Zolmitriptan

### Usage
Zolmitriptan is a triptan medication primarily used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches, both with and without aura, in adults.  It's crucial to remember that Zolmitriptan is only for treating migraine attacks *after* a diagnosis of migraine has been confirmed by a healthcare professional. It's not intended for preventing migraines or treating other types of headaches like cluster headaches.  While sometimes used off-label for menstrual migraine prophylaxis and cluster headaches, these uses aren't supported by extensive clinical trials.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the formulation (oral tablet, orally disintegrating tablet, nasal spray).

* **Oral Tablet/Orally Disintegrating Tablet:** The typical starting dose is 2.5 mg, with a maximum single dose of 5 mg.  A second dose can be taken after two hours if needed, but the total daily dose shouldn't exceed 10 mg. The 1.25 mg tablet can be used to start at a lower dose if needed.  Orally disintegrating tablets dissolve on the tongue and don't require water.  The safety of using Zolmitriptan for more than three migraines per month hasn't been fully established.

* **Nasal Spray:** The recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg.  A maximum single dose of 5mg is allowed. A second dose can be taken after two hours if necessary, but the total daily dose should not exceed 10mg.  The safety of using the nasal spray for more than four headaches in a 30-day period hasn't been established.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of oral Zolmitriptan haven't been established for children under 18 years old. The nasal spray may be used in children 12 years and older at the adult dosage, but always under strict medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.  Individuals with mild hepatic impairment may not require dosage adjustments for oral formulations; however, those with moderate to severe impairment may need a lower initial dose (e.g., 1.25 mg for oral tablets, with a maximum daily dose of 5 mg for severe impairment).  Nasal spray is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  For renal impairment, while no specific adjustment is listed, it's important to note that Zolmitriptan clearance is reduced in patients with severe renal impairment, warranting careful monitoring.

If Zolmitriptan is taken with cimetidine, the maximum single dose should be limited to 2.5 mg, with a maximum daily dose of 5 mg.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients):**

* **Oral formulations:** Unpleasant taste, dizziness, drowsiness, paresthesia (pins and needles), nausea.
* **Nasal spray:**  Unpleasant taste, dizziness, drowsiness, chills, headache, nasal irritation, and sensations of pressure or flushing in the face.


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Chest pain, palpitations, changes in blood pressure, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), serotonin syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening condition).

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Zolmitriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist (a type of triptan). It works by binding to specific serotonin receptors (5-HT1B and 5-HT1D) in blood vessels in the brain and on the trigeminal nerve (a nerve involved in migraine pain). This action causes narrowing of blood vessels in the brain (vasoconstriction) and reduces the release of inflammatory substances, thus relieving migraine pain.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with a history of coronary artery disease (including angina, myocardial infarction, or silent ischemia), uncontrolled hypertension, certain heart rhythm disorders, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic bowel disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack, hemiplegic or basilar migraine, or those who have recently used MAO inhibitors or other triptans or ergot medications.  Also contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity to zolmitriptan or any component of the formulation and those with ophthalmoplegic migraine.

* **Interactions:**  Zolmitriptan can interact with other medications, particularly MAO inhibitors, other triptans, ergot derivatives, and certain antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs), potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects, including serotonin syndrome.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting Zolmitriptan.

* **Warnings:**  Patients with risk factors for heart disease should be carefully evaluated before taking Zolmitriptan.  Use with caution in elderly patients and those with hepatic or renal impairment. Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with the prescribing physician.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive after taking Zolmitriptan?** A:  Zolmitriptan can cause dizziness and drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Q: How should I store Zolmitriptan?** A: Store Zolmitriptan as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Zolmitriptan is used for acute migraine treatment; it's not taken regularly.  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible if still experiencing a migraine attack, following the prescribed dosage instructions, unless otherwise directed by a physician.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of action can vary, but many experience relief within a couple of hours.

* **Q: Is Zolmitriptan addictive?** A:  Zolmitriptan is not considered an addictive medication. However, overuse can lead to medication-overuse headache.

* **Q: Can I take Zolmitriptan with other migraine medications?** A:  Discuss with your doctor.  Combining Zolmitriptan with other medications requires careful consideration due to potential interactions.  Never combine Zolmitriptan with other triptans or ergot medications without your doctor's consent.
