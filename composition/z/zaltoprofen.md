### How it Works

Zaltoprofen belongs to the propionic acid-derived NSAIDs. It works by selectively inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain.  By reducing prostaglandin levels, zaltoprofen decreases inflammation and pain signals. It also inhibits the function of B2-type bradykinin receptors in nerve endings, further contributing to its pain-relieving effects.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Allergy to zaltoprofen or any NSAID (including aspirin).
*   History of asthma, hives, or allergic-type reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs.
*   Active peptic ulcer.
*   Severe hematologic disorders.
*   Severe hepatic impairment.
*   Severe renal impairment.
*   Severe heart failure.
*   Use before or after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
*   Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis).
*   Breastfeeding.
*   Third trimester of pregnancy.

**Warnings:**

Zaltoprofen increases the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events (heart attack, stroke), serious gastrointestinal events (ulceration, bleeding, perforation), and hepatic effects.  It should be used cautiously in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, heart problems, or edema (swelling).  Long-term use may cause temporary infertility in women.  It should be used cautiously in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.

**Drug Interactions:**  Zaltoprofen can interact with many other medications, including but not limited to anticoagulants, other NSAIDs, and certain diuretics. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential interactions.
