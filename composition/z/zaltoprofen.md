# Zaltoprofen

There is no drug currently approved with the generic name "Zaltoprofen".  It's possible this is a misspelling, a drug in development, or a name not used in standard pharmaceutical nomenclature.  If you can provide more information, such as the brand name or intended use, I can try to assist you further.  I can provide information on other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) if you'd like, as Zaltoprofen might be intended as a similar medication.
