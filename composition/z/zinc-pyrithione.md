# Zinc Pyrithione
### Generic Name
Zinc Pyrithione

### Usage
Zinc pyrithione is primarily used topically to treat the itching, irritation, and flaking associated with dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and other skin conditions characterized by excessive skin cell buildup (hyperkeratosis).  It's effective because it inhibits the growth of the fungus *Malassezia globosa*, often implicated in these conditions. While not its primary indication, some formulations may be used for other fungal skin infections.  Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation (shampoo, cream, lotion, bar soap, body wash) and the condition being treated.  There's no standardized dosage across all products.  Instructions for use are always provided on the product label and should be followed carefully.

* **Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis:** For shampoos, typically, application at least twice weekly is recommended.  For creams, lotions, or body washes, application frequency may range from once to three times daily, as directed on the product label.
* **Hyperkeratotic Skin Conditions:**  The frequency of application will vary depending on the product and the severity of the condition. Refer to the product label for specific directions.
* **Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of zinc pyrithione in children haven't been fully established.  Consult a pediatrician before using it on children.

**Administration:**  Application methods vary depending on the product form: shampoos are applied to wet hair and massaged into the scalp; creams and lotions are applied directly to affected areas; body washes are lathered and rinsed; and cleansing bars are used like regular soap. Always avoid contact with the eyes.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Stinging or burning sensation at the application site.
* Skin irritation or dryness.
* Skin peeling or redness.

Rare but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or worsening symptoms, discontinue use and contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Zinc pyrithione works by inhibiting the growth of *Malassezia globosa*, a fungus that contributes to dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.  It achieves this by interfering with the fungus's ability to utilize copper, an essential nutrient.  Zinc pyrithione acts as a copper ionophore, shuttling copper into the fungal cells where it disrupts vital cellular processes, leading to reduced fungal growth and alleviating the symptoms associated with the infection.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Avoid using zinc pyrithione if you have a known allergy to it or any of its components.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of zinc pyrithione during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Eye Contact:** Avoid contact with eyes. Rinse thoroughly with water if contact occurs.
* **Other Medications:**  There's limited information regarding interactions with other medications.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Topical Use Only:**  Do not ingest zinc pyrithione. It is for external use only.
