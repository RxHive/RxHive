# Zinc Acetate
### Generic Name
Zinc Acetate

### Usage
Zinc acetate is primarily used in the maintenance treatment of Wilson's disease.  This is a rare inherited disorder where the body doesn't metabolize copper properly, leading to a buildup of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs.  Zinc acetate works by reducing the absorption of copper from the intestines, thereby helping to lower copper levels in the body. It's crucial to understand that zinc acetate is *not* typically used as the initial treatment for Wilson's disease; it's employed after initial chelation therapy to help maintain lower copper levels and prevent the disease's progression.

### Dosage

**Wilson's Disease:** Dosage is expressed in milligrams (mg) of elemental zinc.  The specific dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual patient needs and response to treatment.  

* **Adults:**  The usual starting dose is 50 mg three times daily (TID).  In some cases, a lower dose of 25 mg TID might be used initially, but the dose should be increased to 50 mg TID if the lower dose proves inadequate.  For pregnant women, the initial dose is typically 25 mg TID, with a possible increase to 50 mg TID if needed.

* **Children (aged 5 years and older):** For children aged 5 to 10 years, the usual dose is 25 mg TID.  For children aged 10 years and older (adolescents), the dose is also typically 25 mg TID.  In both age groups, the dose may be increased to 50 mg TID if the lower dose is insufficient.

**Important Note:**  The administration of zinc acetate should always be under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.  They will monitor the patient’s response to treatment and adjust the dosage accordingly.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Gastric irritation (such as upset stomach)
* Increased levels of serum amylase (an enzyme in the pancreas) and serum lipase (an enzyme that helps digest fats).
* Increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a liver enzyme.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Neurological deterioration (worsening of neurological symptoms)
* Hepatic insufficiency (liver failure)

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Zinc acetate works by increasing the production of metallothionein, a protein that binds to copper. This binding prevents copper from being absorbed in the intestines and reabsorbed from other sites, such as saliva and bile.  The bound copper is then eliminated from the body in the feces, helping to lower the overall copper levels in the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Zinc acetate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to zinc acetate or any components of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Zinc acetate can interact with several medications, including some antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), antiviral medications,  and others. It's vital to inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking to prevent potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Zinc acetate is considered Category A in pregnancy. However, because zinc is excreted in breast milk, breastfeeding may not be recommended while using this medication.  Your doctor will advise you on this.

* **Other Precautions:**  Gastrointestinal side effects are more common if the medication is taken in the morning. Taking the dose after breakfast may alleviate this.  Always take zinc acetate as directed by your physician.  Do not crush or chew the capsules; swallow them whole.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take zinc acetate with food?**  A: No, it's generally recommended to take zinc acetate on an empty stomach, at least an hour before or 2-3 hours after meals to maximize absorption.

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A: The effectiveness of zinc acetate will vary from person to person and is monitored through regular checks of copper levels.  It’s a long-term maintenance treatment, not a quick fix.

* **Q: How should I store zinc acetate?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on what to do if you miss a dose.  Don't try to double up on doses.
