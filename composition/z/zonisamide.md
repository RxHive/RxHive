# Zonisamide
### Generic Name
Zonisamide

### Usage
Zonisamide is primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in managing partial seizures in adults with epilepsy.  This means it's used *in addition* to other anti-seizure medications, not as a standalone treatment. While not its primary indication, it's also sometimes used off-label for weight loss, though this use requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional due to potential side effects.  It's crucial to understand that Zonisamide's use for weight loss is not FDA-approved and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Partial Seizures):**

* **Initial Dose:** 100 mg once daily (OD).
* **Dosage Increase:** After two weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg/day for at least two more weeks.  Further increases to 300 mg/day and then 400 mg/day may be considered, each maintained for at least two weeks to allow for steady-state levels to be reached.
* **Maintenance Dose:** 100-600 mg/day, divided into one or two doses.
* **Maximum Dose:** 600 mg/day.  Doses above 400 mg/day haven't shown additional benefit.

**Adult Dosage (Off-Label Weight Loss):**

* **Initial Dose:** 100 mg OD.
* **Dosage Increase:** Increase by 100 mg/day every two weeks, as tolerated.
* **Maintenance Dose:** 100-600 mg/day, divided into one or two doses.
* **Maximum Dose:** 600 mg/day, but only in patients who haven't lost 5% of their initial weight.  This use requires close monitoring.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of Zonisamide in children under 16 haven't been established.  For those aged 16 and older, dosage guidelines for partial seizures are similar to adults, starting at 100 mg/day and increasing gradually as needed and tolerated.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment. However, slower titration (gradual increase) and frequent monitoring are crucial. Use with caution.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 50 mL/min or higher, dosage adjustments aren't specified, but cautious titration and monitoring are recommended.  Use is generally *not* recommended for patients with a GFR below 50 mL/min.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**

* Headache
* Agitation
* Irritability
* Fatigue
* Confusion
* Depression
* Insomnia
* Memory impairment
* Speech disturbances
* Ataxia (lack of muscle coordination)
* Metabolic acidosis
* Skin rash
* Kidney stones
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior

This is not an exhaustive list.  Many other side effects are possible, ranging from mild to severe.  Consult a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Zonisamide's exact mechanism isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to work by blocking sodium channels in neurons and reducing certain calcium currents, thereby stabilizing neuronal membranes and suppressing the excessive neuronal activity that causes seizures. It also has some carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity.  It does not appear to enhance the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits neuronal activity.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Zonisamide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to zonisamide, sulfonamides, or any formulation components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine can reduce zonisamide plasma concentrations.  Combining it with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors increases the risk of metabolic acidosis.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Zonisamide is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  Effective contraception should be used by women of childbearing potential. It's excreted in breast milk, so careful consideration is needed when breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and monitor for signs of metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, and suicidal ideation.  Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants, maintain adequate hydration, and avoid activities requiring alertness.  Older adults and children might be at increased risk for certain side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Zonisamide with other medications?** A:  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before taking Zonisamide.  Some medications can interact negatively.

* **Q: How should I store Zonisamide?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Zonisamide suddenly?** A: No.  Abruptly stopping Zonisamide can lead to withdrawal symptoms or worsen seizures.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.

* **Q:  Can Zonisamide cause weight loss?** A: While itâ€™s sometimes used off-label for weight loss, this is not an FDA-approved use. Weight loss can be a side effect, but it can also have serious and potentially dangerous side effects.  Only use it under strict medical supervision for this purpose.
