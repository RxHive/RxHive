# Zileuton
### Generic Name
Zileuton

### Usage
Zileuton is primarily used for the long-term prevention and control of asthma symptoms in adults and children 12 years of age and older.  It's a leukotriene inhibitor, meaning it works by blocking the production of leukotrienes, substances that contribute to inflammation and narrowing of the airways in asthma.  Importantly, Zileuton is not a rescue medication for acute asthma attacks; it's designed for daily use to help prevent attacks.  While it's primarily used for asthma, its specific role in asthma management has diminished in recent years due to the availability of more effective and widely-used treatments.


### Dosage

**Adults (12 years and older):**

* **Immediate-release tablets:** The typical dose is 600 mg four times daily (QID).
* **Extended-release tablets:** The typical dose is 1200 mg twice daily (BID).

The maximum daily dose for both immediate-release and extended-release formulations is 2400 mg.

**Children (12 years and older):**  The dosage for children 12 years and older is the same as for adults.  Zileuton is not typically recommended for children under 12 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with kidney problems. However, Zileuton is completely contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or persistently elevated liver enzymes (more than three times the upper limit of normal).  This is because liver damage is a known potential side effect.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Chest pain
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash
* Itching
* Increased liver enzymes (this is a serious side effect, and monitoring is crucial)

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Liver damage (hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic failure)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Mood changes, including suicidal thoughts.
* Behavioral changes


If any of these side effects occur, particularly those related to liver function or mental health, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Zileuton works by inhibiting the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. This enzyme plays a key role in the production of leukotrienes, inflammatory chemicals that trigger the symptoms of asthma, such as bronchospasm (constriction of the airways), inflammation, and mucus production. By blocking the production of leukotrienes, zileuton helps to reduce airway inflammation and improve airflow.


### Precautions

* **Liver Disease:** Zileuton is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or elevated liver enzymes. Regular liver function tests are essential during treatment.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Anyone with a history of allergic reactions to Zileuton or similar medications should not take it.  Signs of a serious allergic reaction require immediate medical attention.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Zileuton is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning potential risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  It's essential to discuss the risks and benefits with a doctor before taking it during pregnancy. The excretion of Zileuton in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Zileuton may interact with certain other medications. It's important to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking Zileuton, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Zileuton with other asthma medications?** A: Zileuton may be used in conjunction with other asthma controllers, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment regimen.  It is *not* a rescue inhaler for acute asthma attacks.

* **Q: How should I store Zileuton?** A: Store Zileuton at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: Is Zileuton habit-forming?** A: No, Zileuton is not a controlled substance and is not habit-forming.

* **Q: When should I contact my doctor?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions, liver problems, or significant changes in your mood or behavior.  Regular monitoring of your liver function is crucial while on this medication.  Regular monitoring of your asthma symptoms is also vital.
