# Zileuton

**Generic Name:** Zileuton

**Usage:** Zileuton is a leukotriene inhibitor used to prevent and treat asthma in adults and children 12 years of age and older. It's not used for relieving acute asthma attacks.  It's often prescribed for patients whose asthma isn't adequately controlled with other medications.  It can also be used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, zileuton can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:**  A frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:** Can be mild to moderate.
* **Diarrhea:**  Often mild and self-limiting.
* **Abdominal pain:**  May be associated with nausea and diarrhea.
* **Increased liver enzymes:** This is a more serious side effect that requires monitoring of liver function.  Zileuton can cause liver damage, although this is rare.  Regular liver function tests are usually recommended during treatment.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Dizziness:**  Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Muscle pain:**  Myalgia.
* **Cholestasis:**  A rare but serious side effect involving blockage of bile flow in the liver.  Symptoms may include jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools.


**How it Works:** Zileuton works by blocking the action of leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are substances in the body that cause inflammation and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways) in the lungs, leading to asthma symptoms. By inhibiting leukotrienes, zileuton helps to reduce inflammation and improve airflow in the lungs.
