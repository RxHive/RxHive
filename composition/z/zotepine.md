# Zotepine
### Generic Name
Zotepine

### Usage
Zotepine is primarily used to treat acute and chronic schizophrenia.  This means it's helpful for managing both the initial, intense symptoms of schizophrenia and the ongoing symptoms that may persist over time.  While not its primary indication, Zotepine may also be considered for other conditions under the guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

**Adults (Schizophrenia):** Zotepine is typically administered orally.  The initial dose is usually 25 mg three times a day (TID).  The doctor will gradually increase the dose, if needed, at intervals of at least four days.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg TID.  For older adults, the starting dose is lower (25 mg TID), with a maximum daily dose of 75 mg TID due to increased sensitivity.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Zotepine haven't been established in children under 18 years old. It should not be used in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The dose should be reduced in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction, and liver function should be closely monitored.  Use caution.
* **Renal Impairment:** The starting dose should be reduced to 25 mg twice a day (BID).

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Asthenia (weakness or fatigue)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Abnormal liver function test (LFT) results
* Increased prolactin levels
* Weight gain
* Constipation
* Agitation
* Anxiety
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Somnolence (sleepiness)

Less common but serious side effects can occur.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.**

### How it Works

Zotepine is an atypical antipsychotic.  It works by affecting multiple neurotransmitters in the brain. It blocks dopamine receptors (D1 and D2), which are involved in regulating thoughts, emotions, and movement.  It also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine, and interacts with serotonin, adrenergic, and histamine receptors.  By influencing these neurotransmitters, Zotepine helps to reduce the symptoms associated with schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Zotepine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Pre-existing QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm)
* Renal stones (kidney stones)
* Acute gouty attacks
* Paralytic ileus (intestinal blockage)
* CNS depression (reduced brain activity)
* Coronary artery disease (CAD) with or without angina pectoris
* Pheochromocytoma (adrenal gland tumor)
* Prostate hyperplasia (enlarged prostate)
* Neuroblastoma (cancer)
* Parkinson's disease
* Closed-angle glaucoma


**Use with Caution:** Zotepine should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Severe liver dysfunction
* Kidney insufficiency
* Pre-existing heart disease
* Prolactin-dependent tumors
* Menstrual irregularities or hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels)
* Severe hypotension or hypertension
* Organic brain disease
* History of seizures
* Parkinson's disease or other brainstem disorders
* Chronic respiratory disorders or asthma
* Prostatic hypertrophy with urinary retention
* Narrow-angle glaucoma
* Gastrointestinal tract stenosis (narrowing)
* Orthostatic disorders (dizziness upon standing)


**Drug Interactions:** Zotepine can interact with other medications, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Particular caution is needed when co-administering with drugs that prolong the QT interval, cause hypokalemia, or are CNS depressants.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Zotepine is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking. Use caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is excreted in breast milk.
