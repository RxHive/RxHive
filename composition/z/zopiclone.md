# Zopiclone
### Generic Name
Zopiclone

### Usage
Zopiclone is primarily used for the short-term treatment of insomnia.  This means it's designed to help people who are having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early.  It provides symptomatic relief, meaning it addresses the symptoms of insomnia rather than the underlying cause.  Zopiclone is generally only recommended for use for 7-10 days and treatment shouldn't exceed 4 weeks, including the withdrawal period.  Longer-term use should only be considered after careful evaluation by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual starting dose is 3.75 mg taken orally at bedtime.  This may be increased to 5 mg, and then to a maximum of 7.5 mg per day, if needed, based on individual response and doctor's recommendation. However, the maximum daily dose is 7.5mg.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for certain groups:

* **Elderly or debilitated patients:**  The starting dose is typically lower (3.75 mg), with a maximum of 5 mg daily.
* **Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency:** Start with 3.75 mg and increase cautiously, if necessary, but it is contraindicated in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency.
* **Patients with hepatic impairment:**  Mild to moderate impairment may require a lower starting dose and careful monitoring. Severe hepatic impairment contraindicates the use of Zopiclone.
* **Patients with renal impairment:** A lower starting dose may be appropriate, and close monitoring is advised.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Zopiclone in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Daytime drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Bitter taste
* Confusion
* Memory impairment

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Paradoxical reactions (agitation, anxiety, aggression)
* Hallucinations
* Respiratory depression
* Allergic reactions (such as angioedema)
* Sleep-related complex behaviors (sleepwalking, sleep-driving, sleep-eating - these often occur without recall).  

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Zopiclone is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic.  It works by binding to specific receptors in the brain that are involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness.  This binding enhances the effects of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a neurotransmitter that has calming and sleep-promoting effects. By increasing GABA activity, Zopiclone helps to reduce sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep), increases total sleep time, and decreases the number of nighttime awakenings.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Zopiclone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, severe hepatic insufficiency, severe respiratory impairment (such as significant sleep apnea), myasthenia gravis, and patients with a history of complex sleep behaviors after taking any non-benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Zopiclone can interact with other medications, particularly other central nervous system depressants (alcohol, opioids, antidepressants, antihistamines), affecting their efficacy or increasing the risk of side effects.  It may also interact with certain enzyme inducers and inhibitors (such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, and some antifungals) affecting zopiclone levels. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Zopiclone is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning that it poses a potential risk to the fetus. Use during pregnancy is generally not recommended. Zopiclone is excreted in breast milk, therefore breastfeeding is also not recommended during its use.
* **Elderly and Debilitated Patients:** These patients are more susceptible to side effects, and lower doses are typically recommended.
* **Patients with respiratory or hepatic conditions:** Use should be approached cautiously, and may be contraindicated depending on severity.
* **Potential for dependence:** Long-term use can lead to physical and psychological dependence.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment.  Abrupt cessation after prolonged use can cause withdrawal symptoms, so gradual tapering under medical supervision is essential.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Zopiclone to work?** A:  The onset of sleep-inducing effects typically occurs within 30-60 minutes of taking the medication.

* **Q: Can I take Zopiclone with alcohol?** A: No. Combining Zopiclone with alcohol significantly increases the risk of central nervous system depression, including respiratory depression.  This combination is highly dangerous.

* **Q: Can I drive after taking Zopiclone?** A: No.  Zopiclone can cause drowsiness and impair judgment and coordination, making it unsafe to operate machinery or vehicles.

* **Q: How should I store Zopiclone?** A: Store Zopiclone in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and out of the reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  If it's nearly time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Contact your doctor if you have concerns.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.  Some side effects can be serious and require medical attention.
