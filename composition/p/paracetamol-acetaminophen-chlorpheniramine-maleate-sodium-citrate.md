# Paracetamol/Acetaminophen + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol/Acetaminophen + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Citrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and allergies.  The specific symptoms it targets are:

* **Fever:** Paracetamol/Acetaminophen reduces fever.
* **Pain:** Paracetamol/Acetaminophen reduces mild to moderate pain.
* **Runny Nose/Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an antihistamine that helps dry up nasal secretions and reduce sneezing.
* **Cough (in some formulations):** Some formulations may include a cough suppressant in addition to these three ingredients.  This information is not included as the question specifies only Paracetamol/Acetaminophen + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Sodium Citrate.
* **Congestion (Sodium Citrate's Role):** Sodium citrate acts as an expectorant, helping to thin mucus and make it easier to cough up. This assists in relieving congestion, although it does not directly address nasal congestion like Chlorpheniramine.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Drowsiness:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate is a sedating antihistamine and can cause drowsiness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
* **Dry Mouth:** A common side effect of both antihistamines and some pain relievers.
* **Constipation:**  A possible side effect.
* **Nausea:** Although uncommon, nausea is a potential side effect.
* **Upset Stomach:** This can occur, especially with higher doses.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.
* **Liver Damage (Paracetamol/Acetaminophen):**  Taking excessive doses of paracetamol can cause liver damage.  Always follow the recommended dosage instructions.

**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol/Acetaminophen:** Reduces fever by acting on the area of the brain that regulates body temperature. It also reduces pain by interfering with the body's production of prostaglandins, chemicals that sensitize nerve endings to pain.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Sodium Citrate:**  Increases the fluid content of mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expectorate.
