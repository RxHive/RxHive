# Physostigmine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Physostigmine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Physostigmine ophthalmic solution or ointment is primarily used to treat glaucoma.  It's a medication that lowers intraocular pressure (the pressure inside the eye), a key factor in managing glaucoma.  While its primary use is in glaucoma, it's specifically used for open-angle glaucoma and certain other types of glaucoma where lowering intraocular pressure is crucial for preventing vision loss.  It's not typically used for other eye conditions.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (solution or ointment) and the severity of the glaucoma.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  Generally:

* **Adults and Children (including adolescents):**  For glaucoma, the typical dosage is:
    * **Ointment (0.25%):** Apply a 1-cm strip of ointment to the lower eyelid of the affected eye(s) up to three times daily.
    * **Solution (0.25% or 0.5%):** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) up to four times daily.

The frequency and duration of treatment will be determined by your ophthalmologist based on your individual needs and response to treatment.  

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Lacrimation (increased tearing)
* Marked miosis (excessive constriction of the pupils)
* Blurred vision
* Eye pain
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) can include:

* Headache
* Brow pain
* Ocular burning, redness, and stinging
* Eyelid twitching

Serious side effects, though less frequent, are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.  These might include severe eye pain, changes in vision, or signs of systemic toxicity (affecting the whole body).

### How it Works
Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor.  This means it works by blocking the action of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase.  Acetylcholinesterase normally breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in constricting the muscles of the eye.  By blocking acetylcholinesterase, physostigmine increases the amount of acetylcholine available, leading to contraction of the ciliary muscle in the eye. This contraction improves the outflow of fluid from the eye, reducing intraocular pressure.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Physostigmine ophthalmic is contraindicated in patients with acute iritis (inflammation of the iris) or acute uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye).
* **Increased Risk:** Prolonged use in dark-skinned patients may increase the risk of depigmentation (loss of color) of the eyelid margins. There is also an increased risk of systemic toxicity (effects extending beyond the eye).
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with acute inflammatory diseases of the anterior segment of the eye, a history of retinal detachment, or in children with myopia (nearsightedness).
* **Drug Interactions:** Specific drug interaction studies haven't been conducted with physostigmine ophthalmic.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Physostigmine is categorized as pregnancy category C.  This means studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there is no adequate information in pregnant women.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so use with caution during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use physostigmine ophthalmic if I wear contact lenses?** A: No. Remove contact lenses before instillation and wait at least 15 minutes after application before reinserting them.

* **Q: How should I store physostigmine ophthalmic?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop using physostigmine ophthalmic suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to a rebound increase in intraocular pressure.

* **Q:  What should I do if I accidentally get too much physostigmine in my eye?**  A: Immediately rinse your eye with plenty of cool water and contact your doctor or ophthalmologist.
