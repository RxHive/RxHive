# Perindopril arginine + Amlodipine
### Generic Name
Perindopril arginine + Amlodipine

### Usage
Perindopril arginine + Amlodipine is a combination medication used primarily to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's prescribed for individuals whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication.  This combination therapy is also considered for patients who are likely to require multiple drugs to reach their blood pressure goals.  The drug combines the effects of an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) to effectively lower blood pressure.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Hypertension):**  The typical starting dose is Perindopril arginine 3.5 mg + Amlodipine 2.5 mg, taken once daily.  The dose is adjusted based on individual blood pressure responses.  Increases in dosage should be spaced 7-14 days apart.  The maximum recommended dose is Perindopril arginine 14 mg + Amlodipine 10 mg once daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Perindopril arginine + Amlodipine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** This combination is generally not recommended for patients with liver problems because perindopril's bioavailability increases, and amlodipine's clearance decreases in this population.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with reduced kidney function.  For creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 30-80 mL/min, the maximum dose is typically Perindopril arginine 7 mg + Amlodipine 5 mg daily.  It's generally not recommended for patients with CrCl less than 30 mL/min.  Both perindopril and its active metabolite are dialyzable, but amlodipine is not.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Exacerbation of angina (chest pain)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Cough
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include myocardial infarction (heart attack), renal insufficiency (kidney impairment), and angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.

### How it Works
Perindopril, an ACE inhibitor, works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).  This enzyme is involved in raising blood pressure. By inhibiting ACE, perindopril reduces the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (blood vessel constrictor).  This leads to lower blood pressure, and also reduces aldosterone secretion (a hormone that affects fluid and electrolyte balance).

Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, relaxes blood vessels by reducing the flow of calcium ions into the muscle cells of the heart and blood vessels.  This relaxation causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing the resistance to blood flow and lowering blood pressure. The combination of these two mechanisms provides a synergistic effect on lowering blood pressure.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to perindopril, amlodipine, other ACE inhibitors, other dihydropyridine derivatives, or any formulation component; hereditary or idiopathic angioedema; and concomitant use with aliskiren in diabetic patients. Avoid use with or within 36 hours of switching to or from a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions can occur with diuretics (leading to excessive blood pressure drops), potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (increasing risk of hyperkalemia), lithium (increasing lithium levels), NSAIDs (potentially impairing kidney function), and other medications affecting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are currently taking. Specific interactions are noted with Simvastatin and Cyclosporine for Amlodipine component.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Perindopril arginine + Amlodipine is categorized as Pregnancy Category D. Use during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, can cause fetal injury and death.  Discontinue use immediately if pregnancy is detected. Amlodipine is excreted in breast milk; the excretion of perindopril is unknown. Discontinuation of breastfeeding or therapy is recommended.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, collagen vascular disease (especially with renal impairment), hepatic impairment, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, renal artery stenosis, or before/during/after major surgery.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Perindopril arginine + Amlodipine with food?** A:  This medication can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.
