# Palifermin
### Generic Name
Palifermin

### Usage
Palifermin is primarily used to reduce the severity and duration of severe oral mucositis.  Oral mucositis is a painful inflammation and ulceration of the mouth lining, a common and debilitating side effect of high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy often used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies (cancers of the blood-forming tissues).  Specifically, Palifermin is indicated for patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (autologous HSCT).  Autologous HSCT involves harvesting the patient's own stem cells, then using high-dose chemotherapy to destroy cancerous cells, followed by reinfusion of the harvested stem cells to restore the bone marrow.  Palifermin's use is targeted to this specific context to mitigate the severe oral mucositis often associated with these intensive treatment regimens.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For oral mucositis associated with autologous HSCT conditioning regimens, the recommended dose is 60 mcg/kg/day administered intravenously (IV) for three consecutive days before and three consecutive days after myelotoxic therapy (chemotherapy).  This totals six doses.  Crucially, the first three doses are given before the myelotoxic therapy begins, with the third dose given 24–48 hours prior to starting chemotherapy. The remaining three doses are given after completion of myelotoxic therapy, starting on the same day as the HSCT infusion (but after it) and at least 7 days after the last dose of Palifermin.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Palifermin in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

*   Edema (swelling)
*   Pain
*   Dysesthesia (abnormal sensation)
*   Skin rash
*   Pruritus (itching)
*   Erythema (redness)
*   Increased serum amylase and lipase levels (indicating potential pancreas involvement; usually resolves without intervention)
*   Mouth discoloration
*   Swelling of the mouth
*   Tongue discoloration
*   Tongue edema (swelling)
*   Dysgeusia (altered taste)
*   Fever

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1–10% or less of patients):**

*   Development of antibodies against Palifermin
*   Arthralgia (joint pain)
*   Cataract
*   Cough
*   Genital edema
*   Hyperpigmentation
*   Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome)
*   Perineal pain
*   Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes)
*   Vaginal disease (erythema)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Palifermin is a recombinant keratinocyte growth factor (KGF).  KGF is a naturally occurring protein that stimulates the growth and repair of epithelial cells, which are the cells lining the mouth, esophagus, and other tissues.  By binding to its receptor (KGFR), Palifermin promotes the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of these cells, helping to accelerate the healing process and reduce the severity of oral mucositis.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Palifermin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Palifermin or its components.

**Interactions:** Palifermin may enhance the adverse effects of antineoplastic agents (chemotherapy drugs).  Concomitant use is generally not recommended.  Heparin (a blood thinner) may increase Palifermin serum concentrations; concurrent use should be avoided.

**Warnings:** Palifermin may increase the risk of mucocutaneous (skin and mucous membrane) effects such as edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, oral/perioral dysesthesia, taste alterations, tongue discoloration, and tongue thickening.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Palifermin may cause fetal harm.  It is not known whether Palifermin is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended during Palifermin treatment.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Palifermin administered?**  A: Palifermin is administered intravenously (IV) as a bolus injection.

*   **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: Palifermin's effect is seen in the reduction of the severity and duration of oral mucositis. The timing varies depending on the individual and the intensity of the chemotherapy.

*   **Q: How should Palifermin be stored?** A:  Store Palifermin according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated.

*   **Q: Can I take other medications with Palifermin?** A:  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your healthcare provider before starting Palifermin to ensure there are no harmful interactions.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider immediately to determine the appropriate course of action.

*   **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Palifermin?** A:  Long-term effects are not yet fully understood.  Follow-up with your healthcare provider for ongoing monitoring.
