# Porfimer Sodium
### Generic Name
Porfimer Sodium

### Usage
Porfimer sodium is a medication used in photodynamic therapy (PDT).  PDT is a treatment that combines a light-sensitive drug (like porfimer sodium) with a specific type of laser light to destroy cancerous or precancerous cells.  Its primary use is as a palliative treatment (to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life, not to cure the disease) for patients with esophageal cancer that is completely or partially blocking the esophagus.  In such cases, it may be used when other treatments like Nd:YAG laser therapy aren't suitable.  It's also used to treat microinvasive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who aren't candidates for surgery or radiation, to reduce obstruction and palliate symptoms in patients with endobronchial NSCLC (NSCLC affecting the bronchi), and to ablate (destroy) high-grade dysplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus who are not undergoing esophagectomy (surgical removal of the esophagus).  Off-label uses, meaning uses not officially approved but sometimes employed by clinicians, include the treatment of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile duct).

### Dosage
Dosage is determined by the healthcare provider based on individual patient needs and the specific condition being treated.  The typical intravenous (IV) dose is 2 mg/kg of body weight.  This is followed by endoscopic exposure to the appropriate laser light and, in the case of esophageal cancer, debridement (removal of damaged tissue).

* **Esophageal cancer & Endobronchial NSCLC (PDT):**  2 mg/kg IV, followed by laser light exposure and debridement.  Courses must be at least 30 days apart, with a maximum of 3 courses.
* **Barrett's Esophagus Dysplasia (PDT):** 2 mg/kg IV, followed by laser light exposure.  Courses must be at least 90 days apart, with a maximum of 3 courses.
* **Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma (Off-label):** 2 mg/kg IV, followed by light activation 48 hours later.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of porfimer sodium in children have not been established.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in these cases because elimination of porfimer sodium and photosensitivity may be prolonged.

### Side Effects
Porfimer sodium can cause various side effects, ranging from common to rare and serious.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to a healthcare professional immediately.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Pain
* Insomnia
* Chest pain
* Edema (swelling)
* Esophageal stenosis (narrowing)
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Skin photosensitivity
* Anemia
* Back pain
* Pleural effusion (fluid buildup around the lungs)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Bronchial obstruction
* Cough
* Fever
* Serous drainage (thin, watery fluid)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less):**  These include, but aren't limited to:  confusion, anxiety, voice disorders, various cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, heart failure, etc.),  severe gastrointestinal issues (perforation, bleeding, ulcers), jaundice, various respiratory complications (pneumonia, respiratory failure),  and ophthalmic problems (eye pain, vision changes).

**Rare and Post-Marketing Side Effects:** These include, but aren't limited to:  cataracts, stroke, skin nodules, fluid imbalances, fragile skin, severe GI complications,  hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth), infusion reactions, tissue necrosis, pseudoporphyria, sepsis, and skin discoloration.


### How it Works
Porfimer sodium is a photosensitizing agent.  After it's administered intravenously, it selectively accumulates in cancerous or precancerous cells.  When exposed to specific wavelengths of laser light (typically >630 nm), it generates oxygen free radicals, which damage and destroy the targeted cells.  Additionally, the release of thromboxane A2 can lead to vascular occlusion (blocking of blood vessels) and ischemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of blood supply).


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Porfimer sodium is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to porphyrins, porphyria, certain esophageal or airway conditions (fistulas, tumors eroding into major vessels, etc.), specific bladder cancer conditions, and patients with other conditions as determined by their physician.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Porfimer sodium can interact with other photosensitizing agents, potentially increasing the risk of photosensitivity reactions. Careful monitoring is necessary if other photosensitizing drugs are used concurrently.
* **Warnings:**  Porfimer sodium carries a risk of various serious side effects, including but not limited to photosensitivity reactions,  hemorrhage, thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation,  airway obstruction, and esophageal strictures.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Porfimer sodium is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It has the potential to harm a developing fetus and should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the risks.  Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for five months after treatment.  The excretion of porfimer sodium in breast milk is unknown.
* **Special Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does photosensitivity last after treatment?** A: Photosensitivity can last for 30-60 days after treatment.  Patients must protect their skin from direct sunlight and bright indoor light during this time.  Ambient indoor light is generally acceptable.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, no matter how minor they seem, to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: How is porfimer sodium stored?** A: The reconstituted solution should be protected from bright light and used immediately.  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.

* **Q: Is porfimer sodium a cure for cancer?** A: No, porfimer sodium is primarily used as a palliative treatment to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with certain types of cancer. It does not cure the disease.

* **Q: Are there any alternative treatments?** A: Yes, several other treatments exist for the conditions porfimer sodium treats.  Your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment based on your individual circumstances.  These other options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or other photodynamic therapy agents.
