# Procyclidine
### Generic Name
Procyclidine

### Usage
Procyclidine is primarily used to manage various forms of Parkinsonism, including postencephalitic Parkinsonism (caused by encephalitis), arteriosclerotic Parkinsonism (related to hardening of the arteries in the brain), and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (where the cause is unknown).  It works by reducing the symptoms associated with these conditions.  Importantly, Procyclidine is also used to alleviate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are side effects that can occur with certain antipsychotic medications.  These EPS can manifest as dystonia (muscle spasms), dyskinesia (involuntary movements), akathisia (restlessness), and parkinsonism-like symptoms.  Procyclidine helps to control these movement disorders caused by medications like phenothiazines and Rauwolfia compounds.  It's also sometimes used off-label to treat excessive salivation (sialorrhea) caused by other medications.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Parkinson's Disease:**  Typically starts with 2.5 mg three times a day (TID) after meals. The dose is gradually increased, often up to 15-30 mg daily, divided into doses throughout the day and at bedtime as needed.  Lower doses may be sufficient for some.
* **Extrapyramidal Adverse Effects (EPS):**  Begins at 2.5 mg TID after meals, titrating upwards in increments of 2.5 mg daily until symptoms improve.  The usual daily dose is 10-20 mg in divided doses.
* **Acute Dystonic Reactions:** For immediate relief of severe muscle spasms, 5-10 mg can be given by intramuscular (IM) injection, with a possible repeat dose after 20 minutes if necessary. The maximum daily dose in this setting is 20 mg.  Intravenous (IV) administration may also be used in emergency situations, typically 5-10 mg, potentially requiring higher doses depending on the patient's response.
* **Sialorrhea (Off-label):** Oral administration usually starts at 2.5 mg TID, gradually increasing to 10-30 mg daily in divided doses until satisfactory relief is achieved.  The maximum daily dose is 30 mg. Parenteral (IM or IV) administration (5-10 mg) might be used in emergency situations, with a potential repeat dose after 20 minutes.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Procyclidine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, but caution is advised in these patient groups.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Blurred vision
* Mydriasis (widened pupils)
* Skin rash
* Weakness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Acute suppurative parotitis (inflammation of the salivary gland)
* Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Procyclidine is an anticholinergic drug.  This means it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in muscle contractions and other bodily functions. In Parkinson's disease, there's an imbalance between acetylcholine and another neurotransmitter, dopamine. Procyclidine helps restore a better balance by reducing the effects of acetylcholine. This helps to alleviate the muscle rigidity, tremors, and other motor symptoms associated with Parkinsonism.  Similarly, it counteracts the effects of excess acetylcholine that can cause EPS induced by antipsychotics.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Procyclidine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, narrow-angle glaucoma, untreated urinary retention, and gastrointestinal obstruction.
* **Interactions:**  Procyclidine can interact with numerous medications, including MAO inhibitors, other anticholinergic drugs, cholinergic drugs, parasympathomimetic agents, nitrate tablets, levodopa, cisapride, domperidone, metoclopramide, quinidine, and ketoconazole. Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking to avoid potentially harmful interactions.  Paroxetine should be avoided.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, bowel obstruction, ulcerative colitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary stricture, tardive dyskinesia, renal or hepatic impairment, and geriatric patients (dose reduction may be needed).  Procyclidine increases the risk of anhidrosis (reduced sweating) and hyperthermia (increased body temperature).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Procyclidine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Procyclidine?**  A:  No, it is recommended to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery because Procyclidine can cause dizziness and blurred vision.
* **Q: How should I store Procyclidine?**  A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Procyclidine suddenly?**  A: No, always talk to your doctor before stopping Procyclidine to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms.
