# Proguanil

**Generic Name:** Proguanil

**Usage:** Proguanil is an antimalarial drug used to prevent malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, *Plasmodium vivax*, *Plasmodium ovale*, and *Plasmodium malariae*.  It's often used in combination with other antimalarials, most commonly atovaquone (MalaroneÂ®).  Proguanil alone is less effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of *P. falciparum*.  It's typically started 1-2 days before entering a malaria-risk area and continued for 4 weeks after leaving.  The exact dosage and duration depend on the specific risk and the recommendations of a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**  Side Effects can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Fatigue

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Anemia
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine)
* Kidney problems
* Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, swelling)
* Blood disorders

**How it Works:** Proguanil is a pro-drug, meaning it's converted in the body into its active form, cycloguanil. Cycloguanil inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme essential for the parasite's DNA synthesis and replication. By inhibiting DHFR, the parasite's growth and multiplication are suppressed, preventing the development of malaria.  This mechanism is similar to that of pyrimethamine.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Proguanil effective against all types of malaria?** While effective against several *Plasmodium* species, it is less effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of *P. falciparum*.  It's often used in combination with other drugs for broader protection.

* **Can I take Proguanil if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks, and only under strict medical supervision.  There are safer alternatives for malaria prevention during pregnancy.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects often resolve on their own. If you experience severe side effects or if symptoms persist or worsen, consult a doctor immediately.

* **Can I buy Proguanil over the counter?**  No, Proguanil is usually only available with a prescription from a doctor.

* **How should I store Proguanil?** Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Proguanil?**  Alcohol might increase the risk of some side effects.  Consult your doctor regarding alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
