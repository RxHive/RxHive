# Proguanil
### Generic Name
Proguanil

### Usage
Proguanil is primarily used in the prevention (chemoprophylaxis) and treatment of malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes.  Its main target is malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, a particularly dangerous species. While not its primary indication, Proguanil can also be used in combination with other medications to treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax*.  It's important to note that Proguanil is generally used in combination with other antimalarial drugs, especially for treatment, rather than as a standalone therapy.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (*P. falciparum*):** 200 mg orally once daily. Start 1 week (or at least 2 days) before entering a malaria-endemic area, continue throughout the stay, and for 4 weeks after returning.
* **Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (*P. falciparum*) – Combination with Atovaquone:** 100 mg orally once daily, combined with 250 mg of atovaquone. Start 1-2 days before entering the endemic area, continue throughout the stay, and for 7 weeks after returning.
* **Malaria Treatment (*P. falciparum*) – Uncomplicated Disease – Combination with Atovaquone:** 400 mg orally once daily for 3 days, combined with 1000 mg of atovaquone daily.
* **Malaria Treatment (*P. vivax*) – Off-label Use – Combination with Atovaquone and Primaquine:** 400 mg Proguanil with 1000 mg atovaquone once daily for 3 days, combined with 52.6 mg of oral primaquine phosphate daily for 14 days.  (Note: This off-label use requires careful medical supervision).

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (*P. falciparum*):** Dosage varies by age:
    * Infants < 1 year: 25 mg once daily
    * Children 1-4 years: 50 mg once daily
    * Children 5-8 years: 100 mg once daily
    * Children 9-12 years and adolescents 13-14 years: 150 mg once daily
    * Adolescents > 14 years: Refer to adult dosing.
    Start 1 week (or at least 2 days) before entering a malaria-endemic area, continue throughout the stay, and for 4 weeks after returning.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):
    * CrCl ≥ 60 mL/minute: No adjustment needed.
    * CrCl 20-59 mL/minute: 100 mg once daily.
    * CrCl 10-19 mL/minute: 50 mg every other day.
    * CrCl < 10 mL/minute: 50 mg once weekly.

### Side Effects

* Common side effects:  The frequency of these side effects isn't consistently defined in available literature.
* Cardiovascular: Vasculitis
* Dermatologic: Alopecia (hair loss), skin exfoliation, itching (pruritus), skin rash, urticaria (hives)
* Gastrointestinal: Cholestasis (reduced bile flow), constipation, diarrhea, mouth sores (oral mucosa ulcer), stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth)
* Hematologic and Oncologic: Aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure), megaloblastic anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency), pancytopenia (deficiency of all blood cell types)
* Hypersensitivity: Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), allergic reactions
* Other: Fever


**Serious (but less common) side effects:** The above list includes some serious side effects.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual symptoms.

### How it Works

Proguanil is a biguanide derivative that's metabolized in the body to its active form, cycloguanil.  Cycloguanil works by inhibiting an enzyme called dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in the malaria parasite. This enzyme is crucial for the parasite's DNA synthesis and replication. By blocking DHFR, cycloguanil prevents the parasite from making DNA, ultimately inhibiting its growth and reproduction.  Proguanil is effective against the pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite's life cycle (before it invades red blood cells) and acts as a slow-acting blood schizontocide (killing the parasite in red blood cells).

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Proguanil is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to proguanil or any component of the formulation.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients with renal impairment; dosage adjustments are necessary as described above.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The pregnancy category is unknown. Proguanil may be used in combination with atovaquone as an alternative treatment for malaria in pregnant women, but under strict medical supervision.  Because proguanil is a folate antagonist, folic acid supplementation is recommended if used during pregnancy. Proguanil is excreted in breast milk but is considered compatible with breastfeeding when used for maternal malaria prophylaxis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids can reduce the absorption of proguanil; avoid concurrent use. Proguanil may potentiate the effects of warfarin and similar anticoagulants; avoid concurrent use.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Proguanil with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Proguanil to avoid potentially harmful interactions.
* **Q: How should I store Proguanil?** A: Store Proguanil as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Is Proguanil safe for everyone?** A:  Proguanil is generally safe for most people when used as directed, but it may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with kidney problems or hypersensitivity.  Consult a doctor before taking it.
* **Q:  What are the signs of a severe allergic reaction?** A:  Signs of a severe allergic reaction include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives. Seek immediate medical help if you experience any of these.
