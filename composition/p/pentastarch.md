# Pentastarch
### Generic Name
Pentastarch

### Usage
Pentastarch, a hydroxyethyl starch derivative, is a synthetic colloid and plasma volume expander. Its primary use is as an adjunct in managing shock caused by hemorrhage, surgery, sepsis, burns, or other trauma, where plasma volume expansion is needed.  It's crucial to note that the use of hydroxyethyl starch, including Pentastarch, is *not* recommended for fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis and septic shock, according to the SCCM guidelines (2017).  While it can expand plasma volume, it's not a replacement for red blood cells or clotting factors.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  For shock and plasma volume expansion, Pentastarch (10% in 0.9% sodium chloride injection) is administered intravenously. The dosage ranges from 500 to 2000 mL, infused at a rate up to 20 mL/kg/h. The maximum daily dose is 28 mL/kg or 2000 mL.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Pentastarch in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Pentastarch should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  In patients with hepatic impairment, it may further reduce coagulation factor levels, increasing bleeding risk; it's contraindicated in those with severe liver disease.  In patients with renal impairment, fluid status (including urine output) must be closely monitored; it's contraindicated in cases of oliguria (reduced urine output) or anuria (absence of urine output) unrelated to hypovolemia (low blood volume).


### Side Effects
Common side effects (frequency not specified in available data) may include:

* Nervous system: Anxiety, chills, dizziness, fatigue, fever, headache, insomnia, malaise, shakiness
* Cardiovascular: Angina, edema, tachycardia
* Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea
* Endocrine and metabolic: Increased amylase levels
* Hematologic: Coagulation disorders, hemorrhage
* Hepatic: Increased bilirubin levels
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Paresthesia, weakness
* Others: Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, hypersensitivity (hypotension, urticaria, wheezing)

Less common but serious side effects include renal failure, and an increased risk of mortality in critically ill patients.  Any adverse effects should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Pentastarch expands plasma volume due to its highly colloidal starch structure.  This increased volume helps improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion in shock states.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Pentastarch is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to hydroxyethyl starch or any formulation component, bleeding disorders, sepsis, severe liver disease, oliguria/anuria (not related to hypovolemia), and congestive heart failure where volume overload is a concern.

**Warnings:** There's an increased risk of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, hematologic changes (reduced hemoglobin, impaired coagulation, prolonged bleeding time), bleeding, renal failure, and mortality (especially in the critically ill).  Large volumes may cause fluid overload.

**Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure, active hemorrhage, mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, renal impairment, risk of blood volume overexpansion (very young or old patients, those with heart failure), corn allergy, or breastfeeding.

**Drug Interactions:** Pentastarch may enhance the nephrotoxic effects of arbekacin; concurrent use should be avoided.


### FAQs

**Q: What is Pentastarch used for?**
A: Pentastarch is used as an adjunct treatment to help manage shock caused by various conditions like hemorrhage, surgery, sepsis, burns, or trauma by expanding plasma volume.  However, it's not a replacement for blood transfusions or treatment of the underlying cause of shock.

**Q: Are there any precautions I should take when using Pentastarch?**
A:  Yes, several precautions exist.  It shouldn't be used in patients with certain conditions (see contraindications and warnings above).  Close monitoring of vital signs and renal and coagulation parameters are essential.

**Q: What are the possible side effects?**
A: Side effects range from mild (e.g., nausea, dizziness) to serious (e.g., anaphylaxis, renal failure).  Any unusual symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

**Q: How is Pentastarch administered?**
A: Pentastarch is given intravenously (IV). The rate and total dose will be determined by a healthcare provider based on individual patient needs.

**Q: How should Pentastarch be stored?**
A:  Storage instructions should be found on the product labeling.  Generally, this involves keeping the medication at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
