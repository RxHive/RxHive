# Pipotiazine
### Generic Name
Pipotiazine

### Usage
Pipotiazine is a typical antipsychotic medication primarily used for the maintenance treatment of chronic schizophrenia in patients who are not experiencing acute agitation.  It's important to note that pipotiazine is discontinued in many countries and its availability varies geographically.  Its use is largely restricted to situations where other antipsychotics are ineffective or poorly tolerated.  It's not typically used for the initial treatment of acute psychotic episodes.

### Dosage

Pipotiazine is administered solely via intramuscular injection. Dosage is highly individualized and determined based on the patient's response.  There is no established pediatric use.

**Adults (Schizophrenia - Maintenance Treatment):**

* **Initial Dose:** 50-100 mg, adjusted upwards in 25 mg increments every 2-3 weeks as needed.
* **Maintenance Dose:** Typically 75-150 mg every 4 weeks.  However, the optimal dosage and frequency may range from 25-250 mg every 3-4 weeks.  A lower dose more frequently administered may prove more beneficial than larger, less frequent doses for certain individuals.  
* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Pipotiazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:  hypotension (low blood pressure),  QT prolongation (on ECG), syncope (fainting), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), agitation, anxiety, disturbed sleep, dizziness, drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as akathisia (restlessness), dystonia (muscle spasms), pseudoparkinsonism (Parkinson's-like symptoms),  restlessness, tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements), skin rash, changes in libido, weight changes, nausea, constipation, and blurred vision.

Less common but serious side effects include:  neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS),  cholestatic jaundice (liver dysfunction),  and corneal or retinal changes with prolonged use.  If any adverse effects occur, immediate medical attention is necessary.

### How it Works

Pipotiazine is a dopamine receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain that's thought to be involved in the development of schizophrenia symptoms. By reducing dopamine activity, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway, pipotiazine helps alleviate psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. Additionally, it depresses the release of certain hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones.  Pipotiazine palmitate, a long-acting ester form, provides a prolonged therapeutic effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pipotiazine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to pipotiazine or other phenothiazines, suspected or established subcortical brain damage, psychoneurotic conditions or agitation in geriatric patients, hepatic or renal dysfunction, circulatory collapse, severe cardiovascular disorders, severe depression, blood dyscrasias, altered states of consciousness (especially from CNS depressants), or pheochromocytoma.
* **Interactions:**  Pipotiazine interacts with numerous medications, including but not limited to other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, sedatives), anticholinergics,  antidepressants, and other antipsychotics.  The potential for additive or antagonistic effects necessitates careful monitoring when co-administering pipotiazine with other drugs. Consult a healthcare professional regarding potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Pipotiazine should be avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  Neonatal withdrawal symptoms are possible.  Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the unknown excretion in breast milk.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Increased risk of death has been observed in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotics.  Pipotiazine should be used with extreme caution in this population.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for pipotiazine to work?** A: The onset and duration of effect vary greatly between individuals.


* **Q: Can I stop taking pipotiazine suddenly?** A: No, abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Discontinuation should be done gradually under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should I store pipotiazine?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Is pipotiazine habit-forming?** A: Pipotiazine is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids but can lead to dependence in the sense that the body adapts to its presence, necessitating gradual withdrawal to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately to get guidance on how to proceed.  Do not double the next dose.
