# Pimozide
### Generic Name
Pimozide

### Usage
Pimozide is primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome, specifically to suppress both motor (movement-related) and phonic (sound-related) tics in individuals who haven't responded adequately to other standard treatments.  While not its primary indication, pimozide has also been used in the treatment of schizophrenia, monosymptomatic hypochondria (severe preoccupation with the fear of having a serious illness), and certain paranoid states.  However, the use of pimozide in these conditions is less common and often considered only after other treatment options have been explored.

### Dosage

**Tourette Syndrome:**

* **Adults:** The initial dose is typically 1-2 mg daily, divided into multiple doses.  This dose may be gradually increased, usually every other day, based on the individual's response, up to a maximum of 10 mg/day or 0.2 mg/kg/day.  If a dose greater than 4 mg/day is needed, a CYP2D6 test (to determine how the body processes the medication) is recommended.  In individuals who are poor metabolizers of this enzyme, dose increases should be made over at least 14 days, and the maximum dose should not exceed 4 mg/day.  Elderly patients usually start with a lower dose of 1 mg/day, and dose reduction should be attempted periodically to find the lowest effective dose.
* **Children (≥12 years):** The starting dose is generally 0.05 mg/kg, preferably given once at bedtime. The dose can be increased every third day, not exceeding 0.2 mg/kg or 10 mg/day.  Careful monitoring is crucial in pediatric patients.

**Schizophrenia:**

* **Adults:**  Treatment starts with 2 mg once daily, adjusted based on response in increments of 2-4 mg at intervals of at least one week. The usual dose range is 2-20 mg/day.  Elderly patients usually start at half the adult initial dose.

**Monosymptomatic Hypochondria and Paranoid States:**

* **Adults:** The initial dose is typically 4 mg once daily, adjusted according to response by increments of 2-4 mg at intervals of at least one week.  The maximum dose is 16 mg/day. Elderly patients typically begin with half the adult starting dose.


**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in individuals with impaired liver or kidney function, and those who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6.  The prescribing physician should guide dosage based on individual needs and careful monitoring. Pimozide is usually administered orally as a tablet.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Sedation, drowsiness, akathisia (restlessness), behavioral changes, hypertonia (increased muscle tone), xerostomia (dry mouth), constipation, decreased accommodation (blurred vision), visual disturbances, akinesia (slowed movement), and weakness.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Depression, insomnia, speech disturbances, nervousness, writing difficulty, headaches, abnormal dreams, ECG abnormalities, skin rash, photophobia (light sensitivity), increased thirst, sialorrhea (excessive salivation), diarrhea, altered taste, increased appetite, difficulty swallowing, muscle rigidity, stooped posture, hyperkinesia (excessive movement), muscle pain, torticollis (neck spasms), tremor, dizziness, excitement, extrapyramidal reactions (dystonia, pseudoparkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS – a severe and potentially life-threatening condition), palpitations, seizures, chest pain, hypertension, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality that can be dangerous), syncope (fainting), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), ventricular arrhythmias, blurred vision, cataracts, periorbital edema (swelling around the eyes), diaphoresis (excessive sweating), skin irritation, decreased libido, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), weight changes, nocturia (frequent nighttime urination), hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), polyuria (excessive urination), and gingival hyperplasia (overgrowth of gum tissue).

**If any adverse effects occur, especially severe or unusual ones, consult a healthcare professional immediately.**

### How it Works
Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication that primarily works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS).  In Tourette syndrome, this dopamine blockade is believed to be the primary mechanism by which it reduces tics.  The exact mechanism in schizophrenia, hypochondria, and paranoid states is less fully understood but likely involves modulation of other neurotransmitter systems in the brain beyond dopamine.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pimozide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components, those concurrently taking certain CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors (medications that can interfere with its metabolism), those with a history of cardiac arrhythmias or congenital long QT syndrome, those taking QTc-prolonging drugs, and those with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (low potassium or magnesium levels). Pimozide is also not appropriate for simple tics or tics not associated with Tourette syndrome.

* **Drug Interactions:** Pimozide can interact significantly with many other drugs.  Concurrent use with drugs that cause electrolyte imbalances, CNS depressants, anti-emetics, sibutramine, calcium-channel blockers, levodopa, or various CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors should be avoided.  Use with SSRIs or TCAs may increase the risk of extrapyramidal effects.  Concomitant use with other QTc-prolonging agents also poses a serious risk.

* **Warnings:**  Pimozide should be used cautiously in individuals with decreased gastrointestinal motility, urinary retention, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, risk of seizures, hepatic or renal impairment, or those at risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.  It may cause orthostatic hypotension, so patients should be advised to change positions slowly.  Regular monitoring of blood counts, ECG, and other relevant parameters is critical.  Elderly individuals and those with existing cardiovascular disease should be monitored closely.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a physician as pimozide may pose risks to the fetus or infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take pimozide with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking. Many drugs interact with pimozide, some dangerously.  Your doctor must assess the potential for interactions before prescribing it concurrently with other drugs.

* **Q: How should I store pimozide?** A: Store pimozide in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking pimozide suddenly?** A: No, abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous.  Always consult your doctor before stopping pimozide; they'll help you taper the dose gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Does pimozide cause weight gain?** A: Weight gain is a potential side effect of pimozide. Regular monitoring of weight and overall health are important.
