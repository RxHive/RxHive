# Pimozide

**Generic Name:** Pimozide

**Usage:** Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat:

* **Tourette's Syndrome:**  It helps to reduce the severity of tics and vocalizations associated with this condition.
* **Severe behavioral problems:** In children and adolescents, it may be used to treat severe behavioral problems that don't respond to other treatments.  This is becoming less common due to safety concerns.


**Side Effects:**  Pimozide can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, increased appetite, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping.
* **Serious side effects:** These are less common but require immediate medical attention. They include:
    * **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
    * **QT prolongation:** This can lead to serious heart rhythm problems, including potentially fatal arrhythmias.  Regular ECG monitoring is often required.
    * **Tardive dyskinesia (TD):**  A serious movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements of the face, mouth, tongue, and limbs.  This can be irreversible.
    * **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):** These include muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness, and involuntary movements.  These can be managed with other medications.
    * **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, which can cause dizziness or fainting.
    * **Blood disorders:** Changes in blood cell counts.
    * **Liver problems:** Elevated liver enzymes.
    * **Severe allergic reactions:** Rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** Pimozide is a dopamine receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  By blocking dopamine receptors, pimozide helps to reduce the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome and severe behavioral problems, although the exact mechanism isn't fully understood.  The effect on dopamine pathways is thought to be responsible for both the therapeutic effects and the side effects.

**FAQs:**

* **Is pimozide addictive?**  Pimozide is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or benzodiazepines. However, psychological dependence can develop if the medication is abruptly stopped after prolonged use.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking pimozide?** Alcohol should be avoided while taking pimozide as it can worsen side effects, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.
* **Can I drive while taking pimozide?**  Drowsiness and dizziness are common side effects. Do not drive or operate machinery until you know how pimozide affects you.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of pimozide may not be immediately noticeable. It may take several weeks to see a significant improvement in symptoms.
* **Can pimozide be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Pimozide should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Discuss this with your doctor.
* **What are the long-term risks of pimozide?**  Long-term use of pimozide carries a risk of tardive dyskinesia and other serious side effects.  Regular monitoring is crucial.
