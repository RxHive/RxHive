# Pegvaliase
### Generic Name
Pegvaliase

### Usage
Pegvaliase is a medication used to lower high levels of phenylalanine in the blood of adults with phenylketonuria (PKU).  PKU is a rare inherited disorder where the body can't break down phenylalanine, an amino acid found in protein-rich foods.  High phenylalanine levels can cause serious health problems, including intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral issues. Pegvaliase is prescribed only for adults whose blood phenylalanine levels remain high despite following a strict diet and other management strategies.  It is specifically indicated for those with uncontrolled blood phenylalanine concentrations greater than 600 µM/L on their current treatment.

### Dosage
Pegvaliase is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) and involves a three-phase approach:

* **Induction Phase (4 weeks):**  Begins with 2.5 mg once weekly.
* **Titration Phase:** After the induction phase, the dosage is gradually increased over several weeks, based on individual patient tolerance and response.  This involves increasing the frequency and then the dose, eventually reaching 10mg twice weekly, 10mg four times weekly, and finally, 10mg once daily.  Careful monitoring of phenylalanine levels is crucial during this phase.
* **Maintenance Phase:**  Once the optimal dosage is determined, maintenance usually starts with 20mg once daily for at least 24 weeks.  If this doesn't achieve a sufficient response (at least a 20% reduction in baseline blood phenylalanine or a level ≤600 µmol/L), the dose may be increased to a maximum of 40mg once daily.  Treatment should be discontinued if a response isn't seen after 16 weeks at the 40mg dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Pegvaliase in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Pegvaliase can cause several side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Anxiety
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Skin changes (rash, itching)
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Changes in serum protein levels
* Increased C-reactive protein
* Injection-site reactions
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase
* Oropharyngeal pain
* Cough
* Nasal congestion


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Serum sickness (allergic reaction)
* Anaphylaxis (severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) – this is a boxed warning.
*  Hypersensitivity reactions


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Pegvaliase is a modified enzyme (a PEGylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase or PAL).  It works by breaking down phenylalanine, the amino acid that builds up in the blood of individuals with PKU.  This breakdown converts phenylalanine into ammonia and trans-cinnamic acid, substances the body can eliminate. By reducing the amount of phenylalanine in the blood, Pegvaliase helps manage the symptoms and complications associated with PKU.

### Precautions
* **Anaphylaxis Risk:** Pegvaliase carries a significant risk of anaphylaxis. The initial dose should be administered under medical supervision, and patients should be observed for at least 60 minutes afterward. All patients should be prescribed and carry an epinephrine auto-injector.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Premedication with antihistamines may be considered, based on the patient's tolerability.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Pegvaliase during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.
* **Interactions:**  The effects of Pegvaliase might be altered by medications like medroxyprogesterone and other PEGylated drugs.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Dietary Considerations:** Dietary protein and phenylalanine intake must be carefully monitored throughout treatment to maintain safe blood phenylalanine levels (typically between 120-360 µmol/L).  Levels should be 120-360 µmol/L for 3 months prior to conception and throughout pregnancy. Avoid levels below 30 µmol/L.
* **Injection Site Rotation:** Rotate injection sites with each dose to minimize local reactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Pegvaliase stored?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The response to Pegvaliase varies among individuals.  Blood phenylalanine levels should be monitored regularly to assess efficacy.  A response should be seen within 24 weeks of being on the maintenance dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor immediately.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Pegvaliase suddenly?** A: No, discontinue only as directed by your healthcare provider.  Sudden cessation may lead to a rapid increase in blood phenylalanine levels.
* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term studies are ongoing.  Regular monitoring by your healthcare team is crucial.
