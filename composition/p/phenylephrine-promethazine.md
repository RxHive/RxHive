# Phenylephrine  +  Promethazine
### Generic Name
Phenylephrine + Promethazine

### Usage

This combination medication is used for the temporary relief of upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold.  It combines the effects of promethazine, an antihistamine that helps reduce allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes, with phenylephrine, a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.  The primary use is for symptomatic relief of cold and allergy symptoms, not for curing the underlying condition.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The following dosage information is for general guidance only.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully.  Dosage may need adjustment based on individual needs and response.

**Adults:**  For upper respiratory symptoms, the typical dose is 5 mL of an oral solution containing promethazine 6.25 mg and phenylephrine 5 mg every 4-6 hours.  The maximum daily dose is 30 mL.

**Children:** This combination is **contraindicated** (not recommended) for children under 2 years old. For children aged 2 to under 6 years, the dose is typically 1.25-2.5 mL of the oral solution every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 15 mL in 24 hours. For children aged 6 to under 12 years, the dose is 2.5-5 mL every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 30 mL daily.  Children aged 12 and older can typically take the adult dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal (kidney) impairment.  For patients with hepatic (liver) impairment, especially children, use should be avoided as the side effects of promethazine could be confused with symptoms of liver disease.  Always consult a healthcare professional before giving this medication to children or individuals with liver or kidney problems.

### How it Works

Promethazine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. This reduces inflammation and the associated allergy symptoms. Phenylephrine acts as a decongestant by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages. This decreases swelling and improves nasal airflow.
