# Proparacaine
### Generic Name
Proparacaine

### Usage
Proparacaine ophthalmic solution is a topical anesthetic used to numb the eyes temporarily.  Its primary use is for procedures involving the cornea and conjunctiva, such as tonometry (measuring eye pressure), gonioscopy (examining the drainage angle of the eye), removal of corneal foreign bodies, and short surgical procedures. It can also be used to ease the discomfort of suture removal from the cornea.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**

* **Short corneal and conjunctival procedures:** 0.5% ophthalmic solution: Instill 1 drop into the affected eye(s) every 5-10 minutes for a total of 5-7 doses.
* **Tonometry, gonioscopy, or suture removal:** 0.5% ophthalmic solution: Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) immediately before the procedure.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The dosage for infants, children, and adolescents is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  Always consult a doctor for guidance.

### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Burning sensation in the eyes
* Stinging in the eyes
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva)
* Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the conjunctiva)
* Eye redness
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation)
* Corneal erosion (damage to the cornea's surface)


Less common, but more serious side effects include hypersensitivity reactions (characterized by acute keratitis, corneal changes, and potentially iritis), and allergic contact dermatitis.  Prolonged use can increase the risk of permanent corneal opacification and visual loss.  If you experience any of these side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Proparacaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses in the eye. It does this by affecting the permeability of ions across the nerve cell membrane, thus preventing pain signals from reaching the brain. This results in temporary numbness of the treated area, allowing for painless procedures.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Proparacaine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to proparacaine or any component of the formulation.
* **Warnings:**  Prolonged use increases the risk of corneal damage and visual loss. Systemic toxicity is a possibility with excessive use.  Use with caution in breastfeeding women as excretion into breast milk is unknown.
* **Interactions:** The effects of proparacaine may be increased by medications associated with methemoglobinemia (a condition where the blood's ability to carry oxygen is reduced).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Proparacaine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully understood.  Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed and weigh the benefits against potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised when using in breastfeeding women.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the numbing effect last?** A: The duration of numbness varies, but generally lasts for a short period, typically 15-30 minutes.
* **Q: Can I use Proparacaine more often than prescribed?** A: No.  Excessive use can lead to serious side effects, including corneal damage.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.
* **Q: How should I store Proparacaine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat.  Discard any unused solution after the expiration date.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get Proparacaine in my eye and experience significant discomfort?** A: Rinse your eye thoroughly with clean water and contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.
* **Q: Can I use Proparacaine with contact lenses?** A:  Generally, contact lenses should be removed before applying Proparacaine and not reinserted until the numbing effect wears off.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.
