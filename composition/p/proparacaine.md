# Proparacaine

**Generic Name:** Proparacaine Hydrochloride

**Usage:** Proparacaine is a topical anesthetic used to numb the eyes before procedures such as eye exams, surgery, or removal of foreign bodies.  It can also be used to relieve pain and discomfort from corneal abrasions or other minor eye injuries.  It's typically used as eye drops.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, proparacaine can cause side effects, although they are generally mild and temporary. Common side effects include:

* **Burning or stinging:** A temporary sensation upon application.
* **Itching:**  A temporary feeling of itchiness around the eyes.
* **Temporary blurred vision:** This usually resolves quickly after the medication wears off.
* **Redness or irritation:**  Mild redness of the eye.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, allergic reactions, such as rash or swelling, can occur.


**How it Works:** Proparacaine is a topical anesthetic, meaning it numbs the area it's applied to without causing loss of consciousness.  It works by blocking the nerve signals that transmit pain sensations from the cornea and conjunctiva (the surface of the eye) to the brain.  This effect is temporary and wears off relatively quickly.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  Proparacaine typically takes effect within a few minutes of application.
* **How long does the numbing effect last?** The numbing effect usually lasts for 15-30 minutes.
* **Can I wear contact lenses after using proparacaine?**  It's generally recommended to wait at least 30 minutes after using proparacaine before reinserting contact lenses, to allow the numbing effect to wear off completely.
* **Can I drive after using proparacaine?**  Due to the potential for temporary blurred vision, it's advisable to avoid driving or operating machinery until your vision returns to normal.
* **What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of a severe allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or hives.
* **Is proparacaine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  While generally considered safe, it's best to consult with your doctor or ophthalmologist before using proparacaine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Can I use proparacaine for long-term pain relief?** No. Proparacaine is only for short-term pain relief and should not be used repeatedly or for extended periods without consulting a doctor.  Frequent use can damage the surface of the eye.
* **Can children use proparacaine?**  Yes, proparacaine can be used in children, but only under the supervision of a doctor or ophthalmologist.
