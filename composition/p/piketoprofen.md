# Piketoprofen
### Generic Name
Piketoprofen

### Usage
Piketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used topically to relieve pain and inflammation associated with mild to moderate muscle or joint pain, and pain from soft tissue injuries.  It's primarily used for localized pain relief and isn't intended for systemic effects.

### Dosage
**Adults:**

* **Muscle or joint pain:**
    * **Spray solution (33.28 mg/mL):** Apply 1-2 sprays for a few seconds to the affected area three times a day (TID).
    * **Cream (18 mg/g):** Apply three or four times a day (TID or QID) in the first 24 hours after a soft tissue injury.  For ongoing muscle or joint pain, follow your doctor's advice on frequency.

**Children:** Piketoprofen is not recommended for use in children under 12 years old.  For adolescents over 12, the dosage is the same as for adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in individuals with pre-existing liver or kidney disease.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have any concerns.


### Side Effects
Common side effects:

* Application site reactions (redness, itching, burning, heat sensation)
* Eczema
* Contact dermatitis
* Photosensitivity reactions
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)

Less common but serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works
Piketoprofen belongs to the phenylpropionic acid class of NSAIDs. It works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthetase, an enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins. Prostaglandins contribute to inflammation and pain signaling. By reducing prostaglandin production, Piketoprofen helps alleviate both pain and inflammation at the application site.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Piketoprofen should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Piketoprofen, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.  Those with a history of allergic reactions like rhinitis, asthma, edema, or urticaria related to these medications should also avoid it.
* **Interactions:**  Piketoprofen can interact with various medications, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding (antiplatelet agents, tricyclic antidepressants, heparin), affecting blood pressure (beta-adrenergic agents), causing gastrointestinal toxicity (other NSAIDs), or impacting kidney function (ACE inhibitors).  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal ulcers, renal or hepatic dysfunction, hypertension, cardiac impairment, coagulation defects, or hypersensitivity to other NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Piketoprofen should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
