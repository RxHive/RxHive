# Pomalidomide
### Generic Name
Pomalidomide

### Usage
Pomalidomide is an antineoplastic (anticancer) medication primarily used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and Kaposi sarcoma.

**Multiple Myeloma:**  It's used in patients who have already received at least two other treatments, including lenalidomide and bortezomib, and whose disease has progressed despite those treatments or within 60 days of completing them.  Pomalidomide is typically given in combination with dexamethasone in this setting.

**Kaposi Sarcoma:** Pomalidomide is indicated for adults with Kaposi sarcoma that hasn't responded to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) if they are HIV-positive, or for HIV-negative adults with this condition.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's individual characteristics.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor.  The following information is for general understanding and should not be used in place of professional medical advice.

**Multiple Myeloma (Adults):** The typical oral dose is 4 mg once daily (OD) on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, given in combination with dexamethasone. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  Blood counts (ANC and platelets) need to be checked before each cycle.

**Kaposi Sarcoma (Adults):**  The typical oral dose is 5 mg OD on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle.  Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood counts (ANC and platelets) need to be checked before each cycle.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on factors like liver and kidney function, concomitant medications, and side effects.  For example, lower starting doses are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with severe kidney problems may require dose reductions or have their medication administered after dialysis.  Interaction with certain other medications may also necessitate dose adjustments.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose for you based on your specific circumstances.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of pomalidomide in children have not been established.

### How it Works

Pomalidomide's exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work in several ways to fight cancer:

* **Inhibition of Tumor Cell Growth:** It directly inhibits the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, leading to their death (apoptosis).
* **Immune System Modulation:** Pomalidomide affects the immune system, enhancing the activity of T-cells and natural killer cells, which helps the body fight the cancer.
* **Inflammation Reduction:** It reduces the production of certain inflammatory molecules (like TNF-alpha and interleukins), potentially mitigating some of the damage caused by the cancer.
* **Anti-angiogenesis:** It may also inhibit the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that tumors need to grow.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Pomalidomide is extremely harmful to a developing fetus and is strictly contraindicated during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing potential must adhere to strict contraception protocols before, during, and after treatment.  A specialized risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program is in place to minimize this risk.
* **Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking pomalidomide.
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are usually necessary in individuals with liver or kidney disease.
* **Other Medications:**  Pomalidomide can interact with other medications, especially those metabolized by the liver.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Thromboembolic Events:** Pomalidomide increases the risk of blood clots.  Your doctor may prescribe blood thinners to mitigate this risk.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Severe allergic reactions are possible.  Stop taking pomalidomide and seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like angioedema or anaphylaxis.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking pomalidomide?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking pomalidomide, as alcohol can increase the risk of some side effects.  Discuss this with your doctor.
* **Q: How should I store pomalidomide?** A:  Store pomalidomide as directed on the prescription label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions on missed doses.  Generally, if it's been less than 12 hours since your missed dose, you can take it.  If it's more than 12 hours, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule. Never double up on doses.
* **Q:  Can I drive or operate machinery while on pomalidomide?** A: Dizziness and fatigue are possible side effects, so you may need to adjust your activities accordingly.  Discuss with your doctor if you have concerns.
* **Q:  How long will I need to take pomalidomide?** A: The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on your response to the medication and your individual health situation. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.
