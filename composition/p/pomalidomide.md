# Pomalidomide

**Generic Name:** Pomalidomide

**Usage:** Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug used in the treatment of multiple myeloma.  Specifically, it's used in patients who have received at least two prior therapies, including lenalidomide and bortezomib.  It's often used in combination with other drugs, such as dexamethasone.  It may also be used in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received prior treatment with lenalidomide.  The specific usage and dosage are determined by a physician based on the patient's individual health status and response to treatment.


**Side Effects:**  Pomalidomide can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity.  Some common side effects include:

* **Low blood counts (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia):** This increases the risk of bleeding and infection.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stool.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or eruption.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.
* **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE):** Blood clots in the legs or lungs.
* **Second malignancies:** Increased risk of developing other cancers.
* **Hypertension:** High blood pressure.


**Serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Signs of infection (fever, chills, etc.)
* Severe bleeding
* Sudden shortness of breath or chest pain (possible PE)
* Severe abdominal pain


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary between individuals.  It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Pomalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug, meaning it affects the immune system. Its exact mechanism of action in multiple myeloma is not fully understood, but it's believed to work through several pathways:

* **Immune modulation:** It enhances the activity of immune cells, such as T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, to better target and destroy myeloma cells.
* **Direct anti-myeloma activity:** It may directly inhibit the growth and survival of myeloma cells.
* **Inhibition of angiogenesis:** It may reduce the formation of new blood vessels that nourish the myeloma tumors.
