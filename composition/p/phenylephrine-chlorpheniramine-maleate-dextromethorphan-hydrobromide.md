# Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is a decongestant, antihistamine, and cough suppressant used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory allergies.  Specifically:

* **Phenylephrine (Decongestant):** Shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate (Antihistamine):** Reduces allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (Cough Suppressant):** Reduces the urge to cough.

This medication is typically used for short-term relief of symptoms and is not a cure for the underlying illness.  It's generally recommended for adults and children above a certain age (check the specific product labeling), but is not suitable for everyone.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of both chlorpheniramine and dextromethorphan.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:** This is a common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Insomnia (difficulty sleeping):** Especially with higher doses or if taken late in the day.
* **Constipation:**
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with phenylephrine.
* **High blood pressure:** More likely with phenylephrine.

**Serious but less common side effects:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures
* Difficulty urinating


**How it Works:**

* **Phenylephrine:** Works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  This reduces symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
