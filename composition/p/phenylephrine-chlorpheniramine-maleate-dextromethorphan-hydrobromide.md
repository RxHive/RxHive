# Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

### Usage

This combination medication is a common over-the-counter (OTC) remedy for the symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory infections.  It addresses multiple symptoms simultaneously:

* **Phenylephrine:** This decongestant works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.  It provides relief from stuffy nose and sinus pressure.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that helps to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or colds. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a cough suppressant (antitussive). It works on the cough center in the brain to reduce the urge to cough, particularly effective for dry, non-productive coughs.  It's generally not recommended for coughs producing mucus.


This combination medication is primarily used for symptomatic relief; it does *not* treat the underlying cause of the illness (like a viral infection).


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation (e.g., tablet, liquid, capsule) and the manufacturer.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.**  Do not exceed the recommended dose.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you have questions or concerns.
