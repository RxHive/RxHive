# Promethazine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Promethazine with Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, such as cough and runny nose.  Promethazine is an antihistamine that helps to reduce runny nose and watery eyes. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps relieve a cough.  It's important to note that this combination is typically used for *non-productive* coughs (coughs that don't produce phlegm).  It's not generally recommended for coughs that produce mucus.  Always follow the prescribed dosage and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of both promethazine and dextromethorphan.  Avoid driving or operating machinery while taking this medication.
* **Dry mouth:** Drink plenty of water to alleviate this.
* **Constipation:** Increase fiber and water intake.
* **Nausea:**  If nausea is severe, contact your doctor.
* **Dizziness:** Avoid activities that require alertness.
* **Blurred vision:**  Seek medical attention if this persists.
* **Headache:** This usually subsides with continued use.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or other signs of an allergic reaction.
* **Slowed breathing:** This is particularly a concern in individuals with respiratory problems.
* **Confusion or hallucinations:** This is more common in older adults or those with pre-existing conditions.
* **Seizures:**  A rare but serious side effect.


**How it Works:**

* **Promethazine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens. This helps to reduce symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  It also has some sedative effects.
* **Dextromethorphan:** Works in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough, but it helps to reduce the frequency and intensity.
