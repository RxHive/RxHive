# Promethazine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Promethazine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide


### Usage
Promethazine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu.  It's primarily used to treat coughs (specifically, those that are non-productive, meaning they don't produce mucus) and associated symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  The promethazine component acts as an antihistamine, reducing allergy-like symptoms, while the dextromethorphan component is a cough suppressant.  This combination is not intended for treating a cough caused by a serious underlying condition, such as whooping cough or pneumonia.  It's crucial to consult a doctor if your cough persists or worsens, or if you experience other concerning symptoms.


### Dosage
Dosage for Promethazine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup, liquid), the manufacturer, and the age and weight of the patient.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist, and strictly adhere to the dosage indicated on the medication label.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**  

* **Adults:**  Typical adult dosages may range from one to two tablets or teaspoons (depending on the concentration) every 4 to 6 hours, as needed.  
* **Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower and carefully determined based on weight and age.  It is crucial to never administer adult-strength medication to a child.  Always consult a pediatrician or pharmacist for appropriate children's dosage.  
* **Oral Administration:**  This medication is typically taken orally.  For tablets, swallow them whole with a glass of water.  For liquid formulations, use a measuring device to ensure an accurate dose.  
* **IV Administration:**  This combination is not typically administered intravenously (IV). If your doctor prescribes it, it will be carefully monitored and administered in a hospital setting.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Constipation

* Blurred vision

Less common, but more serious side effects that require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe drowsiness or sedation
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures
* Hallucinations
* Confusion


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
Promethazine works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or cold/flu. By blocking histamine, it reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  Dextromethorphan works on the central nervous system to suppress the cough reflex.  It doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough, but it can reduce the frequency and intensity of coughing fits.  The combination of these two active ingredients addresses both the allergic and cough symptoms commonly associated with colds and the flu.
