# Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine
### Generic Name
Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and influenza (flu).  It addresses several symptoms simultaneously:

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). It works to reduce fever and alleviate mild to moderate pain associated with cold and flu, such as headache, muscle aches, and body aches.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It helps to relieve the runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes that are common cold and flu symptoms by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a decongestant. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. This helps to relieve stuffiness and improve breathing.

This combination medication is most effective when used at the onset of cold or flu symptoms.  It is primarily for symptom relief and does not cure the underlying viral infection.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary greatly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet strength, syrup concentration) and the age and weight of the patient.  **Always follow the directions provided on the product label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.**  Never exceed the recommended dose.

**General Guidance (Illustrative Only â€“ Always Refer to Product Labeling):**

* **Adults (typically 18 years and older):**  A typical dose might involve taking one or two tablets or a specific measured amount of syrup every 4-6 hours as needed, not to exceed a maximum daily dose.

* **Children:**  Dosage for children is strictly weight-based and significantly lower than adult doses.  **Never give adult formulations to children.**  There are specific pediatric formulations available. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before giving this medication to a child.

* **Oral Administration:** Tablets should be swallowed whole with water. Syrups should be measured using the provided measuring device.

* **IV Administration:** This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously.  Paracetamol, chlorpheniramine maleate, and pseudoephedrine are usually given orally.

### How it Works

As explained above, each component works through a different mechanism:

* **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever by affecting areas in the brain that regulate temperature. It also inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, thereby preventing histamine from causing symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages, causing constriction and reduction of swelling, thus relieving nasal congestion.
