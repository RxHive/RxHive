# Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Pseudoephedrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu, such as:

* **Fever:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever.
* **Headache:** Paracetamol and potentially the decongestant effects of pseudoephedrine can relieve headaches associated with cold and flu.
* **Body aches and pains:** Paracetamol relieves muscle aches and pains.
* **Runny nose:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps dry up a runny nose.
* **Congestion (nasal):** Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that helps relieve nasal congestion by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.  It can also help with sinus congestion.
* **Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine maleate can reduce sneezing.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is especially likely with chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth:**  Common with both chlorpheniramine maleate and pseudoephedrine.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by pseudoephedrine.
* **Headache:** Ironically, it can be a side effect, although it's intended to treat headaches.
* **Insomnia:** Pseudoephedrine can cause difficulty sleeping.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Constipation:** Less common but possible.
* **Increased heart rate and blood pressure:** More likely with pseudoephedrine, especially at higher doses.
* **Irritability:**  Possible with pseudoephedrine.
* **Anxiety:** Possible with pseudoephedrine.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness.


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates body temperature. It also has mild pain-relieving properties.  The exact mechanism of its pain-relieving action is not fully understood.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine contributes to runny nose, sneezing and watery eyes.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a decongestant. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and improving airflow.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of chlorpheniramine and increase the risk of drowsiness and dizziness. Avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

This is especially important for medications affecting the heart, blood pressure, or nervous system.
