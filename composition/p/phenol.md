# Phenol
### Generic Name
Phenol

### Usage
Phenol is a versatile medication with several applications. Its primary use is for the temporary relief of minor pain associated with sore throats, mouth sores, mouth irritation, canker sores, and teething pain.  It's also used as a first-aid antiseptic to help prevent infection in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.  A notable secondary use is in sclerotherapy for the treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoids, where it's injected to reduce hemorrhoid size.

### Dosage
Phenol dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation and the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions on your prescription label carefully.  Here's a summary, but this should not replace professional medical advice:

**For sore mouth/throat:**

* **Mouthwash/Gargle (1.4%):**  A small amount is gargled or swished for 15 seconds, then expectorated (spit out). Repeat every 2 hours as needed, up to a maximum of 12 times per day.  For sore throat, use for a maximum of 2 days; for sore mouth, a maximum of 7 days.
* **Spray (1.4%):** Spray 5 times directly onto the affected area, holding for 15 seconds before expectorating. Repeat every 2 hours as needed, for a maximum of 7 days.  Children aged 2-12 might require a lower dose or different application method.
* **Lozenges:**  Adults can use up to 2 lozenges every 2 hours as needed, allowing them to dissolve slowly in the mouth. Children's dosages vary with age.

**For Hemorrhoids (sclerotherapy):** This is administered as a local injection by a healthcare professional. The dosage is typically 2-5 mL of a 5% phenol solution (in a fixed oil vehicle) injected into the hemorrhoid.  The maximum dose per treatment session is 10 mL.

**For Antisepsis (Topical):** A 1.5% solution is applied sparingly to the affected area one to three times daily. Do not use for longer than 7 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and vary greatly based on age and the specific formulation used.  Always follow the instructions provided by your child's doctor or pharmacist.  The use of phenol injections is contraindicated in neonates and young children.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Mouth: Numbness, swelling, or irritation of the cheeks, lips, tongue, and mouth.
* General: Fever, nausea, vomiting.
* Topical application: Blanching, corrosion, pain, staining.
* Injection: Pain, discomfort at the injection site.

Less common but more serious side effects, especially with injection, may include: shortness of breath, chest tightness, allergic reactions (hives, rash), local ulceration, abscess formation, tissue necrosis, nerve damage, and in rare cases, more severe systemic complications.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.


### How it Works
Phenol acts as an antiseptic by disrupting the cell membranes and proteins of bacteria, preventing their growth and killing them. As an anesthetic, it reduces pain by decreasing nerve impulses in the affected area. In the treatment of hemorrhoids, its corrosive properties cause fibrosis (scarring) that helps to reduce hemorrhoid size.


### Precautions
* **Allergy:** Do not use phenol if you are allergic to it or any of its components.
* **Large areas:** Avoid applying topical phenol to large areas of skin.
* **Wounds:** Do not use phenol on deep wounds, animal bites, or severe burns.
* **Eyes:** Avoid contact with eyes.
* **Children:** Carefully follow pediatric dosage instructions. Injection is contraindicated in neonates and young children.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding; discuss with your doctor.
* **Drug interactions:** Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking.
* **Injection site selection:**  For hemorrhoid injections, proper injection technique is crucial to avoid serious side effects.
