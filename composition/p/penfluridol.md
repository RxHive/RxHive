# Penfluridol

**Generic Name:** Penfluridol

**Usage:**

Penfluridol is an antipsychotic medication used primarily to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  It's typically used for long-term maintenance therapy in patients who have responded well to initial treatment with other antipsychotics.  Due to its long half-life, it's often administered less frequently than other antipsychotics (e.g., once a month).  It is *not* a first-line treatment for acute psychotic episodes and is usually reserved for patients who require long-term management and have demonstrated tolerance to other options.  Off-label uses exist, but should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**

Penfluridol, like other antipsychotics, can cause a range of side effects, including:

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):** These include Parkinsonism (rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia), akathisia (restlessness), dystonia (muscle spasms), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, often of the face and mouth â€“ this is potentially irreversible).
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability.
* **Anticholinergic effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention.
* **Sedation:** Drowsiness and fatigue.
* **Weight gain:** Significant weight increase can occur.
* **Cardiovascular effects:** Changes in heart rate and blood pressure.
* **Endocrine effects:**  Increased prolactin levels (can lead to galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia).
* **Metabolic effects:** Increased blood sugar and cholesterol levels.
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight.


**How it Works:**

Penfluridol is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter implicated in the development of psychosis. By reducing dopamine activity in the brain, penfluridol helps alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.  The precise mechanism of its long-acting effect isn't fully understood, but it likely involves its depot formulation and its slow release from the injection site.


**FAQs:**

* **Is penfluridol habit-forming?**  Penfluridol is not considered habit-forming in the same way as opioids or stimulants. However, dependence can develop in the sense that abrupt cessation after long-term use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Discontinuation should always be done under strict medical supervision.

* **How often is penfluridol administered?** Penfluridol is usually administered as a long-acting intramuscular injection, typically once a month.  The frequency may be adjusted based on individual response and clinical needs.

* **What are the risks of long-term penfluridol use?** Long-term use increases the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and other significant side effects mentioned above. Regular monitoring is crucial.

* **Is penfluridol suitable for everyone with schizophrenia?** No. It's not a first-line treatment and is generally reserved for patients who have failed to respond adequately to other antipsychotics and require long-term maintenance therapy.  It is unsuitable for patients with certain medical conditions, such as severe liver or kidney disease.

* **Can I stop taking penfluridol suddenly?** No. Abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms and potentially serious complications.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.
