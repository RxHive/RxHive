# Penfluridol
### Generic Name
Penfluridol

### Usage
Penfluridol is a potent antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  Its powerful effect on dopamine receptors makes it effective in managing symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking associated with these conditions. While its primary use is in managing psychotic symptoms, it's important to note that penfluridol is not typically a first-line treatment due to its potential side effects and the availability of newer antipsychotics with potentially improved side effect profiles.  Its use is generally reserved for cases where other treatments have proven ineffective or intolerable.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (for psychosis):** Penfluridol is usually administered orally. The starting dose is typically 20-60 mg once a week.  For individuals with severe or treatment-resistant psychosis, the dose may be gradually increased, but it shouldn't exceed 250 mg per week.  This is under close medical supervision and careful monitoring for side effects.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of penfluridol in children have not been established, and it is therefore not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, close monitoring is necessary in these patients because drug metabolism and clearance could be affected, potentially requiring dose modification under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Penfluridol, like other antipsychotics, can cause a range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity.  Some common side effects include:

* **Nervous System:** Agitation, anxiety, depression, seizures (especially in those with a low seizure threshold), emotional changes.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting.
* **Endocrine & Metabolic:** Weight gain, increased saliva production, changes in blood sugar levels.
* **Genitourinary:**  Increased risk of breast cancer (in women), menstrual irregularities, urinary retention.
* **Respiratory:** Worsening of asthma.
* **Liver:** Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).
* **Other:** Skin rash, low blood pressure (hypotension), movement disorders (extrapyramidal symptoms).

**Serious but less common side effects:**  Penfluridol can potentially cause life-threatening complications, including blood dyscrasias (disorders of blood cells), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS â€“ a severe, potentially fatal reaction), QT prolongation (abnormality in the heart's electrical activity increasing risk of fatal arrhythmias), and other serious cardiovascular events.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Penfluridol is a dopamine receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  In schizophrenia, an imbalance of dopamine is thought to play a significant role. By blocking dopamine receptors, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway, penfluridol helps to reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions.  It also affects the release of certain hypothalamic and pituitary hormones.  The precise mechanism of its effects on negative symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., flattened affect, social withdrawal) is less fully understood.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Penfluridol is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to penfluridol or other antipsychotic drugs, as well as those with severe CNS depression or coma.
* **Warnings:**  Use with extreme caution in elderly patients, those with epilepsy, pre-existing cardiac conduction disorders, hypokalemia (low potassium), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
* **Drug Interactions:** Penfluridol can interact with numerous other medications.  These interactions may enhance or diminish the effects of penfluridol or other drugs, potentially leading to adverse events.  Particular attention should be paid to interactions with MAOIs, hypnotics, antihistamines, opiates, antacids (aluminum-containing), TCAs, bromocriptine, amphetamines, levodopa, metoclopramide, phenytoin, type 1a antiarrhythmics, certain quinolone antibiotics, trazodone, valproic acid, and lithium. Always inform your doctor of all medications (prescription and over-the-counter), herbal supplements, and other substances you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Penfluridol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is unknown.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking penfluridol because it is excreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking penfluridol?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided as it can worsen the side effects of penfluridol, particularly drowsiness and sedation.

* **Q: Can I stop taking penfluridol suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping penfluridol.  Sudden cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Dosage should be reduced gradually under medical supervision.

* **Q: How should I store penfluridol?** A: Store penfluridol as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q:  Is penfluridol addictive?** A:  Physical dependence is uncommon, but psychological dependence can occur, so always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and cessation.
