# Phenylpropanolamine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Phenylpropanolamine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Paracetamol (This combination is rarely found as a single fixed-dose combination product anymore, and formulations may vary significantly.  Information below is general and reflects the individual components.)

**Usage:**  This combination of drugs was historically used as a multi-symptom cold and flu remedy.  Each ingredient targets a specific symptom:

* **Phenylpropanolamine (PPA):**  A decongestant (primarily nasal).  **NOTE:** PPA is largely removed from the market in many countries due to safety concerns.  This combination is likely obsolete.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, used to relieve runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive).
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A pain reliever and fever reducer.

Therefore, the combined effect was intended to address congestion, runny nose, sneezing, cough, pain, and fever associated with the common cold or flu.

**Side Effects:** Side effects vary depending on the specific drug and individual sensitivity.  Possible side effects include:

* **Phenylpropanolamine (PPA):**  Increased blood pressure, insomnia, nervousness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and potentially serious cardiovascular effects (this is a major reason for its removal from many markets).
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, constipation.  At high doses, it can have hallucinogenic effects.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Liver damage (with overdose), allergic reactions (rare).

**How it Works:**

* **Phenylpropanolamine (PPA):**  Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing allergy symptoms.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates temperature. It also reduces pain by interfering with the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that sensitize nerve endings to pain.

**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination still available?**  Likely not as a single fixed-dose combination in most countries due to the removal of PPA from many markets.  Individual components are readily available in separate formulations.
* **Is this combination safe?**  Given the removal of PPA, the safety profile is improved, but potential side effects of the remaining ingredients should be considered.  Always consult a doctor before taking any medication.
* **Can I take this with other medications?**  Interactions with other drugs are possible.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
* **What should I do if I overdose?**  Seek immediate medical attention.  Paracetamol overdose is particularly dangerous.
* **What are the alternatives?**  Many over-the-counter cold and flu remedies are available with different combinations of active ingredients that address the symptoms individually.
