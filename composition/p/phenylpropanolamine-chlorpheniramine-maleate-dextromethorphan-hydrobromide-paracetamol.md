# Phenylpropanolamine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Paracetamol
### Generic Name
Phenylpropanolamine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Paracetamol

**Note:**  This combination is not commonly available as a single, fixed-dose generic product in many regions.  The ingredients are often found in various over-the-counter (OTC) combination cold and flu remedies, but the specific proportions and inclusion of phenylpropanolamine vary.  It's crucial to check the specific product labeling for accurate information on ingredients and dosage.  *Phenylpropanolamine's use has been restricted or banned in several countries due to safety concerns, so its inclusion in this combination is noteworthy.*  This information is for general knowledge and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use. Always consult a healthcare professional before taking any medication.

### Usage

This combination medication typically targets symptoms of the common cold and flu. Let's break down the individual components and their roles:

* **Phenylpropanolamine (PPA):**  *Note: PPA's use is controversial and restricted in many places due to links to stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events.*  Where still available, it acts as a decongestant, reducing nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or the common cold.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (DXM):** A cough suppressant, DXM works on the brain to reduce the urge to cough.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). It helps alleviate headaches, muscle aches, and fever.


This combination medication is primarily used for symptomatic relief of cold and flu symptoms and is not a cure.


### Dosage

Because this combination is not standardized and available in various forms and strengths across different brands, a precise dosage cannot be given here. **Always refer to the specific product label for the correct dosage instructions.** The label will indicate the appropriate dosage for adults and children based on age and weight.  Oral administration is typical for this type of combination medication.  There is no IV formulation for this specific combination.  The dosage of each component will vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific formulation.

### How it Works

The medication works through a combination of mechanisms:

* **PPA:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing allergy and cold symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
* **DXM:** Acts on the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever by affecting the areas in the brain that regulate temperature and blocks pain signals.

The combination aims to alleviate various symptoms associated with colds and flu.
