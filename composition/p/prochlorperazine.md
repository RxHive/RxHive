# Prochlorperazine

**Generic Name:** Prochlorperazine

**Usage:** Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic (prevents nausea and vomiting) and antipsychotic medication.  It's primarily used to:

* **Treat nausea and vomiting:**  This includes nausea and vomiting caused by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other medical conditions.
* **Treat severe nausea and vomiting:**  It can be used for more severe cases where other antiemetics haven't been effective.
* **Control severe psychotic disorders:**  Though less common now, it can be used to manage symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, particularly when other medications haven't worked.
* **Short-term control of anxiety and agitation:** In limited cases, and usually as a short-term solution in a hospital setting, it might be used to manage significant anxiety or agitation.


**Side Effects:** Prochlorperazine can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and restlessness.
* **Less Common but Important:**  Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as muscle stiffness, tremors, uncontrolled movements (tardive dyskinesia – a potentially irreversible condition),  restlessness (akathisia), and dystonia (muscle spasms).  These are more common with higher doses and longer duration of use.
* **Serious (requires immediate medical attention):**  Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), low white blood cell count (agranulocytosis), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) – a life-threatening condition involving high fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status.


**How it Works:** Prochlorperazine works primarily by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating several brain functions, including movement, mood, and the vomiting reflex. By blocking dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine can reduce nausea and vomiting, as well as reduce some of the symptoms of psychosis.  The exact mechanism for its anti-anxiety effects is less clear but likely involves interactions with other neurotransmitter systems.


**FAQs:**

* **Is prochlorperazine habit-forming?**  It's not physically addictive in the same way as opioids, but tolerance can develop, meaning higher doses may be needed over time to achieve the same effect.  Psychological dependence is possible, especially with long-term use for psychotic disorders.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking prochlorperazine?**  No. Alcohol can worsen the drowsiness and dizziness caused by prochlorperazine.
* **Can I drive while taking prochlorperazine?**  It's advisable to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you, as drowsiness is a common side effect.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **What are the long-term effects of prochlorperazine?** Long-term use increases the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia, a potentially irreversible movement disorder.  Regular monitoring is crucial with long-term use.
* **Can prochlorperazine be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  It should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Consult your doctor immediately.
