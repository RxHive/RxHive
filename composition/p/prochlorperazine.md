# Prochlorperazine
### Generic Name
Prochlorperazine

### Usage

Prochlorperazine is primarily used to treat severe nausea and vomiting.  This includes nausea and vomiting caused by various reasons, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and other medical conditions. It's also used in the management of schizophrenia, a serious mental illness.  While it has been used off-label for conditions like migraine and vertigo,  its effectiveness and safety in these uses are not as well-established as its use for nausea and vomiting or schizophrenia.  It's important to note that prochlorperazine is *not* effective in managing behavioral problems in individuals with intellectual disability.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, intravenous, rectal).  **It is crucial to follow the prescribing healthcare professional's instructions precisely.**  The information below is for general knowledge only and should not be interpreted as a substitute for personalized medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Nausea/Vomiting:** Oral dosages typically range from 5-10 mg three to four times daily, with a maximum daily dose of 40 mg.  Higher doses may be used in some cases. Intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) administration are also possible, with dosages similarly adjusted based on severity and response. Rectal suppositories may be used as well.
* **Schizophrenia:** Oral dosages are usually started lower and gradually increased, potentially reaching 100-150 mg per day in severe cases.  IM injections can be used initially for rapid symptom control.
* **Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting:** Dosages are adjusted based on the emetogenicity (vomiting-inducing potential) of the chemotherapy regimen, with higher doses and more frequent administration used for highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

**Children:** Prochlorperazine use in children under 2 years of age is generally not recommended. Dosages for older children are determined by weight and the condition being treated, often expressed in mg/kg.  Again, precise instructions from a physician are essential.

**Dosage forms:** Prochlorperazine is available in tablets, syrups, suppositories, and injectable solutions (for IM and IV use).


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Restlessness
* Tremors

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):  A life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.  Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur.
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS): These include muscle stiffness, tremors, involuntary movements, and other movement disorders.
* Blood disorders (e.g., agranulocytosis):  A decrease in white blood cells, which can increase the risk of infection. Regular blood monitoring may be necessary.
* Jaundice: Yellowing of the skin and eyes, indicative of liver problems.
* Hypotension: Low blood pressure.
* Cardiac effects:  Rarely, serious heart rhythm disturbances.


**If any side effects occur, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Prochlorperazine is a phenothiazine derivative and an antipsychotic medication.  It primarily works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. This action helps to reduce nausea and vomiting by affecting the area of the brain that controls the vomiting reflex (the chemoreceptor trigger zone).  In schizophrenia, it helps to regulate dopamine activity, which is believed to be imbalanced in this condition.  Prochlorperazine also has other effects on the nervous system, contributing to its antiemetic and antipsychotic actions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Prochlorperazine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to phenothiazines, coma, severe cardiovascular disease, and certain other conditions.  Its use in children under 2 is generally avoided.  It should not be used for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis in the elderly.
* **Drug interactions:** Prochlorperazine can interact with many other medications, including alcohol, other CNS depressants, and certain antihistamines.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Prochlorperazine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Elderly patients:**  Use in elderly patients should be approached with particular caution due to the increased risk of falls, cardiovascular events, and other adverse effects.
* **Patients with liver or kidney disease:**  Dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking prochlorperazine?** A: Drowsiness and dizziness are common side effects, so avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Q: How should I store prochlorperazine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature away from light and moisture.
