# Potassium Magnesium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Potassium Magnesium Citrate

**Usage:**

Potassium Magnesium Citrate is primarily used as a laxative to treat occasional constipation. It works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and stimulating bowel movements.  It's often used for bowel preparation before medical procedures like colonoscopies.  It *is not* intended for regular use as a daily laxative.  Note that specific dosage and frequency will always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary based on individual needs and the reason for use.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Abdominal cramping
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Gas
* Rectal discomfort

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur, especially with overuse or in individuals with underlying health conditions.  These may include:

* Dehydration (due to diarrhea)
* Electrolyte imbalances (potassium and magnesium levels can become dangerously high or low)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Muscle weakness
* Kidney problems


**How it Works:**

Potassium Magnesium Citrate is a combination of potassium citrate and magnesium citrate. Both salts are osmotic laxatives.  They work by increasing the amount of water in the intestines.  This softens the stool and increases the frequency of bowel movements. The increased water content also stimulates bowel contractions, helping to move the stool through the intestines more easily.
