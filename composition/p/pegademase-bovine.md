# Pegademase (Bovine)
### Generic Name
Pegademase (Bovine)

### Usage
Pegademase (bovine) is a medication used in enzyme replacement therapy. Its primary use is in treating severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in infants and children.  This therapy is indicated when bone marrow transplantation is unsuitable or has failed. It's crucial to understand that Pegademase (bovine) is not a cure for SCID and requires ongoing administration.  This treatment aims to correct the metabolic abnormalities caused by ADA deficiency, leading to improvements in immune function and a reduction in opportunistic infections.


### Dosage
Pegademase (bovine) is not approved for use in adults.  Dosage for infants and children is individualized based on laboratory values (ADA activity, erythrocyte dATP concentration, and total ATP) and clinical response.  It's administered intramuscularly (IM).

**Initial Therapy (Infants, Children, and Adolescents):**

* **Dose 1:** 10 units/kg IM
* **Dose 2 (7 days after Dose 1):** 15 units/kg IM
* **Dose 3 (7 days after Dose 2):** 20 units/kg IM

Following the initial doses, maintenance therapy begins.

**Maintenance Therapy (Infants, Children, and Adolescents):**

* **Dose:**  Typically 20 units/kg/week, administered once weekly.  
* **Dose Adjustment:** The dose may be increased by 5 units/kg/week if needed to maintain plasma ADA activity (trough) between 15-35 micromoles/h/mL and a decrease in erythrocyte dATP to ≤0.005 to 0.015 micromoles/mL, or ≤1% of total erythrocyte adenine nucleotide (ATP + dATP) content.
* **Maximum Single Dose:** 30 units/kg/dose.

**Important Note:**  Close medical supervision and appropriate diagnostic tests and therapy for intercurrent illnesses (e.g., antibiotics, nutrition, oxygen, and gammaglobulin) must continue even with Pegademase (bovine) treatment.  The optimal long-term dose and schedule should be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual patient response and laboratory monitoring.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer’s labeling.


### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

* Antibody development


**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
* Erythema at the injection site
* Headache
* Hemolytic anemia
* Immune thrombocytopenia
* Malignant lymphoma
* Pain at the injection site
* Thrombocythemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Urticaria

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Pegademase (bovine) is a modified form of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA).  In ADA deficiency, the body lacks sufficient ADA, leading to a buildup of toxic substances. Pegademase (bovine) acts as a replacement enzyme, catalyzing the deamination of adenosine and deoxyadenosine. This corrects the metabolic abnormalities caused by ADA deficiency. The improved metabolic function then leads to better immune function and a decrease in the frequency of opportunistic infections associated with ADA-SCID.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Use as preparatory or support therapy for bone marrow transplantation.
* Severe thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of antibody formation and infection.

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with thrombocytopenia.
* In breastfeeding women.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* Pegademase (bovine) is Pregnancy Category C; it should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

**Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with pegloticase or pentostatin is not recommended due to potential interactions that may reduce the effectiveness of either drug.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is Pegademase (bovine) a cure for SCID?**  A: No, it's an enzyme replacement therapy that helps manage the condition but does not cure it.  Continued treatment is essential.

* **Q: How is Pegademase (bovine) administered?** A: It's administered intramuscularly (IM).  Do not administer intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SubQ), and do not dilute or mix it with other medications.

* **Q:  How is the treatment monitored?** A: Regular monitoring of plasma ADA activity, red cell dATP levels, and immune function is crucial to determine the effectiveness of treatment and adjust the dosage accordingly.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

* **Q: Is Pegademase (bovine) suitable for adults?** A: No, it's currently not indicated for adult use.

* **Q: How should Pegademase (bovine) be stored?**  A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label.
