# Procarbazine

**Generic Name:** Procarbazine

**Usage:** Procarbazine is an antineoplastic (anticancer) medication used primarily in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma.  It's often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs.  It may also be used in the treatment of certain types of brain tumors.  The specific use and dosage are determined by a physician based on the individual's condition and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:** Procarbazine has a wide range of potential side effects, some common and others rare but potentially serious.  These can include:

* **Common:** Nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, dizziness, constipation, diarrhea, mouth sores (stomatitis), hair loss (alopecia), skin rash.
* **Serious:**  Myelosuppression (decreased bone marrow function leading to low blood cell counts - anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia),  pulmonary toxicity (lung damage),  neurological effects (including peripheral neuropathy, seizures),  hepatotoxicity (liver damage),  cardiotoxicity (heart damage),  secondary malignancies (increased risk of developing other cancers), infertility (both in men and women).  Allergic reactions are also possible.

**It is crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary significantly between individuals.**  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.


**How it Works:** Procarbazine is an alkylating agent.  It works by damaging the DNA of rapidly dividing cancer cells, preventing their replication and ultimately leading to their death. The exact mechanism is complex and involves multiple pathways of DNA damage.
