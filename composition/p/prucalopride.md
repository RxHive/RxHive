# Prucalopride

**Generic Name:** Prucalopride

**Usage:**

Prucalopride is used to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults.  It's a selective serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist, meaning it works by stimulating the serotonin 5-HT4 receptors in the gut.  This increases gut motility (the movement of food through the digestive tract), leading to easier bowel movements.  It is generally considered for patients who haven't responded adequately to other treatments.

**Side Effects:**

The most common side effects of prucalopride are related to the gastrointestinal tract and include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is often the most prominent side effect and can be severe in some individuals.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Abdominal pain:**  Pain or discomfort in the stomach area.
* **Vomiting:** Throwing up.
* **Headache:**  Pain in the head.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Severe diarrhea leading to dehydration:** This requires medical attention.
* **Allergic reactions:** such as rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):** Though rare, this is a potential concern, particularly in those with pre-existing heart conditions.


**How it Works:**

Prucalopride primarily works by selectively activating serotonin 5-HT4 receptors located in the gut.  This activation triggers a cascade of events that accelerates intestinal transit.  It increases the frequency and strength of colonic contractions, propelling stool more efficiently through the colon and facilitating bowel movements.  Importantly, it doesn't affect the overall consistency of the stool.
