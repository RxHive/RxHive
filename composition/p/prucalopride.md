# Prucalopride
### Generic Name
Prucalopride

### Usage
Prucalopride is primarily used to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults.  This means it's prescribed for people who experience persistent constipation without any identifiable underlying medical cause.  It works by increasing the movement of the bowels.  While not its primary indication, it may also be considered as a treatment option for other forms of constipation in certain situations, but this should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical dose for chronic idiopathic constipation is 2 mg once daily (OD) taken orally. If a bowel movement doesn't occur for three or more consecutive days, a healthcare professional may consider adding a laxative to the treatment plan.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of prucalopride in children have not been established, so it is not recommended for use in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):** No dosage adjustment is usually necessary according to current prescribing information.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  For patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment (creatinine clearance â‰¥30 mL/min), no adjustment is needed.  However, for those with severe kidney impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the dose should be reduced to 1 mg once daily.  Prucalopride should be avoided in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis.

### How it Works

Prucalopride is a selective serotonin 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist.  This means it binds to and activates specific receptors in the gastrointestinal tract.  Activation of these receptors stimulates the movement of the colon (large intestine), specifically increasing high-amplitude propagating contractions. This enhanced colonic motility leads to increased bowel movements and helps relieve constipation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Prucalopride should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to prucalopride or any of its ingredients; those with intestinal perforation or obstruction;  obstructive ileus; severe inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or toxic megacolon/megarectum); and patients with severe kidney impairment requiring dialysis.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Prucalopride can interact with certain medications.  For example, anticholinergic agents may decrease its effectiveness, while some other drugs (e.g., fosfomycin, sirolimus) may have altered levels in the presence of prucalopride. It is essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of prucalopride during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant. Consider using contraception during treatment.
* **Specific Populations:**  Prucalopride should be used cautiously in elderly patients and those with kidney impairment.
