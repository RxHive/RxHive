# Pseudoephedrine + Terfenadine
Please note:  A combination of pseudoephedrine and terfenadine is **not** a currently prescribed or recommended medication.  Terfenadine has been withdrawn from the market in many countries due to serious cardiac risks, particularly when combined with certain other drugs.  The information below is provided for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as an endorsement or recommendation for use.  **Never take terfenadine without explicit instruction from a doctor.**


### Generic Name:  Pseudoephedrine + Terfenadine (Combination No Longer Available)

This section details the individual components, as the combination is obsolete.

### Usage (Individual Components)

* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a sympathomimetic amine used primarily as a decongestant. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and relieving stuffiness associated with the common cold, sinusitis, and other upper respiratory allergies.  It can also be found in some combination medications for cold and flu symptoms.

* **Terfenadine (withdrawn):** This was a non-sedating antihistamine previously used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives). It blocked the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions.  However, due to its potential to cause serious heart rhythm problems (torsades de pointes) particularly when combined with certain medications that affect the cytochrome P450 system, it has been withdrawn from the market in most countries.

### Dosage (Individual Components - Obsolete Combination)

**Because this combination is no longer available, dosage information is irrelevant and potentially dangerous to provide.**  Never attempt to self-prescribe a combination of pseudoephedrine and terfenadine.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** Dosage varies widely based on the specific formulation and the indication.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a physician.  Common dosages range from 30mg to 120mg every 4-6 hours, but this is not an exhaustive list.

* **Terfenadine (withdrawn):**  Dosage information is provided only for historical context. The recommended dosage for terfenadine varied based on the specific formulation and the condition being treated.  **Do not attempt to obtain or use terfenadine.**


### Side Effects (Individual Components)

* **Pseudoephedrine:** Common side effects include nervousness, insomnia, dizziness, headache, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure.  Less common but more serious effects include chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and stroke.

* **Terfenadine (withdrawn):**  The most serious side effect was a potentially fatal irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes), particularly when combined with other medications, like certain antifungals and antibiotics, that inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Other side effects included drowsiness, nausea, and constipation.


### How it Works (Individual Components)

* **Pseudoephedrine:**  It acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This reduces swelling in the nasal passages and improves airflow.

* **Terfenadine (withdrawn):**  It competitively blocks histamine receptors (H1 receptors) on cells, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic responses.  This reduced symptoms like itching, sneezing, and runny nose.


### Precautions (Individual Components)

* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Avoid use in individuals with high blood pressure, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes. It should be used cautiously in individuals with prostate problems.  It can interact with certain medications.

* **Terfenadine (withdrawn):**  **Terfenadine should never be used.** Its serious cardiac side effects, particularly when combined with drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, outweigh any potential benefits.
