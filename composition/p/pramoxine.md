# Pramoxine
### Generic Name
Pramoxine

### Usage

Pramoxine is a topical anesthetic used to temporarily relieve pain and itching.  Its primary use is for the symptomatic treatment of minor skin irritations such as hemorrhoids, burns, minor cuts, scrapes, and other sources of localized discomfort.  While not its primary indication, it can also provide temporary relief from itching associated with various skin conditions.  It's important to remember that pramoxine only addresses the symptoms and does not treat the underlying cause of the irritation or itching.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (cream, lotion, ointment, foam, wipes) and the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.  Generally:

* **Adults and Children ≥12 years (Hemorrhoidal itching):** For products like 1% foam, ointment, or wipes, apply to the affected area up to five times daily.
* **Adults and Children ≥2 years (Minor skin irritation):** For 1% lotions or creams, apply to the affected area up to three or four times daily.

**Children under 2 years:** Pramoxine use should be under strict medical supervision.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage information for this age group.

**Important Note:**  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.  Always use the lowest effective dose.  If symptoms persist or worsen after 7 days, consult a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Contact dermatitis
* Irritation
* Eczema
* Itching (pruritus) at the application site

Serious side effects are rare but may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or severe reactions.


### How it Works

Pramoxine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve impulses in the treated area.  It does this by decreasing the permeability of neuronal membranes to sodium ions, preventing the transmission of pain and itch signals to the brain.  This results in temporary numbness and relief from pain and itching.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use pramoxine if you are allergic or hypersensitive to it or any of its components.
* **Interactions:** The effects of pramoxine might be increased by agents associated with methemoglobinemia (a condition affecting red blood cells).  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of pramoxine during pregnancy is not fully established.  It's advisable to consult a healthcare professional before using it during pregnancy.  Pramoxine may be excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is generally discouraged while using this medication.
* **Children and Older Adults:** Use with caution in young children and older adults.  Follow the recommended dosage carefully and monitor for any adverse reactions.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes and open wounds.  For creams, avoid use around the eyes. For ointments and foams, do not insert into the rectum. Use lotions sparingly.
