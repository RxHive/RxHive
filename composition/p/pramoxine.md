# Pramoxine

**Generic Name:** Pramoxine

**Usage:**

Pramoxine is a topical anesthetic used to relieve itching and pain associated with minor skin irritations.  These irritations can include:

* Minor burns
* Sunburn
* Insect bites
* Cuts
* Scrapes
* Rashes
* Anal itching (hemorrhoids)
* Vaginal itching (vulvovaginitis)


It is important to note that pramoxine is a temporary relief measure and does not treat the underlying cause of the irritation.  If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a doctor.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.


**Side Effects:**

Pramoxine is generally well-tolerated, but some people may experience side effects, including:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site (this is often temporary)
* Redness
* Swelling
* Irritation
* Allergic reactions (rare, but can include rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.)


**How it Works:**

Pramoxine is a local anesthetic that works by temporarily numbing the nerve endings in the skin. This reduces the sensation of pain and itching.  It doesn't treat the underlying condition but simply masks the symptoms.
