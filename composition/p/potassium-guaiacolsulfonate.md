# Potassium Guaiacolsulfonate
### Generic Name
Potassium Guaiacolsulfonate

### Usage

Potassium guaiacolsulfonate is an expectorant, a type of medicine that helps loosen and thin mucus in the lungs and airways.  It's primarily used to treat coughs and chest congestion associated with various respiratory illnesses. These include the common cold, bronchitis, sinusitis, and pharyngitis.  It's often used in combination with other medications, such as guaifenesin, to enhance its effectiveness.  It is important to note that the effectiveness of potassium guaiacolsulfonate as a standalone expectorant has been questioned, and its use is often part of a broader treatment plan.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions for potassium guaiacolsulfonate vary greatly depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the manufacturer, and the accompanying medications.  **Therefore, it is crucial to follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist precisely.**  There isn't a universally applicable adult or child dosage as it's rarely prescribed as a sole agent.  The medication is often found as a component in combination cough and cold remedies.  Always check the product label for specific instructions and never exceed the recommended dose.

### Side Effects

Common side effects associated with potassium guaiacolsulfonate are generally mild and infrequent when used as part of a multi-ingredient product. However, it's crucial to be aware that side effects can vary depending on the individual and other medications taken. Potential side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach upset
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

Serious side effects are rare.  If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or a severe allergic reaction, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Potassium guaiacolsulfonate works by reducing the stickiness of mucus in the respiratory tract.  This makes it easier to expel the mucus through coughing, thereby relieving chest congestion. The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to affect the properties of the mucus, making it less viscous.  It does not directly suppress the cough reflex.
