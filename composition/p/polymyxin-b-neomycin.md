# Polymyxin B + Neomycin

**Generic Name:** Polymyxin B Sulfate + Neomycin Sulfate

**Usage:**

Polymyxin B + Neomycin is a topical antibiotic combination used to treat various bacterial skin infections, including:

* Minor burns
* Abrasions
* Cuts
* Skin ulcers
* Infected dermatoses (skin conditions)

It's important to note that this combination is only for external use and should never be ingested or used in the eyes.  The specific formulation and indication might vary slightly depending on the brand name and country of origin.  Always consult the product label for specific usage instructions.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  These can include:

* Burning
* Stinging
* Itching
* Redness
* Irritation

* Skin rash

Less common, but more serious, side effects are possible, though rare with topical application. These include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, though extremely rare)
*  Contact dermatitis
*  Hypersensitivity


**How it Works:**

Polymyxin B and Neomycin are both antibiotics that work in different ways to kill bacteria:

* **Polymyxin B:** This is a polypeptide antibiotic that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death.  It's effective against Gram-negative bacteria.

* **Neomycin:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, also leading to cell death. It's effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

The combination of these two antibiotics provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria commonly causing skin infections.
