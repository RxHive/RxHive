# Polymyxin B + Neomycin
### Generic Name
Polymyxin B + Neomycin

### Usage

Polymyxin B and Neomycin is a combination antibiotic ointment used primarily to treat superficial bacterial skin infections.  It's effective against a range of Gram-negative bacteria (like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Escherichia coli*) and some Gram-positive bacteria. This combination is often used for minor wounds, burns, cuts, abrasions, and skin ulcers to prevent or treat infection. While it's primarily a topical treatment, it’s crucial to understand this combination isn't suitable for all infections and should only be used for superficial skin issues.  It’s not effective against viral or fungal infections.  It should not be used for deep wounds or serious infections requiring systemic antibiotics.

### Dosage

**Topical Use Only:**  This medication is applied directly to the affected skin area.  There is no standardized dosage across all brands, so always follow the instructions on your specific product packaging.  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the cleaned and dried affected area two to four times daily, or as directed by a healthcare professional.

* **Adults and Children:**  The dosage is determined by the size of the affected area.  Application should be limited to the infected skin; avoid contact with the eyes or mucous membranes.

* **Specific Administration Guidelines:** Clean the affected area thoroughly before application.  Apply a thin layer and avoid covering the area with an airtight bandage unless specifically instructed by a doctor.  Overuse can potentially lead to increased risk of irritation.

**This medication is not available in oral or IV forms.**

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Burning, stinging, itching, or redness at the application site.  These are usually mild and temporary.

* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  These are rare but require immediate medical attention.  Contact dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) may also occur.  Prolonged use can potentially lead to skin thinning and increased risk of infection from other organisms.


* **Important Note:** If you experience any unusual symptoms or worsening of the infection, stop using the ointment and seek medical advice.

### How it Works

Polymyxin B and Neomycin work by targeting bacterial cell membranes. Polymyxin B disrupts the bacterial cell membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, leading to cell death. Neomycin interferes with protein synthesis within the bacterial cell, preventing bacterial growth and reproduction.  By combining these two antibiotics, the ointment broadens its spectrum of activity, increasing its effectiveness against a wider range of bacteria responsible for skin infections.

### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Do not use this ointment if you are allergic to polymyxin B, neomycin, or any other components of the product.  Prior allergy to aminoglycosides (a class of antibiotics including neomycin) increases the risk of a reaction.

* **Drug Interactions:** Though generally minor, interactions with other medications are possible, especially topical medications. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, you are using.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered after careful assessment of the benefits versus potential risks by a healthcare professional.  Topical application generally poses less risk than systemic administration, but it's crucial to exercise caution.

* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Individuals with impaired kidney function should use this medication with caution, as neomycin can be nephrotoxic (harmful to the kidneys) if absorbed systemically in significant amounts.  While topical use minimizes this risk, the potential remains.

* **Children:**  Use in children should follow the guidance of a pediatrician.

* **Long-term use:** Avoid prolonged or extensive use without consulting a healthcare professional.  Prolonged use increases the risk of resistance development and other adverse effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this ointment on my face?** A:  While it *can* be used on the face, it’s generally advisable to avoid applying it near the eyes or mucous membranes. If facial application is necessary, consult your doctor first.

* **Q: How long should I use this ointment?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and your response to the medication. Generally, improvement should be seen within a few days.  If no improvement is observed after 7-10 days, seek medical advice.

* **Q: Can I use this ointment on open wounds?** A:  This ointment can be used on minor, superficial wounds to prevent infection.  However, for deep or severely infected wounds, consult a doctor, as systemic antibiotics may be necessary.

* **Q: How should I store this ointment?** A:  Store the ointment at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
