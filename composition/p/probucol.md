# Probucol
### Generic Name
Probucol

### Usage
Probucol is an antilipemic agent primarily used as an adjunct to diet therapy in managing primary hypercholesterolemia.  This means it's used alongside a cholesterol-lowering diet to reduce high cholesterol levels in the blood.  It's also sometimes used for hypercholesterolemia combined with hypertriglyceridemia, meaning high cholesterol levels coupled with high triglyceride levels.  It's important to note that Probucol is generally considered a second-line treatment option after lifestyle changes and other cholesterol-lowering medications haven't been effective enough.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical adult dosage is 500 mg twice daily (BID), administered with meals.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Probucol in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment. Probucol is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis, or intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis (obstruction of bile flow).

### Side Effects
Probucol can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially more serious.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to a healthcare provider immediately.

* **Common:**  Headache, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality that can lead to serious arrhythmias),  torsades de pointes (a type of potentially fatal irregular heartbeat),  other serious heart rhythm problems (ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia),  liver enzyme elevation,  skin rash,  peripheral neuritis (nerve damage in the extremities).  Many other less common side effects including problems with the nervous system, gastrointestinal system, skin, endocrine system, blood, and other organ systems are possible.

### How it Works
Probucol works by increasing the excretion of LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) in the feces.  It also reduces the body's production of cholesterol and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the intestines. These actions contribute to lowering overall cholesterol levels in the bloodstream.

### Precautions
Probucol is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in several situations:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Probucol or any of its ingredients.
* Severe ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).
* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm).
* Myocardial damage (heart muscle injury).
* History of unexplained syncope (fainting).
* Pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding.
* Acute or chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation).
* Inflammatory bowel disease.
* Intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestasis (bile duct blockage).

**Drug Interactions:** Probucol can interact with certain medications, increasing the risk of side effects.  Concurrent use with tricyclic antidepressants, Class I or III antiarrhythmics, phenothiazines, or other drugs that prolong the QT interval should be avoided because of the increased risk of arrhythmias.  Simultaneous use with cyclosporine can decrease cyclosporine blood levels.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

**Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or ventricular arrhythmias.  Caution is also warranted in elderly patients and those with liver problems.
