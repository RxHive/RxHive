# Papaverine + Phentolamine
### Generic Name
Papaverine + Phentolamine

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men.  It's administered directly into the penis (intracavernosal injection) to induce an erection.  This treatment is typically reserved for men who haven't responded to other ED treatments or have specific medical conditions that make oral medications unsuitable.  It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for ED and should only be used under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Erectile Dysfunction):** The typical dose involves an intracavernosal injection of 30mg of papaverine and 1mg of phentolamine.  The injection should be administered slowly.  An erection usually develops within 5-20 minutes and lasts up to an hour.  The frequency of use should not exceed twice a week, with at least 24 hours between injections.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on individual response, but this should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Pediatric Dosage:** This combination is not indicated for use in children.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Bruising or bleeding at the injection site
* Mild burning sensation along the penis
* Difficulty ejaculating
* Swelling at the injection site
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Nasal stuffiness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Acute and prolonged hypotensive episodes (severe low blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Priapism (a prolonged, painful erection lasting more than four hours)

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these serious side effects or if any side effect is severe or persistent.

### How it Works
Papaverine is a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes and widens blood vessels.  Phentolamine is an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, which also helps relax blood vessels.  When injected into the penis, these medications work together to increase blood flow to the erectile tissues, leading to an erection.  The increased blood flow is facilitated by the relaxation of the smooth muscles in the blood vessels of the penis.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity to papaverine, phentolamine, or any components of the formulation
* History of myocardial infarction (heart attack), coronary insufficiency, angina, or other coronary artery diseases
* Conditions that increase the risk of priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, leukemia)
* Anatomical deformation of the penis or penile implants


**Warnings:**

* Use with caution in patients with bleeding problems or a history of priapism.
* Increased risk of liver damage.
* Avoid smoking and alcohol consumption as they can interfere with the medication's effectiveness and potentially increase the risk of side effects.
* Patients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of priapism (a prolonged, painful erection) and seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.  Untreated priapism can lead to permanent erectile dysfunction.
*  Patients should report any lumps at the injection site or penile curvature to their doctor.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** This medication is not indicated for use in women.  Its safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established.  Category C pregnancy risk.
