# Povidone Iodine + Sucralfate

There is no commercially available generic combination drug of Povidone-Iodine and Sucralfate.  These are two distinct drugs with different mechanisms of action and uses. They are often used *separately* in treating wounds and gastrointestinal issues, but not together in a single formulation.

Therefore, providing details in the requested format for a non-existent combination is impossible.  To provide useful information, we can discuss each drug individually:


**Povidone-Iodine**

**Generic Name:** Povidone-Iodine (also known as PVP-Iodine)

**Usage:** Topical antiseptic used to disinfect skin and mucous membranes before surgery, to treat minor wounds and burns, and to prevent infection in cuts and scrapes.

**Side Effects:** Skin irritation, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), staining of skin and clothing.  Rarely, thyroid problems (with prolonged or extensive use).
