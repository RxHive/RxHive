# Phenylephrine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Phenylephrine (Systemic)

### Usage
Phenylephrine (systemic) is primarily used to raise blood pressure in adults experiencing clinically significant hypotension (low blood pressure) caused mainly by vasodilation (widening of blood vessels).  This is particularly relevant in situations like septic shock (a life-threatening condition caused by overwhelming infection) or during anesthesia.  It's also used as a nasal decongestant, although this is a different route of administration (nasal spray or drops) and not covered by this systemic (injectable or oral) information.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.

* **Hypotension/Shock (IV):**  The initial dose should not exceed 500 mcg.  This can be administered as an IV bolus (100-500 mcg every 10-15 minutes as needed) or as a continuous infusion (100-180 mcg/min or 0.5 mcg/kg/min, titrated to response with a maximum of 200 mcg/min).  Maintenance doses are much lower once blood pressure stabilizes.

* **Septic/Vasodilatory Shock (IV):**  This usually involves a continuous infusion of 0.5-6 mcg/kg/min, carefully adjusted to achieve the desired mean arterial pressure (MAP).

* **Hypotension During Anesthesia (IV):** This can involve IV boluses (40-100 mcg every 1-2 minutes, up to a maximum of 200 mcg) or continuous infusions (10-35 mcg/min or 0.5-1.4 mcg/kg/min), adjusted to maintain blood pressure.

* **Oral (Nasal Congestion):**  10 mg every 4 hours as needed, not to exceed 60 mg in 24 hours, for a maximum of 7 days.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower and depends on age and weight.  It should only be administered under the strict supervision of a physician and often adjusted based on individual responses.  Always refer to a healthcare professional for specific pediatric guidelines.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, restlessness.
* **Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  High blood pressure (hypertension), irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), worsening of heart failure, low cardiac output, angina exacerbation, decreased urine output, decreased renal blood flow, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions (rash, hives).  In case of extravasation (leakage from the IV site), immediate medical attention is crucial.

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list. Consult a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works

Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist. This means it directly stimulates alpha-1 receptors in blood vessels, causing them to constrict (narrow). This constriction increases peripheral vascular resistance, which leads to an increase in blood pressure.  The effect on heart rate is usually a slight slowing due to baroreceptor reflexes, though this is less prominent than the vasoconstriction.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to phenylephrine; use within 14 days of MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) therapy for oral preparations (in over-the-counter decongestants).

* **Interactions:**  Phenylephrine can interact with numerous drugs, including MAOIs, alpha-1 blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and others.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:** Use with extreme caution in patients with heart disease (e.g., coronary artery disease, bradycardia, heart failure), high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, prostate problems, glaucoma, or those with pre-existing bowel issues.  Extra caution is needed in elderly patients, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children.  The benzyl alcohol-containing formulations should be avoided in neonates due to the risk of gasping syndrome.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for phenylephrine to work?** A: The onset of action varies based on the route and dose.  Intravenous administration works quickly, while oral administration takes longer.

* **Q: How long should I use phenylephrine?** A: The duration of use depends on the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions of your doctor or pharmacist.  For nasal congestion, oral formulations shouldn't be used for more than 7 days.

* **Q: Can I take phenylephrine with other medications?** A:  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining phenylephrine with other medications to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.

* **Q: How should I store phenylephrine?** A: Store according to the label instructions, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If it's an oral dose for nasal congestion and close to the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with the regular dosing schedule. Never double up on doses.  For intravenous use, consult your healthcare provider.
