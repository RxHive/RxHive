# Pygeum
### Generic Name
Pygeum (Prunus africana)

### Usage
Pygeum, derived from the bark of the *Prunus africana* tree, is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as an enlarged prostate.  BPH symptoms commonly include difficulty urinating, frequent urination, especially at night (nocturia), weak urine stream, and a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.  While some studies suggest potential benefits in prostate cancer,  more research is needed to confirm its efficacy in this area.  It's crucial to understand that Pygeum is not a cure for BPH or prostate cancer, but rather aims to alleviate symptoms.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using Pygeum for any condition.

### Dosage
The dosage of Pygeum varies depending on the formulation and the specific product used.  Most standardized extracts are formulated to contain a specific percentage of total sterols (typically 14%).  A common adult dosage for BPH is 100 mg per day, often taken in cycles of 6-8 weeks.  However, dosages can range from 25 mg to 200 mg daily.  It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or as directed on the product label.  There is limited data on safe and effective dosages for children, and its use in children is generally not recommended without specific medical advice.  Different forms of Pygeum exist, including capsules and tablets.  Always take Pygeum as directed by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
While generally well-tolerated, Pygeum can cause some side effects in some individuals. These may include:

* Gastrointestinal irritation (nausea, constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain)
* Headache

Serious side effects are uncommon, but if you experience any unusual symptoms, discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
The exact mechanism of Pygeum's action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to influence several processes within the prostate gland.  It may inhibit the binding of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that plays a significant role in prostate growth.  Some evidence also suggests it might inhibit 5-alpha reductase and aromatase, enzymes involved in hormone metabolism. By interfering with these processes, Pygeum may help reduce prostate size and improve urinary flow.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Avoid using Pygeum during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as there's insufficient data on its safety during these periods.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions are not extensively documented, itâ€™s prudent to inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you are taking before using Pygeum to assess potential interactions.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with known allergies to plants in the *Prunus* family (like cherries, plums, peaches) should exercise caution.
* **Other Health Conditions:**  Consult a doctor before using Pygeum if you have any underlying health conditions, especially those affecting the liver or kidneys.
