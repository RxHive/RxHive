# Paracetamol + Piroxicam

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Piroxicam

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation.  Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever and mild to moderate pain. Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation.  The combination is often prescribed for conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Other inflammatory conditions causing pain

**Note:**  This combination is not available in all countries and its use is becoming less common due to the potential for increased side effects compared to using each drug individually.  Always consult a doctor before taking this or any medication.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can occur with either Paracetamol or Piroxicam, or both.  These can range from mild to severe and include:

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Stomach ulcers, bleeding in the stomach or intestines, increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use), liver damage (especially with high doses of paracetamol), kidney problems, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe skin reactions, blood disorders


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to reduce fever by acting on the area of the brain that regulates temperature. It also inhibits the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain and inflammation, but less so than NSAIDs.

* **Piroxicam:** This is an NSAID that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in inflammation, pain, and fever.  By inhibiting prostaglandins, piroxicam reduces pain and swelling.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A: No, alcohol can increase the risk of stomach bleeding and liver damage, especially when combined with piroxicam and paracetamol.

* **Q: Can I take this medication long-term?** A: Long-term use should only be done under strict medical supervision due to the increased risk of serious side effects, particularly related to the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: What should I do if I overdose?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Paracetamol overdose can cause serious liver damage, and piroxicam overdose can have various severe consequences.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: Yes, many interactions are possible.  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
