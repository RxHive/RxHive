# Paracetamol + Piroxicam
### Generic Name
Paracetamol + Piroxicam

### Usage

This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation.  Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works to reduce inflammation and pain.  The combination is often prescribed for conditions where both pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects are needed.  Primary uses include:

* **Osteoarthritis:** To reduce joint pain and inflammation.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** To manage pain and inflammation in the joints.
* **Other inflammatory conditions:**  May be used for other inflammatory conditions causing pain, although this should be under the guidance of a doctor.  This is not a first-line treatment for most inflammatory conditions.


It's crucial to understand that this combination medication treats symptoms, not the underlying cause of the condition.  If you have a persistent or worsening condition, it's essential to seek medical advice from a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the specific formulation (tablet, capsule, etc.), the manufacturer, the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.  **It is extremely important to follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist precisely.**  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.  Never use this medication without a prescription from your doctor.  There are no generally recommended oral or IV dosages that can be listed here, as this medication is not usually given intravenously.  If an IV form exists, it must be administered by a medical professional and the exact dosage will be determined by a doctor based on the individual patient's case.

For oral administration:  Typical dosages usually involve specific tablet strengths of Paracetamol and Piroxicam combined, for example, a tablet might contain 500mg of Paracetamol and 20mg of Piroxicam.  Always check the label for exact dosage and administration instructions for your specific brand.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea.
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Skin rash**
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) can occur.

Less common, but serious side effects may include:

* **Kidney problems:** Reduced urine output, swelling in the legs and ankles.
* **Liver damage:**  (More likely with excessive Paracetamol use)
* **Bleeding:** Increased risk of bleeding or bruising.
* **Cardiovascular problems:** Increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use).


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention.

### How it Works

Paracetamol reduces fever and pain, but its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood.  It is believed to work by interfering with the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).  Piroxicam is an NSAID that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins throughout the body. Prostaglandins are chemicals that contribute to pain, fever, and inflammation.  By inhibiting their production, both components of this medication alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.

### Precautions
