# Pefloxacin

**Generic Name:** Pefloxacin

**Usage:** Pefloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  These infections may affect the:

* **Respiratory tract:** Pneumonia, bronchitis
* **Skin and soft tissues:**  Cellulitis, abscesses
* **Urinary tract:**  Urinary tract infections (UTIs), prostatitis
* **Bones and joints:** Osteomyelitis
* **Gastrointestinal tract:**  Certain types of diarrhea caused by susceptible bacteria (though this is less common now due to resistance)

**Note:**  Pefloxacin is *not* effective against viral infections like the common cold or flu.  The specific usage will depend on the infection and the doctor's prescription.  It's crucial to complete the entire course of medication even if you feel better to prevent the recurrence of infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, pefloxacin can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation
* **Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, insomnia
* **Skin:** Rash, itching
* **Musculoskeletal:** Joint pain, tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), tendon rupture (rare but serious)
* **Other:**  Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis), photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)


**Serious side effects, though rare, can include:**

* **Allergic reactions:**  Difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (anaphylaxis)
* **Central nervous system effects:** Seizures, confusion, hallucinations
* **Liver problems:** Hepatitis
* **Kidney problems:**  Acute renal failure


If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:** Pefloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. By inhibiting these enzymes, pefloxacin prevents bacterial cells from reproducing and ultimately leads to their death.
