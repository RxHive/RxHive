# Pefloxacin
### Generic Name
Pefloxacin

### Usage

Pefloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating severe bacterial infections, including those affecting the blood (septicemia), heart lining (endocarditis), brain and spinal cord coverings (meningitis), respiratory system (upper and lower tract infections), skin and soft tissues, urinary tract, bones and joints, and the abdomen and pelvic area (gynecological infections).  It's also used to treat uncomplicated gonorrhea in men and uncomplicated bladder infections (cystitis) in women.  However, it's crucial to note that the use of pefloxacin for less severe infections like uncomplicated urinary tract infections, sinusitis, or bronchitis exacerbations should be reserved for patients with no other treatment options due to the potential for serious side effects.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Severe Bacterial Infections:** The typical oral dosage is 400 mg twice daily (BID). A single loading dose of 800 mg may be given initially.  The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection's severity and response to therapy.
* **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (men) and Uncomplicated Cystitis (women):** A single oral dose of 800 mg is typically prescribed.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Pefloxacin's safety and effectiveness haven't been established in children.  It is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired liver function. Specific adjustments depend on the severity of the impairment (mild, moderate, or severe) and the presence of ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen) or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).  Consult a physician or pharmacist for precise dosage recommendations in these cases.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment, but caution is advised.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Anxiety

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Tendonitis (inflammation of tendons) and tendon rupture (especially the Achilles tendon)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage)
* Seizures
* Liver damage
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity)
* Blood disorders (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, immediately consult a healthcare professional.  This list isn't exhaustive, and other side effects are possible.

### How it Works

Pefloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial enzymes called DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication, repair, and transcription. By inhibiting these enzymes, pefloxacin prevents bacterial DNA from unwinding and replicating, leading to bacterial cell death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pefloxacin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to pefloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or any formulation components. It is also contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children under 15 years old, and individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pefloxacin can interact with various medications, including antacids, iron salts, didanosine, sucralfate, theophylline, cimetidine, probenecid, cyclosporine, NSAIDs, and others.  These interactions can affect the absorption or excretion of pefloxacin or other medications, potentially leading to decreased effectiveness or increased side effects.
* **Warnings:** Pefloxacin can prolong the QT interval (a measure of heart rhythm), increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. It's essential to use caution in patients with pre-existing heart conditions or those taking medications that also prolong the QT interval.  The drug may also increase the risk of CNS effects (seizures, etc.) and should be used cautiously in patients with a history of CNS disorders.  Patients should be warned about photosensitivity and advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take pefloxacin with other medications?**  A: It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting pefloxacin to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store pefloxacin?** A: Store pefloxacin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking pefloxacin?** A: It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking pefloxacin, as it can increase the risk of certain side effects.  Consult with your healthcare provider.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: When will I start to feel better?** A: The time it takes to feel better varies depending on the infection and your individual response to treatment.  It's crucial to complete the entire course of prescribed medication, even if you start to feel better before it's finished.
