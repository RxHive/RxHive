# Phenoxyethanol
### Generic Name
Phenoxyethanol

### Usage

Phenoxyethanol is primarily used as a preservative in various products, notably in cosmetics and some pharmaceutical preparations like vaccines. Its main function is to inhibit the growth of microorganisms, preventing spoilage and contamination.  While not directly a medication itself, its role in preserving the efficacy and safety of other products is crucial.  One example of its use is as a preservative in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved polio vaccine.  The FDA has also reviewed and approved its use as an indirect food additive.  The European Union also permits its use as a preservative in cosmetic products at a specific concentration.


### Dosage

There is no "dosage" of phenoxyethanol in the sense of a therapeutic medication.  Its concentration is controlled within specific product formulations.  For instance, in the FDA-approved polio vaccine, the concentration is 0.5%. In cosmetic products within the European Union, the maximum allowable concentration is 1.0%. The specific concentration is determined by the manufacturer based on the intended use and product type, and itâ€™s vital to rely on the product label for the accurate amount present in any given product.


### Side Effects

Phenoxyethanol is generally considered safe at the concentrations used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. However, some individuals may experience adverse reactions.  These are uncommon but can include:

* Skin irritation (such as redness, itching, or rash)
* Eye irritation (if it comes into contact with eyes)
* Allergic reactions (in rare cases)


More serious side effects are rare, but immediately seeking medical attention is crucial if any unusual symptoms arise following exposure.

### How it Works

Phenoxyethanol acts as a preservative by disrupting the microbial cell membrane. This disruption interferes with the microorganism's ability to function and ultimately leads to its death or inability to reproduce. This effect is more pronounced against certain types of bacteria, such as *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, while its efficacy against other bacteria (e.g., *Proteus vulgaris*) and gram-positive bacteria is less significant.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with known sensitivities to phenoxyethanol should avoid products containing it.
* **Skin and Eye Contact:**  Avoid direct contact with skin and eyes. Rinse thoroughly with water if contact occurs.
* **Ingestion:**  Ingestion should be avoided.  If ingested, immediately seek medical attention.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe at low concentrations, pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using products containing phenoxyethanol.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be cautious, following the same precautions as for adults and adhering to product labeling.
* **Interactions:**  There is limited data regarding interactions with other substances.  However, it is always advisable to consult a doctor if you are using multiple products containing it.
