# Permethrin

**Generic Name:** Permethrin

**Usage:**

Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide used to kill insects and mites.  Its uses vary depending on the formulation:

* **Topical Cream/Lotion (for humans):** Treatment and prevention of head lice infestations and scabies.  It's also sometimes used to treat other insect bites and stings, though this is less common and should only be done under a doctor's supervision.
* **Cream Rinse (for humans):** Primarily for head lice treatment.
* **Aerosol Sprays/Liquids (for animals):** Treatment and prevention of fleas, ticks, and other external parasites on pets (cats and dogs, usually).  Specific formulations exist for different animals and should be used only as directed.
* **Household Insecticides:** Used to control a wide variety of insects in homes and gardens, including ants, spiders, cockroaches, fleas, and mosquitoes.  Formulations vary greatly.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects depend heavily on the formulation and method of application.

* **Topical applications (humans):**  Burning, stinging, or itching at the application site are common.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur, including skin rash, swelling, and difficulty breathing.
* **Inhalation (from aerosols):** Coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath are possible.  Severe reactions are rare but can occur in sensitive individuals.
* **Ingestion:** This is extremely dangerous and should never be intentional.  Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and neurological effects.
* **Animal applications:**  Some animals may experience temporary skin irritation.  Always follow label directions carefully.


**How it Works:**

Permethrin works by disrupting the nervous systems of insects and mites.  It affects the sodium channels in their nerve cells, causing paralysis and death.  It's more effective against insects than mammals due to differences in the structure of their sodium channels.  Essentially, it acts as a neurotoxin, but is generally considered safe for humans and animals in appropriate concentrations and formulations when used as directed.
