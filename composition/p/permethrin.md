# Permethrin
### Generic Name
Permethrin

### Usage
Permethrin is a topical insecticide used to treat infestations caused by parasites.  Its primary use is in eliminating head lice ( *Pediculus humanus capitis*) and their eggs (nits). It's also highly effective against scabies ( *Sarcoptes scabiei*), a contagious skin infestation caused by a mite.  Additionally, permethrin is used to treat pubic lice ( *Pthirus pubis*).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Pediculosis capitis (Head Lice):**  For 1% permethrin lotion or cream rinse, apply 30-60 mL to dry, washed hair. Leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly and comb out lice and nits. One application is usually sufficient, but a second application may be needed after 7-10 days if necessary.  For severe cases or lice resistance to 1% permethrin, a 5% permethrin cream may be applied to clean, dry hair, left on overnight (8-14 hours) under a shower cap, and repeated after 7-10 days if needed.

* **Pediculosis pubis (Pubic Lice):** Apply a sufficient amount of 1% permethrin cream to saturate the pubic area. Leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse with water. Repeat after 7-10 days if necessary.

* **Scabies (Non-crusted):** Apply a sufficient amount of 5% permethrin cream from head to toe. Leave on for 8-14 hours, then wash off with soap and water.  One application is usually curative, but a second application may be necessary after 14 days.

* **Scabies (Crusted):** Apply a sufficient amount of 5% permethrin cream from head to toe and leave on for 8-14 hours, then wash off. Use daily for 7 days, then twice weekly until cured.  Combination therapy with oral ivermectin is often recommended for crusted scabies.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

For children over 2 months old, the dosage is the same as for adults.  The safety and effectiveness of permethrin in infants under 2 months have not been established.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Nervous system: Local discomfort (scalp), localized burning, localized numbness, and tingling.
* Dermatologic: Itching (pruritus), redness (erythema), skin rash, and stinging.
* Local: Localized swelling (edema).

Less common, but serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Permethrin works by interfering with the sodium channels in the nerve cells of the parasites (lice and mites). This disruption of nerve impulse transmission leads to paralysis and ultimately the death of the pests, effectively treating the infestation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Permethrin is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to pyrethroids, pyrethrins, or any component of the formulation. It should not be used in infants under 2 months old. Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, and other mucous membranes.

* **Warnings:**  Individuals with ragweed allergies may have an increased risk of asthmatic attacks or dyspnea. Skin irritation is also possible.  Always follow the instructions carefully.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Permethrin is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. While considered a drug of choice for treating pubic lice and scabies during pregnancy by the CDC, consult your doctor.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding may need to be temporarily discontinued or the drug withheld while breastfeeding.

* **General Precautions:** Permethrin is for external use only.  Wash clothing, bedding, and other items that may have been in contact with the infested person to prevent re-infestation.
