# Pimavanserin
### Generic Name
Pimavanserin

### Usage
Pimavanserin is primarily used to treat hallucinations and delusions in patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis.  This means it helps manage the symptoms of psychosis (loss of contact with reality) that can sometimes occur in individuals with Parkinson's disease.  It's important to note that pimavanserin is *not* approved for use in treating psychosis related to other conditions like dementia.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical adult dose is 34 mg once daily.  This dose is generally started without a titration (gradual increase) period.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in certain situations:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for those with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for those with creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¥ 30 mL/min.  For CrCl < 30 mL/min or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis, use caution as there may be increased exposure to the drug.  No dosage adjustment is necessary, but close monitoring is recommended.
* **Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole):** If taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the recommended dose of pimavanserin is reduced to 10 mg once daily.
* **Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's Wort):**  Concomitant use should be avoided.
* **Switching from Clozapine or Quetiapine:**  Specific dosage reduction schedules for switching from clozapine or quetiapine to pimavanserin exist and involve a gradual tapering of the previous medication while initiating pimavanserin. These schedules vary based on the initial dose of clozapine or quetiapine and require careful medical supervision.  Consult the prescribing information for detailed instructions.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of pimavanserin in children have not been established.

**Administration:** Pimavanserin comes in capsule form.  The capsules can be swallowed whole or opened and sprinkled onto a spoonful of applesauce, yogurt, pudding, or a liquid nutritional supplement.  The mixture should be consumed immediately.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Confusion, hallucinations, abnormal gait
* Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, constipation

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cardiovascular: QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm) on ECG.  This requires close monitoring.

**Other reported side effects (less than 1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**  Aggressive behavior, agitation, angioedema, drowsiness, falls, skin rash, urticaria.

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Pimavanserin works primarily by acting as an inverse agonist and antagonist at the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor.  This means it either blocks or reverses the activity of this receptor in the brain.  The 5-HT2A receptor is thought to play a role in the development of psychosis, and by affecting its activity, pimavanserin can help reduce hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. It has a low affinity for other receptors, minimizing many of the side effects associated with other antipsychotics.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pimavanserin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to pimavanserin or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  Pimavanserin may increase the risk of CNS depression, orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), falls, esophageal dysmotility and aspiration, and mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.
* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with Lewy body dementia, those at risk of aspiration pneumonia, those at risk for orthostatic hypotension, and elderly patients.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Use caution when co-administering with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or other medications that prolong the QT interval.  Close monitoring may be needed.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of pimavanserin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  The decision to use this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully weighed against the potential risks and benefits.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take pimavanserin with food?** A: Yes, pimavanserin may be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store pimavanserin?** A: Store pimavanserin at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking pimavanserin suddenly?** A: No, it's important to gradually taper off pimavanserin under the guidance of your doctor to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Is pimavanserin right for me?** A: Only your doctor can determine if pimavanserin is appropriate for your specific condition and health status.  Discuss your symptoms and medical history with your physician.

* **Q:  What is the boxed warning for Pimavanserin?** A:  There is an increased mortality risk in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotics, including Pimavanserin.  Pimavanserin is *not* approved for dementia-related psychosis.
