# Piperaquine + Artenimol
### Generic Name
Piperaquine + Artemether

### Usage
Piperaquine and Artemether is a combination antimalarial drug primarily used to treat uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, a parasite responsible for the most severe form of malaria.  It's crucial to note that this combination is *not* effective against other malaria-causing parasites like *Plasmodium vivax*, *Plasmodium malariae*, or *Plasmodium ovale*.  This medication is for uncomplicated malaria only; it's not suitable for severe malaria cases requiring hospitalization.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following dosage information is for guidance only.  Always follow your doctor's or other healthcare professional's specific instructions. Dosage is typically weight-based and varies depending on the patient's age and weight.  The World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidelines for dosing.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose based on individual needs.

**Adults:** The dosage is typically calculated based on body weight, aiming for a specific range of piperaquine and artemether per kilogram of body weight.  The medication is usually administered once daily for three days.

**Children:**  Similar to adults, the pediatric dosage is also determined by weight, following WHO recommendations.  The medication is administered once daily for three days.  Precise dosing instructions should be obtained from a physician or other healthcare provider.

**Different Forms:**  This medication is typically available in tablet form.

**Administration:** The medication should generally be taken on an empty stomach, at least 3 hours before or after a meal.  Do not take it with grapefruit juice.  If vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of taking the dose, re-administer the full dose. If vomiting occurs between 30-60 minutes after taking the dose, re-administer half the dose.  If vomiting occurs again, seek alternative treatment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Fever
* Cough
* Skin rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) â€“ this can increase the risk of serious heart rhythm problems.
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Liver problems (hepatitis)
* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially severe)

**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed above as serious,  consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Artemether, a fast-acting component, quickly kills the malaria parasite. Piperaquine, a longer-acting component, then prevents the parasite from multiplying and prevents relapse for several weeks.  Both components act on different stages of the parasite's life cycle.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not use this medication if you have a known allergy to piperaquine, artemether, or any of its ingredients.
* **Heart Conditions:** Use caution if you have a history of heart problems, especially arrhythmias or a prolonged QT interval.  This combination can potentially prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of dangerous heart rhythms.
* **Liver or Kidney Disease:**  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before use. Alternative antimalarial medications are generally preferred during pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, especially those that prolong the QT interval. Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Severe Malaria:** This combination is not suitable for treating severe malaria. Seek immediate medical attention if you have severe malaria symptoms.
* **Other Malaria Parasites:** This medication is not effective against other malaria parasites besides *Plasmodium falciparum*.
