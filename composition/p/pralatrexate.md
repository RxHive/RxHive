# Pralatrexate
### Generic Name
Pralatrexate

### Usage
Pralatrexate is primarily used to treat relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).  This means it's used for patients whose PTCL has come back after previous treatment (relapsed) or hasn't responded to prior therapies (refractory).  While not officially approved for this use, pralatrexate is sometimes used off-label for relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  It's crucial to remember that off-label use should only be considered under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional who carefully weighs the potential benefits against the risks.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The standard dosage for relapsed or refractory PTCL is 30 mg/m² administered intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes once weekly for six weeks of a seven-week treatment cycle.  For relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (off-label), the dosage is typically reduced to 15 mg/m² once weekly for three weeks of a four-week cycle.

**Important Note:**  Before each dose, the patient's blood counts (ANC and platelet count) and the severity of any mucositis (mouth sores) must be checked. Treatment may need to be delayed or adjusted based on these factors.  Crucially, concomitant vitamin supplementation is mandatory, including folic acid (1-1.25 mg orally four times a day) and vitamin B12 (1000 mcg IM).  Folic acid supplementation begins 10 days before treatment, continues throughout, and extends for 30 days post-treatment; Vitamin B12 is administered no more than 10 weeks before treatment and then every 8-10 weeks thereafter.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of pralatrexate in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments are necessary based on factors like renal and hepatic impairment, and the severity of side effects.  For example,  patients with reduced kidney function (eGFR) may require dose reduction.  Detailed guidelines are available in the full prescribing information, and a healthcare professional should guide any adjustments.  ASCO guidelines should be consulted for dosing in obese adults with cancer.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or persistent ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Pralatrexate is an antifolate analog. It works by interfering with the production of DNA, RNA, and proteins within cancer cells. It achieves this by selectively entering cells that express a specific protein called the reduced folate carrier (RFC-1). Once inside, it's converted into a more active form and blocks an enzyme called dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is crucial for cell growth and division. By inhibiting DHFR, pralatrexate prevents cancer cells from multiplying.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pralatrexate is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or its components.

* **Warnings and Precautions:**  Pralatrexate can cause significant bone marrow suppression, increasing the risk of infections and bleeding.  It also carries a risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage), mucositis, and dermatologic reactions.  Patients with impaired kidney or liver function require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments.  Tumor lysis syndrome (a potentially life-threatening complication) is a possibility, especially in patients with high tumor burden.  Women of childbearing potential and men with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for a period after treatment.  Pralatrexate is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning there is a positive evidence of human fetal risk.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during and after treatment.


* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), probenecid, and cotrimoxazole may increase pralatrexate levels in the body. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is pralatrexate administered?** A: Pralatrexate is given intravenously (IV).

* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: The duration varies depending on the patient’s response and the specific treatment regimen, but it usually involves several cycles, each lasting several weeks.
