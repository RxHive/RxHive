# Plasma
### Generic Name
Plasma (Pooled Human Plasma)

### Usage

Plasma is a blood product used primarily to replace multiple coagulation factors in individuals with acquired deficiencies.  These deficiencies can stem from liver disease, or arise during procedures like cardiac surgery or liver transplantation.  Another significant use is in plasma exchange for patients diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare and life-threatening blood disorder.  In essence, plasma provides a concentrated source of various clotting factors and proteins vital for normal blood function.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends heavily on the patient's condition and the reason for plasma administration.  ABO blood compatibility is crucial and must always be considered.

**Replacement of Coagulation Factors:**

* **Adults:** The initial intravenous (IV) dose typically ranges from 10-15 mL/kg.  The goal is to increase plasma coagulation factors by approximately 15-25%. If hemostasis (stopping bleeding) isn't achieved with the initial dose, higher doses may be necessary under medical supervision.

* **Children:**  The safety and efficacy of plasma in children have not been established.  Its use in pediatric patients should only be considered under strict medical guidance.

**Plasma Exchange (for TTP):**

* **Adults:**  The IV dose is usually 40-60 mL/kg, equivalent to replacing 1-1.5 plasma volumes.  The plasma removed during plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) is completely replaced with pooled human plasma.

* **Children:**  Dosage in children for plasma exchange is not established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution should be exercised when administering plasma to individuals with liver problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Nausea

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Abdominal pain
* Alkalosis (high blood pH)
* Anaphylactic shock
* Anaphylactoid reactions
* Bronchospasm
* Chest pain or discomfort
* Chills
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Erythema (redness)
* Fever
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Hypotension (low blood pressure, potentially severe)
* Hypervolemia (excess fluid in the blood)
* Increased fibrinolysis (excessive breakdown of blood clots)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Respiratory failure
* Skin rash
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
* Thromboembolism (blood clot blocking a vessel)
* Vomiting

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Plasma acts by replenishing various plasma proteins and coagulation factors. These components are essential for maintaining blood clotting, immune function, and overall fluid balance.  By replacing deficient or missing proteins, plasma helps to restore normal physiological processes in individuals with acquired deficiencies or during plasma exchange procedures. The specific beneficial effects depend on the reason for administration, for example, providing clotting factors to stop bleeding, or removing harmful antibodies in the case of TTP.


### Precautions

**Contraindications (Plasma should NOT be used if):**

* History of hypersensitivity to pooled human plasma, fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), or any plasma-derived products.
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).
* Manifest or latent cardiac decompensation (heart failure).
* IgA deficiency with documented antibodies against IgA.
* Severe protein S deficiency.


**Warnings and Increased Risks:**

* Citrate toxicity (due to the anticoagulant used in processing plasma), potentially leading to hypocalcemia (low calcium) with symptoms such as fatigue, paresthesia, and muscle spasms.
* Hyperfibrinolysis (excessive clot breakdown).
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis).
* Hypervolemia (fluid overload) potentially causing pulmonary edema or heart failure.
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation).
* Transfusion reactions.

**Use with Caution:** In patients with hepatic impairment (liver disease).


### FAQs

* **Q: How is plasma stored?** A:  Plasma storage requirements vary depending on the specific product and should be checked on the product label. Generally, plasma is stored frozen.

* **Q: Can I use plasma if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Plasma is a Category C pregnancy drug.  Use during pregnancy is possible, especially in conditions like TTP where the benefits might outweigh the risks.  Consult your healthcare provider.  Plasma components are naturally present in breast milk.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of using plasma?** A:  Long-term effects are generally uncommon. However, the risk of complications such as infection, allergic reactions, and transfusion-related adverse events always exists. Regular monitoring is important.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above as less common, but serious.
