# Perampanel
### Generic Name
Perampanel

### Usage
Perampanel is used as an add-on therapy (meaning it's taken in addition to other medications) to treat certain types of seizures in people with epilepsy.  Specifically, it's approved for:

*   **Partial-onset seizures:** These seizures begin in one part of the brain and may or may not spread to other areas.  They can involve a variety of symptoms, from brief sensory disturbances to more complex motor movements or altered awareness.
*   **Primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures:** These seizures affect the entire brain and cause a loss of consciousness along with muscle stiffening (tonic phase) and jerking (clonic phase).

Perampanel is not a first-line treatment for seizures; it's used when other medications haven't been fully effective.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, other medications being taken (particularly enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs - AEDs), and response to treatment.  Always follow the prescription from a healthcare professional carefully.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be used to self-medicate.

**Adults:**

*   **Partial-onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (adjunctive therapy):**  Treatment begins with a low dose (2 mg or 4 mg daily, depending on other AEDs) at bedtime and is gradually increased by 2 mg per week under close medical supervision, up to a maximum daily dose that varies depending on the patient's response and tolerance.  Most patients will reach a maintenance dose between 8-12 mg daily.

**Children:**

Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age, type of seizure, and presence of other AEDs.  The use of Perampanel in children is generally restricted to those aged 4 years or older for partial-onset seizures and 12 years or older for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  Again, precise dosing instructions must be obtained from a physician. Lower starting doses and slower titration schedules are typically used for children.


**Administration:** Perampanel is typically administered orally as a tablet or oral suspension (liquid). The oral suspension should be shaken well before each dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments are often necessary based on liver and kidney function.  Reduced doses are generally recommended for individuals with mild to moderate liver impairment; it's usually not recommended for those with severe liver or kidney impairment.  Elderly patients may also require more gradual dose increases.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These side effects are relatively frequent and can be mild to moderate in severity.

*   Dizziness
*   Drowsiness
*   Vertigo
*   Headache
*   Fatigue
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Gait disturbances (problems with walking)
*   Irritability

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** These side effects are less frequent but can be serious and require immediate medical attention.

*   Psychiatric disturbances (aggression, hostility, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, psychosis)
*   Falls
*   Cognitive impairment (memory problems, confusion)
*   Skin rashes (including DRESS syndromeâ€”a rare but severe allergic reaction)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Perampanel works by blocking AMPA receptors in the brain.  AMPA receptors are involved in the transmission of excitatory signals between nerve cells.  By blocking these receptors, Perampanel helps to reduce the excessive electrical activity in the brain that causes seizures. The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but this blockage contributes to its anti-seizure effect.


### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Perampanel should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to the medication or its components.
*   **Psychiatric Effects:** A significant risk of serious psychiatric side effects, including aggression, hostility, and suicidal thoughts, exists.  Close monitoring is crucial, especially during dosage adjustment.
*   **Falls:**  Dizziness and gait disturbances increase the risk of falls.  Caution is advised, particularly in elderly individuals.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Perampanel can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by liver enzymes (CYP450 enzymes).  Always inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  It can reduce the effectiveness of some hormonal contraceptives (containing levonorgestrel).
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Perampanel is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to a developing fetus are unknown.  It's essential to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using Perampanel during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
*   **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments are often necessary for individuals with kidney or liver problems.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I stop taking Perampanel suddenly?**  A: No.  Abruptly stopping Perampanel can increase the frequency of seizures.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose.

*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Perampanel?** A: No. Alcohol can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects. Avoid alcohol consumption while taking Perampanel.

*   **Q: How should I store Perampanel?** A: Store Perampanel at room temperature, away from moisture and light, as directed on the label.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

*   **Q: Is Perampanel habit-forming?** A: Perampanel is not considered a controlled substance and does not typically cause physical dependence. However, it's essential to continue taking it as prescribed and not discontinue the medication abruptly.
