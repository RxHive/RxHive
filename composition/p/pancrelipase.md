# Pancrelipase
### Generic Name
Pancrelipase

### Usage
Pancrelipase is a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.  Its primary use is to treat exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). This condition occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough digestive enzymes, leading to impaired digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. EPI can result from various conditions, most notably cystic fibrosis (CF), but also chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or after pancreatic surgery (pancreatectomy). Pancrelipase helps alleviate symptoms associated with EPI, such as steatorrhea (fatty stools), abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, and malnutrition.  While primarily used for these conditions, off-label use in pancreatic cancer may be considered under a doctor's guidance.


### Dosage

**Dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors such as the severity of the condition, the patient's age and weight, and the fat content of their diet.**  It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.  The following are general guidelines, and doses are typically expressed in lipase units:


**Adults:**

* **Cystic Fibrosis or other causes of EPI:** The initial dose is usually 500 lipase units/kg/meal. This can be adjusted to a range of 500-2500 lipase units/kg/meal, with a maximum daily dose of 10,000 lipase units/kg/day or less than 4000 lipase units per gram of fat daily.  The dosage is often adjusted based on the patient's response and fecal fat analysis.
* **Pancreatic cancer (off-label):**  Initial doses may be significantly higher (25,000-50,000 lipase units/meal) and adjusted based on symptom relief.  Again, this is under strict medical supervision.

**Children:**

Dosage varies greatly with age and weight.  For infants and young children with CF, the dosage is often based on the volume of formula or breast milk consumed, typically aiming for a specific lipase unit amount per feeding. For older children, the dosage approximates adult guidelines, adjusted for weight.  Always consult a doctor for precise pediatric dosing.

**Administration:**

Pancrelipase is usually given orally with meals or snacks. Capsules should be swallowed whole with plenty of liquid.  In some cases, the contents of the capsules can be sprinkled onto soft, acidic foods (pH ≤4.5) for those who cannot swallow capsules.  Never crush or chew the capsules.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Abdominal pain

**Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% or less):**

* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, flatulence, abdominal discomfort
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling)
*  Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas – a serious complication)
* Fibrosing colonopathy (scarring of the colon)
*  Interactions with other medications (see below)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)

**If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Pancrelipase contains enzymes (lipase, protease, and amylase) that aid in the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. These enzymes are normally produced by the pancreas but are deficient in individuals with EPI.  By supplementing these enzymes, pancrelipase helps the body break down food more effectively, improving nutrient absorption and reducing symptoms of maldigestion.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Pancrelipase is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to porcine-derived products or any of the formulation's components.  Those with a history of allergic reactions to pork should exercise caution.
* **Acute Pancreatitis:** Do not use pancrelipase if you have acute pancreatitis or an acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Pancrelipase can affect the absorption of certain medications, particularly iron salts and some vitamins/minerals.  Discuss potential interactions with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pancrelipase is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully established.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision.
* **Renal and hepatic impairment:**  Though specific dosage adjustments are not always prescribed, caution should be exercised in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Children:** Careful monitoring of growth and development is crucial in children receiving pancrelipase therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew Pancrelipase capsules?** A: No, crushing or chewing the capsules can irritate the mouth and reduce the effectiveness of the medication. Swallow them whole with liquid.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Pancrelipase?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Can I take Pancrelipase with other medications?** A:  Discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor or pharmacist.  Some interactions are possible.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects, particularly severe ones, to your healthcare provider immediately.  They may adjust your dosage or recommend alternative treatment.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Pancrelipase?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the underlying condition and your response to therapy.  This is determined by your doctor.
