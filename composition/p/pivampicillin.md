# Pivampicillin
### Generic Name
Pivampicillin

### Usage
Pivampicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic, specifically a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of ampicillin.  Its primary use is in treating various bacterial infections. This includes respiratory tract infections like acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis; ear, nose, and throat infections; gynecological infections; and urinary tract infections, including acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis.  It's important to note that the effectiveness of Pivampicillin depends on the type of bacteria causing the infection.  It is most effective against susceptible gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Bacterial Infections (oral):** The typical dose is 500 mg twice daily (BID).  In severe infections, the doctor may double this dose.
* **Gonococcal Urethritis (oral):** A single 1.5 g dose is usually prescribed, along with 1 g of probenecid.

**Children:**  Pivampicillin suspension is generally not recommended for severe infections in children under 3 months.

* **Children 3 months to 1 year (oral):** 40-60 mg/kg/day divided into two doses.
* **Children 2 to 10 years (oral):** 12.5-17.5 mg/kg BID, with a maximum daily dose of 500 mg.
* **Children over 10 years (oral):** 500 mg BID.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor for guidance if a patient has impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Blood disorders (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Kidney inflammation (interstitial nephritis)

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Pivampicillin is a prodrug, meaning it's inactive until it's metabolized in the body.  Once absorbed, enzymes break it down into ampicillin, the active form of the medication. Ampicillin works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls. By disrupting this process, ampicillin prevents bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, leading to their death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pivampicillin should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to penicillins, cephalosporins, or any component of the medication.  It is also contraindicated in patients with infectious mononucleosis, porphyria, and those with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins. Patients with secondary infections associated with infectious mononucleosis or lymphatic leukemia should also avoid it.  It is ineffective against infections caused by beta-lactamase (penicillinase) producing bacteria.

* **Interactions:**  Pivampicillin can interact with several other medications, including aminoglycosides, antacids, BCG vaccine, estrogens, macrolides, methotrexate, probenecid, sodium picosulfate, tetracyclines, valproic acid, and vitamin K antagonists.  These interactions can affect the effectiveness of either Pivampicillin or the other drug, sometimes leading to increased risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pivampicillin is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning studies in animals haven't shown harm to the fetus, but there is no adequate data in pregnant women.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Specific populations:**  Children under 3 months, individuals with impaired kidney or liver function, and older adults may require closer monitoring while taking Pivampicillin.

* **Other precautions:**  Maintain adequate hydration while on Pivampicillin. Avoid skin contact, as it may cause sensitization.  Avoid the intrathecal route of administration.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Pivampicillin with food?**  Yes, Pivampicillin can be taken with or without food, but taking it consistently (around the clock) might help maintain more consistent blood levels.

* **How should I store Pivampicillin?**  Store as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up doses.

* **What if I experience an allergic reaction?** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of an allergic reaction, such as rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.

* **Is Pivampicillin effective against all bacterial infections?** No, Pivampicillin is only effective against certain types of bacteria.  Your doctor will determine if it's the appropriate treatment for your infection.
