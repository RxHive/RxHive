# Polymyxin B + Neomycin + Bacitracin + Hydrocortisone
### Generic Name
Polymyxin B + Neomycin + Bacitracin + Hydrocortisone


### Usage

This combination medication is a topical antibiotic and corticosteroid used to treat a variety of bacterial skin infections.  It's primarily used for minor skin infections, such as:

* **Infections of minor cuts and scrapes:** The antibiotics (Polymyxin B, Neomycin, and Bacitracin) work together to kill a broad range of bacteria commonly causing these infections.
* **Infections of burns (minor):**  Similar to cuts and scrapes, this combination can help prevent secondary infection.
* **Infections of eczema or dermatitis:**  In cases where these conditions become infected, the antibiotics fight the infection, while the hydrocortisone helps reduce inflammation and itching.  *It's crucial to note that this is not a primary treatment for eczema or dermatitis and should only be used under a doctor's supervision if an infection is present.*
* **Other minor skin infections:**  The specific bacteria targeted by this combination make it effective against various skin infections.

It is important to remember that this medication is for external use only and should not be used for serious infections or infections that show no improvement after a few days of treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific product formulation and the severity of the infection.  Always follow the instructions provided on your prescription or the product packaging.  Generally, for topical application:

* **Adults and Children:**  A small amount of the ointment or cream should be applied to the affected area several times a day (typically 2-4 times), as directed by a doctor.  The medication should be gently rubbed into the skin until absorbed.
* **Children:**  Use should be under the strict supervision of a physician.  Dosage will be adjusted based on age and the extent of the skin infection.

**There are no IV formulations of this combination medication.**  It is only for topical (external) use.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* Mild redness or itching.
* Skin dryness or irritation.

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).
* Skin thinning or discoloration.
* Worsening of the skin infection.
* Secondary infection (due to overuse or improper use).

If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

This medication is a combination of three antibiotics and a corticosteroid:

* **Polymyxin B, Neomycin, and Bacitracin:** These are antibiotics that work by killing bacteria that may be causing the skin infection.  They each target bacteria in slightly different ways, increasing the effectiveness of the combination.
* **Hydrocortisone:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid) that reduces inflammation and itching. This helps to soothe the skin and control the symptoms associated with infection.

By combining these components, the medication offers both infection control and symptom relief.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with known allergies to any of the components (polymyxin B, neomycin, bacitracin, or hydrocortisone) should not use this medication.
* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:**  Consult a doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. While generally considered safe for topical use,  potential risks should be weighed against the benefits.
* **Children:** Use should always be under a physician's supervision.
* **Large or Deep Wounds:** This medication is not intended for treatment of deep wounds, severe burns, or extensive skin infections.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Although topical application minimizes systemic interaction, itâ€™s best to inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, both oral and topical.
* **Long-Term Use:** Prolonged use can lead to skin thinning, therefore, it is advisable to use it for the shortest period possible as directed by your physician.
