# Polymyxin B + Neomycin + Bacitracin + Hydrocortisone

**Generic Name:** Polymyxin B Sulfate-Neomycin Sulfate-Bacitracin Zinc-Hydrocortisone Acetate Ointment

**Usage:** This combination ointment is a topical antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medication used to treat a variety of bacterial skin infections, particularly those with inflammation. It's often used for minor burns, cuts, scrapes, and skin irritations accompanied by infection.  The specific bacteria it's effective against are Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.  However, its use is largely restricted to superficial infections.  **It is crucial to note that this medication should only be used as directed by a doctor.**  Self-treating can lead to complications or resistance.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, itching, or irritation at the application site.  Skin dryness.
* **Less Common:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing). Skin thinning or discoloration (with prolonged use).
* **Rare but Serious:** Systemic absorption of the antibiotics, leading to kidney problems or hearing loss (especially with extensive use or damaged skin).

**How it Works:**

* **Polymyxin B and Bacitracin:** These are antibiotics that kill bacteria by disrupting their cell membranes. Polymyxin B is effective against Gram-negative bacteria, while Bacitracin works against Gram-positive bacteria.
* **Neomycin:** Another antibiotic, also effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis.
* **Hydrocortisone:** A corticosteroid, it reduces inflammation and itching, helping to soothe irritated skin.
