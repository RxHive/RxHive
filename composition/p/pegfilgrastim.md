# Pegfilgrastim
### Generic Name
Pegfilgrastim

### Usage
Pegfilgrastim is a medication primarily used to reduce the risk of infection, specifically febrile neutropenia (fever caused by low white blood cell count), in patients with non-myeloid cancers undergoing chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy often suppresses the bone marrow's ability to produce neutrophils, a type of white blood cell crucial for fighting infection. Pegfilgrastim stimulates the bone marrow to produce more neutrophils, thus protecting patients from potentially life-threatening infections.  

A secondary, albeit crucial, use of Pegfilgrastim is in the treatment of acute radiation syndrome's hematopoietic subsyndrome.  This syndrome occurs after exposure to high doses of radiation, causing damage to the bone marrow and resulting in a severe drop in blood cell counts. Pegfilgrastim helps stimulate recovery of the bone marrow and increase survival chances in such cases.  It's important to note that Pegfilgrastim is *not* indicated for mobilizing stem cells for transplantation.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  For preventing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, the standard subcutaneous (SubQ) dose is 6 mg once per chemotherapy cycle, starting at least 24 hours after the completion of chemotherapy.  It's crucial to avoid administering Pegfilgrastim within 14 days before and 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.  For acute radiation syndrome, the recommended dose is 6 mg subcutaneously once weekly for two doses, with the first dose given as soon as possible after radiation exposure exceeding 2 Gray (Gy).

**Children:**  The dosage for children varies depending on their weight and is administered subcutaneously:

* Less than 10 kg: 0.1 mg/kg
* 10-20 kg: 1.5 mg
* 21-30 kg: 2.5 mg
* 31-44 kg: 4 mg
* 45 kg or more: 6 mg

The administration schedule mirrors that of adults, with the same timing considerations relative to chemotherapy or radiation exposure.  The on-body injector (OBI) delivery system is not studied in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Forms:** Pegfilgrastim is available as pre-filled syringes for manual subcutaneous injection or as a kit for use with an on-body injector (OBI).  The OBI system delivers the medication over approximately 45 minutes, and detailed instructions for its use are crucial for proper administration.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Generally, no dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, though studies show renal function doesn't significantly affect Pegfilgrastim pharmacokinetics.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Bone pain (ostealgia)
* Limb pain


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Aortitis (inflammation of the aorta)
* Capillary leak syndrome
* Glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation)
* Pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs)
* Splenic rupture (rupture of the spleen)
* Sickle cell crisis (in patients with sickle cell disease)
* Severe hypersensitivity reactions

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Pegfilgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).  It works by stimulating the bone marrow to produce, mature, and release more neutrophils, a type of white blood cell essential for fighting infections.  Compared to filgrastim, Pegfilgrastim has a longer duration of action and reduced renal clearance. This extended effect allows for less frequent administration.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pegfilgrastim is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity (serious allergic reaction) to Pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any component of the formulation, including those sensitive to *Escherichia coli*-derived proteins.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications, such as Belotecan, Pegloticase, and Topotecan, may necessitate dose adjustments or monitoring.  Consult your physician about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Pegfilgrastim may increase the risk of aortitis, capillary leak syndrome, serious allergic reactions, glomerulonephritis, leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), respiratory distress syndrome, and splenic rupture.  It's particularly important to monitor patients with sickle cell disease for the risk of a sickle cell crisis.  Pegfilgrastim should not be used in the period from 14 days before to 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Pegfilgrastim is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  The decision to breastfeed during treatment should involve careful consideration of the benefits and risks to both mother and infant.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Pegfilgrastim administered?**
A: Pegfilgrastim is typically administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection using a pre-filled syringe or an on-body injector.

**Q: How long does it take to work?**
A: The onset of action varies, but Pegfilgrastim generally begins to increase neutrophil counts within a few days.

**Q: How is Pegfilgrastim stored?**
A: Refer to the medication packaging for specific storage instructions. Generally, it should be refrigerated.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on managing a missed dose.  This is particularly crucial for the acute radiation syndrome treatment.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects?**
A: Long-term effects are generally uncommon, but monitoring for potential side effects is essential.  Discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider.
