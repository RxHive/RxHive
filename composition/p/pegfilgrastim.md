# Pegfilgrastim

**Generic Name:** Pegfilgrastim

**Usage:** Pegfilgrastim is a medication used to decrease the risk of infection (specifically neutropenia, a low white blood cell count) that can occur as a side effect of certain cancer chemotherapy treatments. It stimulates the bone marrow to produce more neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that fights infection.  It may also be used to mobilize peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) before collection for autologous stem cell transplantation.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, pegfilgrastim can cause side effects.  Some are common and mild, while others are rare and serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Bone pain:** This is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Muscle aches:** Pain in the muscles.
* **Rash:**  Skin irritation.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Splenomegaly:** Enlargement of the spleen.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** Low platelet count (increased risk of bleeding).
* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild to severe (anaphylaxis).
* **Capillary Leak Syndrome:**  A rare but potentially life-threatening condition involving fluid leakage from blood vessels.
* **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** A serious lung condition.

**This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.**  Report any unusual or concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.

**How it Works:** Pegfilgrastim is a long-acting form of filgrastim (G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor).  It works by binding to receptors on the surface of bone marrow cells, stimulating the production and release of neutrophils into the bloodstream.  The "peg" portion of the name refers to a polyethylene glycol molecule attached to the filgrastim, which extends its duration of action compared to filgrastim.  This means fewer injections are needed.

**FAQs:**

* **How is pegfilgrastim administered?** It's usually given as a single subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.  The timing of the injection is determined by your doctor, typically after your chemotherapy cycle is completed.

* **How long does it take to work?** The effect on neutrophil counts typically begins within 1-2 days of injection, peaking around day 10-14.

* **Are there any drug interactions?**  While there are no significant drug-drug interactions commonly reported, it's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

* **Who shouldn't take pegfilgrastim?** Patients with severe hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim should not use this medication.  Patients with certain types of leukemia should also exercise caution. Your oncologist will assess your suitability.

* **What if I miss a dose?**  Contact your doctor immediately to discuss the missed dose. Do not try to make up for a missed dose without consulting your healthcare provider.
