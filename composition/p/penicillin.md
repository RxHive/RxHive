# Penicillin

**Generic Name:** Penicillin G (There are many forms of penicillin, but Penicillin G is a common example of a generic penicillin.  Other generic names exist depending on the salt form, like Penicillin V Potassium.)

**Usage:** Penicillin G is used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Pneumonia, bronchitis, strep throat
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Cellulitis, impetigo, abscesses
* **Sexually transmitted infections:** Syphilis, gonorrhea (certain strains)
* **Other infections:** Meningitis, endocarditis (in some cases),  and various others.  Specific usage depends on the bacterial pathogen involved.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Mild:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rash (generally mild)
* **Moderate:**  Yeast infections (oral or vaginal), headache, dizziness

**How it Works:** Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  Without a properly functioning cell wall, bacteria are unable to survive.  Different types of penicillin have varying effectiveness against different types of bacteria.
