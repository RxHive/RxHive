# Pneumococcal

It's impossible to provide details on a single "generic Pneumococcal" because "pneumococcal" refers to a type of bacteria, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*,  and not a single drug.  Many different medications target this bacteria.  There are pneumococcal vaccines (like Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23) and antibiotics (like penicillin, amoxicillin, cephalosporins, etc.) used to treat pneumococcal infections.  Each would have its own specifics.

To give you useful information, I need to know *which specific medication* you're interested in.  For example, are you asking about:

* **A pneumococcal vaccine?**  If so, please specify which one (Prevnar 13, Pneumovax 23, etc.).
* **An antibiotic used to treat a pneumococcal infection?** If so, please specify the antibiotic (e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone).


Once you provide the specific medication, I can give you the details in the format you requested.
