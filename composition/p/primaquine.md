# Primaquine
### Generic Name
Primaquine

### Usage
Primaquine is primarily used to prevent relapse in individuals with *Plasmodium vivax* malaria.  This type of malaria can lie dormant in the liver and relapse months or even years later. Primaquine targets the dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) of the parasite, preventing future relapses.  While not its primary indication, Primaquine may also be used in the treatment of *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* malaria, often in conjunction with other antimalarial drugs.  Off-label uses include chemoprophylaxis (preventing malaria before travel) and presumptive anti-relapse therapy after leaving a malaria-endemic area.  It has also been used, off-label, in treating *Pneumocystis* pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-infected patients, although other treatments are generally preferred.

### Dosage
Dosage is typically expressed in milligrams of the base drug, not the salt (primaquine phosphate).  Conversion factors are needed to calculate the equivalent amount.

**Adults:**

* **Malaria (relapse prevention):**  15 mg base daily for 14 days, typically combined with chloroquine.  The maximum daily dose is 15 mg base.
* **Malaria (treatment of *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*):** 30 mg base daily for 14 days, usually with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.
* **Chemoprophylaxis (off-label):** 30 mg base daily, starting 1-2 days before travel and continuing for 7 days after leaving the malaria-endemic area.
* **Presumptive anti-relapse therapy (off-label):** 30 mg base daily for 14 days after leaving a malaria-endemic area.  This is usually unnecessary if primary prophylaxis with primaquine or tafenoquine was taken.
* **PCP Treatment (off-label):** 30 mg base daily for 21 days, in combination with clindamycin.  This is an off-label use and not the preferred treatment.


**Children:**

Dosage is typically calculated based on weight (0.8 mg/kg/day) and should not exceed 52.6 mg/day.  The duration varies depending on the indication (e.g., 14 days for relapse prevention).  Always consult a physician for precise pediatric dosing.  Primaquine is not recommended for infants.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal cramps
* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)

Less common but serious side effects:

* Anemia (including potentially life-threatening hemolytic anemia in individuals with G6PD deficiency)
* Methemoglobinemia (a condition where the blood's ability to carry oxygen is reduced)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Prolonged QT interval (on ECG)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Primaquine is an antiprotozoal drug that works by targeting the exoerythrocytic (liver) stages of the malaria parasite, specifically *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*. It disrupts the parasite's mitochondria and DNA, leading to its destruction. In contrast to other antimalarials, it doesn't primarily act on the blood stages of the parasite.


### Precautions
* **G6PD Deficiency:** Primaquine is contraindicated in individuals with severe glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as it can cause potentially life-threatening hemolytic anemia.  Testing for G6PD deficiency is crucial before starting treatment.  Careful monitoring is needed in those with mild to moderate G6PD deficiency.
* **Pregnancy:** Primaquine is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Effective contraception is recommended for females of childbearing potential during and after treatment.  Males whose partners might become pregnant should use condoms during treatment and for 3 months afterward.
* **Other Medications:** Primaquine can interact with numerous other drugs. Consult a physician about potential interactions before using it concurrently with other medications.  Examples of interactions include but are not limited to drugs affecting the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes and other QT-prolonging agents.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the labeling for liver or kidney impairment. Close monitoring is warranted in patients with these conditions.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Primaquine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Primaquine?** A: Store Primaquine at room temperature, away from moisture and light, as directed on the label.
* **Q: Can I take Primaquine with alcohol?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Primaquine, as it may worsen side effects, particularly gastrointestinal distress.  Consult your physician if you have concerns.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects of Primaquine on preventing relapse vary but may take some time to fully prevent any future episodes of malaria.  Consult your doctor regarding the timing of treatment.
* **Q: Is Primaquine safe for everyone?** A: No.  Primaquine is contraindicated in certain groups (pregnant women, those with severe G6PD deficiency), and precautions are necessary for others (individuals with liver or kidney problems). Always consult a healthcare provider before using this medication.
