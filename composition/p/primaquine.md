# Primaquine

**Generic Name:** Primaquine

**Usage:** Primaquine is an antimalarial drug used to prevent and treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium ovale*.  It is crucial to note that primaquine *only* targets the liver stages of these parasites (hypnozoites), which are responsible for relapses. It does *not* effectively treat the blood stages of malaria, so it's almost always used in combination with other antimalarial medications, such as chloroquine or tafenoquine, to address the blood stages.  It is also sometimes used to prevent *P. falciparum* malaria in certain situations, but this is less common and requires careful consideration due to the risk of G6PD deficiency (see below).

**Side Effects:** Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, and dizziness.  More serious, although rare, side effects can include:

* **Hemolytic anemia:** This is a serious risk, particularly in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.  G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition affecting primarily males, and testing for it is essential before prescribing primaquine. Hemolytic anemia involves the destruction of red blood cells, leading to fatigue, jaundice, and shortness of breath.
* **Methaemoglobinaemia:** This condition involves an increase in methaemoglobin in the blood, which reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, headache, and bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis).
* **Gastrointestinal issues:** More severe than the mild nausea and vomiting mentioned above, these can include diarrhea and abdominal pain.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions, ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis, can occur.

**How it Works:** Primaquine works by inhibiting parasite growth within the liver.  It's a different class of antimalarial medication than those targeting the blood stages.  Specifically, it targets the hypnozoites of *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*, preventing relapses that can occur months or even years after the initial infection. The mechanism involves the production of reactive oxygen species that damage the parasite.

**FAQs:**

* **Who should not take Primaquine?**  Individuals with known G6PD deficiency should avoid primaquine.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should generally avoid primaquine unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, as it can cross the placental barrier and enter breast milk.  Individuals with severe liver or kidney disease should also exercise caution and may require dosage adjustments or alternative treatments.
* **How long do I need to take Primaquine?** The duration of treatment depends on the specific reason for prescription, and it's crucial to follow the doctor's instructions precisely.  The treatment course is usually relatively short, but it must be completed even if symptoms improve.
* **What are the interactions with other drugs?**  Primaquine can interact with several medications, including other antimalarials, some antidepressants, and certain pain relievers.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones such as jaundice, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention.  Mild side effects, such as nausea, may be managed with simple measures like taking the medication with food.
* **Is a G6PD test required?** Yes, a G6PD test is essential before starting primaquine treatment to avoid the risk of hemolytic anemia.
