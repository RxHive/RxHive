# Phenindamine
### Generic Name
Phenindamine

### Usage
Phenindamine is a sedating antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies and the common cold.  These symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itching, watery eyes, hives, and rashes.  It's important to note that phenindamine is no longer widely available in many markets.

### Dosage

* Oral (as tartrate): 25 mg every 4-6 hours.  The maximum daily dose is 150 mg.

**Pediatric Dosage (Allergic Conditions):**

* Children under 6 years old:  Use is generally avoided.
* Children 6 years and older: Oral (as tartrate): 12.5 mg every 4-6 hours. The maximum daily dose is 75 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The safety and efficacy of phenindamine have not been established for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Therefore, dosage adjustments for these populations are not recommended.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dry mouth

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Visual disturbances
* Loss of appetite
* Difficulty breathing
* Hypersensitive reactions

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above as potentially serious, stop taking phenindamine and contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Phenindamine works by antagonizing (blocking) the effects of histamine. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions, causing many of the uncomfortable symptoms. By blocking histamine's action at H1-receptor sites, phenindamine reduces the intensity of these allergic reactions and the associated tissue damage.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Phenindamine should not be used by individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity to phenindamine or other antihistamines.
* Concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
* Severe or uncontrolled high blood pressure.
* Severe coronary artery disease.
* Infants and neonates.
* Elderly patients (use with extreme caution).


**Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using phenindamine in patients with:

* Narrow-angle glaucoma.
* Gastrointestinal ulcers.
* Urinary retention.
* Hypertension, heart disease, or respiratory diseases.
* Hyperthyroidism.
* A history of convulsions.
* Pregnancy or lactation (safety not fully established).


**Drug Interactions:**  Phenindamine can cause additive central nervous system (CNS) depression when taken with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, hypnotics, opioid analgesics, anxiolytic sedatives, neuroleptics, and alcohol. Concomitant use should be avoided.


### FAQs

A: It is crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking before starting phenindamine.  Some medications, particularly CNS depressants, can interact dangerously.

**Q: How long will it take before I feel the effects of phenindamine?**

A: The onset of action varies from person to person, but you should generally experience symptom relief within a reasonable timeframe after taking the medication.
