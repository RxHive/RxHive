# Psoralen

**Generic Name:** Psoralen (various forms exist, including 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP))

**Usage:** Psoralen is used in conjunction with ultraviolet A (UVA) light therapy, a treatment called PUVA (psoralen plus UVA) therapy.  This combination is primarily used to treat:

* **Psoriasis:** A chronic skin condition causing red, itchy, scaly patches.
* **Vitiligo:** A condition causing loss of skin pigment.
* **Mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma):** A type of skin cancer.
* **Atopic dermatitis (eczema):** An inflammatory skin condition.
* **Other skin conditions:**  Less commonly, it may be used for other skin disorders unresponsive to other treatments.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects include:

* **Sunburn:**  Increased sensitivity to sunlight is a significant risk.
* **Nausea:**  Especially after oral administration.
* **Vomiting:**  Especially after oral administration.
* **Headache:**  Commonly reported.
* **Skin rash:**  Allergic reactions are possible.
* **Eye irritation:**  Protection from UVA light is crucial.
* **Premature aging of the skin:**  Long-term use increases the risk of wrinkles and other signs of aging.
* **Increased risk of skin cancer:**  A significant long-term risk, especially with frequent PUVA treatments.  This includes melanoma.
* **Hyperpigmentation:**  Darkening of the skin.
* **Dry skin:**  Commonly reported.
* **Itching:**  Commonly reported.


**How it Works:** Psoralen is a photosensitizing drug. When taken orally or applied topically, it binds to DNA in skin cells. Upon exposure to UVA light, this psoralen-DNA complex forms cross-links, inhibiting cell growth and division.  This process slows down the rapid cell turnover that characterizes conditions like psoriasis and helps to normalize skin cell function.  The exact mechanism by which it helps in conditions like vitiligo is not fully understood but is believed to involve stimulating pigment production.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does PUVA therapy last?** A:  The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition and response, ranging from weeks to months.

* **Q: Are there alternatives to PUVA therapy?** A: Yes, many other treatments exist for psoriasis, vitiligo, and other skin conditions.  Your doctor will discuss the best option for you based on your individual circumstances.

* **Q: What precautions should I take during and after PUVA therapy?** A: Avoid direct sunlight for several days after treatment. Wear protective clothing and sunscreen with high SPF.  Use special protective eyewear during UVA exposure.

* **Q: Can I use tanning beds instead of UVA light?** A: No, tanning beds are not safe substitutes for the controlled UVA light used in PUVA therapy.

* **Q:  What are the long-term risks of PUVA therapy?** A: The main long-term risks are an increased risk of skin cancer (including melanoma) and premature aging of the skin.  These risks are influenced by the total cumulative dose of PUVA.
