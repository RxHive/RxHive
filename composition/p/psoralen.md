# Psoralen
### Generic Name
Psoralen

### Usage
Psoralens are a class of naturally occurring compounds primarily used in a specialized treatment called photochemotherapy, or PUVA (psoralen plus ultraviolet A) therapy.  This therapy combines the oral or topical application of psoralen with exposure to long-wavelength ultraviolet A (UVA) light.  The primary use of this combination is to treat severe, chronic psoriasis that hasn't responded to other treatments.  While less common, it may also be considered for other skin conditions like vitiligo (loss of skin pigment).  It's crucial to understand that PUVA therapy is not a first-line treatment and is only used under strict medical supervision due to its potential side effects.

### Dosage
Dosage regimens for psoralen in PUVA therapy vary significantly depending on several factors including the specific psoralen used (different psoralens have different potencies), the patient's skin type, the severity of the condition, and the chosen treatment protocol (different protocols exist in the US, Europe, and other regions).  There isn't a single universal dosage.

**Adult Dosage (PUVA):**  Dosage is determined individually by a physician and is highly individualized. The treatment involves a gradual increase in UVA exposure. Dosages are usually expressed in terms of the UVA dose administered (e.g., J/cmÂ²), and the psoralen dose is adjusted to achieve the desired therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects.  Examples of variations in protocols include:

* **US Protocol (Oral):**  Starting doses are lower and carefully titrated upward based on the patient's response, usually aiming for a certain level of erythema (redness).
* **European Protocol (Oral):** This approach also involves careful titration based on the patient's minimum phototoxic dose (MPD), the lowest dose that produces a noticeable reaction.
* **Indian Protocol (Oral):**  This may utilize higher starting doses than other protocols, again adjusted based on the individual's response.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The use of psoralen in PUVA therapy is contraindicated in children. The safety and efficacy haven't been established in this population.

**Topical Dosage:** Topical psoralen may also be used in combination with UVA, but dosage instructions are specific to the formulation and will be provided by the prescribing physician.

**Important Note:**  Precise dosage and administration instructions are always determined and supervised by a qualified dermatologist or physician experienced in PUVA therapy.  Self-medication is extremely dangerous.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of PUVA therapy include:

* Erythema (redness of the skin)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Nausea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin pain

Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Severe skin reactions (e.g., drug eruption, contact allergy)
* Bronchial reactions (wheezing, shortness of breath)
* Xerosis (dry skin)
* Hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)
* Photoaging (premature aging of the skin)
* Hypopigmentation (loss of skin pigment)
* Increased risk of skin cancer (long-term risk)
* Cataracts (eye problems)
* other systemic effects.

Any significant or persistent side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Psoralens work by interacting with DNA.  When activated by UVA light, psoralens bind to DNA, forming a cross-link that inhibits DNA replication and cell growth. This effect primarily targets rapidly dividing skin cells, which are frequently involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and other hyperproliferative skin conditions.  By slowing the growth of these cells, PUVA therapy can help reduce the inflammation and scaling associated with psoriasis.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Psoralen is contraindicated (absolutely shouldn't be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to psoralens, individuals with a history of skin cancer, and children.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with liver impairment, photosensitivity, a history of allergies, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Psoralen can interact with certain medications; therefore, it is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Sun Exposure:** Patients undergoing PUVA therapy should strictly avoid direct sunlight or other sources of UV radiation for a period of time after treatment (usually 24 hours).  Protective measures, such as sunscreen and protective clothing, should be used even when indoors.
* **Regular Monitoring:** Regular monitoring, including eye examinations, is usually required during PUVA treatment to detect any potential long-term side effects.

### FAQs
* **Q: How long does PUVA therapy take to work?** A:  The response to PUVA therapy varies, and improvement may take several weeks or months of treatment.
* **Q: How often are PUVA treatments given?** A: The frequency of PUVA treatments is determined individually by the doctor and may vary.
* **Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with PUVA therapy?** A: Yes, long-term risks include an increased risk of skin cancer and cataract development. Regular monitoring is essential.
* **Q: Can I use sunscreen during PUVA therapy?** A:  You should strictly follow your doctor's instructions about sunscreen use.  Sunscreen use is generally not advisable during the immediate period before and after PUVA treatment.
* **Q: How is psoralen stored?** A: Always follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication. Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
