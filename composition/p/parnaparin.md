# Parnaparin
### Generic Name
Parnaparin

### Usage

Parnaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) used primarily to prevent blood clots (thromboembolic events).  Its main use is in the prophylaxis (prevention) of blood clots, particularly following surgery, especially in patients undergoing orthopedic or other high-risk procedures. It's also employed in the treatment of various thromboembolic disorders, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein), and postphlebitic syndrome (symptoms after a DVT).  In some cases, it may be used in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage of Parnaparin is highly dependent on the specific condition being treated and the patient's risk factors. It's usually administered subcutaneously (under the skin) and measured in anti-Xa International Units (IU).

* **Thromboembolic event prophylaxis (low-risk surgery):** 3200 IU two hours before surgery, then 3200 IU daily for 7 days.
* **Thromboembolic event prophylaxis (high-risk surgery):** 4250 IU twelve hours before surgery, 4250 IU twelve hours after surgery, then 4250 IU daily for at least 10 days.  (Note: Optimal dosing in high-risk patients may need further adjustment.)
* **Treatment of various thromboembolic disorders:** 3200 IU or 4250 IU daily for 1-3 months.
* **Peripheral arterial occlusive disease:** 6400 IU daily for 6-8 months.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Parnaparin in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose reductions might be necessary in patients with kidney problems (renal impairment).  Monitoring of plasma anti-Xa activity is crucial in such cases.  Specific adjustments for liver impairment aren't detailed in the manufacturer's information.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Pain and burning at the injection site
* Injection-site hematoma (bruising)

Less common, but more serious side effects:

* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hematoma (bruising) at other sites
* Spinal hematoma (bleeding in the spinal canal), potentially leading to paralysis.


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

### How it Works

Parnaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin.  It works by binding to antithrombin III, a natural protein in the blood that inhibits clotting factors. This enhanced inhibition of factor Xa (a key clotting factor) prevents the formation of blood clots.  Parnaparin's effect on factor Xa is more pronounced than its effect on thrombin (another important clotting factor), which is a key difference from unfractionated heparin.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Parnaparin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to Parnaparin or other LMWHs, cerebral aneurysm, active bleeding (except disseminated intravascular coagulation), and severe, uncontrolled hypertension.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients with a recent history of childbirth or lumbar puncture have an increased risk of spinal hematoma.  Concomitant use with other anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, or drugs that increase bleeding risk significantly elevates the chance of bleeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Parnaparin interacts with numerous medications. Concurrent use with anticoagulants, fibrinolytics, vitamin K derivatives, platelet aggregation inhibitors (e.g., aspirin, NSAIDs), SSRIs, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids increases the risk of bleeding.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Parnaparin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Parnaparin?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided with your medication.  Generally, LMWHs should be refrigerated.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Parnaparin?** A:  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol during Parnaparin therapy as it can increase the risk of bleeding.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical help if you experience symptoms like hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or a rapid heartbeat.
* **Q:  How long will I need to take Parnaparin?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your condition and response to therapy. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
