# Parnaparin

**Generic Name:** Parnaparin sodium

**Usage:** Parnaparin sodium is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) used to:

* **Prevent blood clots (thrombosis) in the legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) and lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE) after certain types of surgery.**  This is often referred to as prophylaxis.
* **Treat existing blood clots in the legs (DVT) and lungs (PE).**  This is often referred to as treatment.
* **Prevent blood clots in patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).**
* **Prevent blood clots in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).**


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, parnaparin sodium can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most common and serious side effect.  It can range from minor bruising to severe, life-threatening internal bleeding.
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, bruising, swelling, redness, or discoloration at the injection site.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** A decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, increasing the risk of bleeding.  This is rare but serious.
* **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT):** A rare but serious condition where the body develops antibodies against heparin, leading to a paradoxical increase in clotting and a further decrease in platelets.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** Parnaparin sodium is an anticoagulant, meaning it prevents blood clots from forming. It works by:

* **Inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa:** These are proteins in the blood that are essential for blood clot formation.  By inhibiting them, parnaparin sodium prevents the blood from clotting too easily.
* **Increasing the activity of antithrombin III:** This is a natural protein in the blood that helps to prevent clotting. Parnaparin sodium enhances its activity.
