# Prednisolone (Topical)
### Generic Name
Prednisolone (Topical)

### Usage

Prednisolone topical is a corticosteroid used to relieve inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions (corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses).  Its primary use is in managing skin inflammation and itching.  Importantly, it also has applications in treating inflammatory bowel diseases, specifically post-radiation proctitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease affecting the rectum.  In these cases, it's administered rectally via suppositories, enemas, or foam.  The topical form is strictly for skin conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (Topical):** Cream (0.3%) or lotion (0.25%) should be applied 1-4 times daily to the affected area. The exact frequency depends on the severity of the condition and the response to treatment.

* **Post-radiation proctitis (Rectal):**  One 5mg suppository twice daily (after a morning bowel movement and at bedtime). Treatment continues as long as there's progressive clinical improvement.

* **Crohn's disease (Rectal):** One 20mg enema at bedtime for 2-4 weeks, or one 5mg suppository twice daily (as with post-radiation proctitis). Treatment continues only if there's progressive clinical improvement.  Discontinue if there's no adequate response.

* **Ulcerative colitis (Rectal):** One 20mg enema at bedtime for 2-4 weeks, one 20mg metered dose foam once or twice daily for 2 weeks (potentially extended to 4 weeks with improvement), or one 5mg suppository twice daily (as above). Again, continued use depends on progressive improvement, and treatment should stop if there’s insufficient response.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

For Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents, the rectal suppository dosage is the same as for adults.  However, pediatric use of topical formulations requires careful monitoring and consideration of potential growth effects. Specific dosage adjustments for children with skin conditions must be determined by a physician based on age, weight and the severity of the condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment;  use in these cases requires careful monitoring and caution from a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include, but are not limited to:

* **Skin:** Burning sensation, itching, skin thinning, redness, acne, striae (stretch marks), allergic contact dermatitis.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, increased appetite, peptic ulcers (rare but serious).
* **Endocrine:**  Fluid retention, weight gain, changes in menstrual cycle (women), adrenal suppression (long-term use).
* **Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, insomnia, mood changes (anxiety, depression).
* **Ocular:** Increased eye pressure (glaucoma), cataracts (long-term use).
* **Other:**  Increased susceptibility to infection.

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:  osteoporosis, pathological fractures, muscle weakness,  psychological disturbances (psychosis, mania), high blood pressure, and cardiovascular events.


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid (a type of steroid). It works by suppressing the immune system and reducing inflammation.  It acts on cells involved in the inflammatory response, decreasing the production of substances that cause swelling, redness, and itching.  For topical use, this reduces local inflammation in the skin.  For rectal administration, the medication targets inflammation in the lining of the rectum and colon.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Prednisolone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, active untreated infections (especially fungal or viral skin infections for topical application), or certain rectal conditions (e.g., traumatized mucosa, intestinal obstruction).  It should not be used in conjunction with oral or IV corticosteroid therapy.  Specific contraindications exist for topical vs. rectal use.
* **Interactions:** Prednisolone may interact with several medications.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of prednisolone during pregnancy is unknown.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is warranted during breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in patients with heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, liver or kidney disease, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis.  In children, long-term use can affect growth.  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of effect varies depending on the condition and route of administration. Topical applications may show improvement within days, while rectal applications might take longer to show significant effects in managing bowel inflammation.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A:  No, abrupt discontinuation, especially after prolonged use, can lead to adrenal insufficiency.  Dosage reduction should always be gradual and under medical supervision.

* **Q: Can I use it if I have an infection?** A: No. Prednisolone suppresses the immune system, making you more vulnerable to infections.  Treatment of any infection should occur before starting prednisolone.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store prednisolone as directed on the product label. Generally, this means keeping it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Is it addictive?** A: Prednisolone itself isn't considered addictive in the same way as opioids, but prolonged use can lead to dependence, meaning the body becomes accustomed to its presence and withdrawal symptoms may occur upon discontinuation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it’s almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.  Consult your healthcare provider if you have concerns about missed doses.
