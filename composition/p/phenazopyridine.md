# Phenazopyridine

**Generic Name:** Phenazopyridine

**Usage:** Phenazopyridine is used to temporarily relieve the pain and burning sensation caused by urinary tract infections (UTIs).  It is an analgesic and urinary tract anesthetic, meaning it numbs the urinary tract.  **Important Note:** It does *not* treat the underlying infection itself; antibiotics are needed for that.  Phenazopyridine is typically used for only a short period (1-2 days) while waiting for the antibiotic to take effect.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common Side Effects:**  These are usually mild and may include: orange-red or reddish-brown discoloration of urine (harmless), headache, stomach upset, nausea.
* **Less Common but More Serious Side Effects:**  These are rarer but require medical attention if they occur:  allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing),  jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), anemia (low red blood cell count).  In rare instances, it can cause methemoglobinemia (a serious blood disorder where the blood can't carry enough oxygen).

**How it Works:**

Phenazopyridine works by numbing the lining of the urinary tract, thus reducing the pain and burning associated with inflammation caused by UTIs.  It's thought to exert this effect by binding to and blocking sodium channels, affecting nerve impulse transmission.
