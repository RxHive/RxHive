# Phenazopyridine
### Generic Name
Phenazopyridine

### Usage
Phenazopyridine is used to temporarily relieve the symptoms of pain, burning, urgency, and frequency associated with irritation of the urinary tract.  These symptoms often occur due to urinary tract infections (UTIs), injury to the urinary tract, surgery, or the insertion of medical devices like catheters.  It's crucial to understand that phenazopyridine only treats the *symptoms* and doesn't address the underlying cause of the urinary tract irritation.  It's most effective when used in conjunction with antibiotics to treat the infection, if one is present.  It's not a substitute for proper diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Over-the-counter (OTC):** Typically, two 95-100mg tablets are taken three times daily for up to two days.  Always follow the instructions on the OTC product label.
* **Prescription:**  A doctor may prescribe 200mg three times daily for two days, often alongside an antibiotic for a UTI.  Dosage and duration may vary depending on the individual's needs and the severity of their symptoms.

**Children:**

* The safety and effectiveness of phenazopyridine in children under 6 years old haven't been established.
* For children aged 6-12 years: The typical dose is 12 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into three doses given every eight hours.  This should only be used for a maximum of two days alongside antibiotic treatment for a UTI.
* For children aged over 12 years: The dosage is usually the same as for adults (100-200 mg three times a day), and should be limited to two days when used with antibiotics to treat a UTI.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Liver disease:**  Phenazopyridine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with severe liver disease. For mild to moderate liver impairment, dosage adjustments aren't specified in the manufacturer's labeling, so it's crucial to consult a doctor.
* **Kidney disease:** Phenazopyridine is contraindicated in individuals with kidney disease.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Stomach cramps

**Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in less than 1% of users, based on post-marketing surveillance and case reports):**

* Acute kidney failure
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Methemoglobinemia (a condition where the blood's ability to carry oxygen is reduced)
* Skin pigmentation changes
* Skin rash
* Vertigo

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.


### How it Works

Phenazopyridine is an azo dye that acts as a local anesthetic in the urinary tract. Its exact mechanism of pain relief isn't fully understood, but it's believed to numb the irritated tissues, thus reducing pain and discomfort.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Phenazopyridine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, severe liver disease, severe kidney disease, and severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis (kidney infection) during pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Phenazopyridine can interact with certain medications, particularly those that can cause methemoglobinemia. Discuss any other medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before using phenazopyridine.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While categorized as Pregnancy Category B (meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking), phenazopyridine should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. It's unclear whether the drug is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised.
* **G6PD Deficiency:**  Use with caution in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as it could increase the risk of hemolytic anemia.
* **Elderly:** Use with caution in older adults due to their increased risk of adverse reactions.
