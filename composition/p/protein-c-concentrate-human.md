# Protein C Concentrate (Human)
### Generic Name
Protein C Concentrate (Human)

### Usage
Protein C concentrate (human) is primarily used in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency.  Its main purpose is to prevent and treat venous thrombosis (blood clots in veins) and purpura fulminans (a severe, life-threatening condition characterized by widespread blood clotting in small blood vessels).  This medication is crucial because individuals with severe congenital protein C deficiency lack sufficient amounts of protein C, a natural anticoagulant, leaving them at a significantly higher risk of developing these serious conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors such as the severity of protein C deficiency, the patient's weight, and their response to treatment.  It's administered intravenously (IV).

* **Acute episode/short-term prophylaxis:**  The initial dose is typically 100-120 units/kg.  Subsequent doses of 60-80 units/kg are given every 6 hours, adjusting the dose to maintain peak protein C activity at 100%.  A maintenance dose of 45-60 units/kg every 6 or 12 hours may be necessary to sustain trough protein C activity above 25%.

* **Long-term prophylaxis:**  A maintenance dose of 45-60 units/kg every 12 hours is usually recommended to keep trough protein C activity above 25%.

**Children:** Dosage is also individualized based on weight and clinical condition.  The approach mirrors that of adults, with the initial dose being 100-120 units/kg, followed by adjustments to maintain peak and trough activity levels similar to adults.


**Important Note:**  Dosage and duration of therapy are determined based on various patient-specific factors, including age, overall health, severity of deficiency, protein C activity levels, and individual pharmacokinetic profile (how the body processes the drug). Higher peak levels might be needed for patients at increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., due to infection, trauma, or surgery). If transitioning to oral anticoagulants, protein C replacement should continue until stable anticoagulation is achieved.  Oral anticoagulants should be initiated at a low dose and gradually increased.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  The frequency of side effects isn't precisely defined in available literature.

* **Serious (but less common):** Major hemorrhage (severe bleeding), hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions).

* **Less frequent (post-marketing and/or case reports):** Diaphoresis (excessive sweating), injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), restlessness.

**If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, immediately consult your healthcare provider.**

### How it Works

Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein naturally produced in the liver.  In its activated form (APC), it acts as a powerful anticoagulant, primarily by inactivating factors V and VIII (clotting factors). This inactivation reduces thrombin formation (a key step in blood clot formation). APC also has profibrinolytic effects, meaning it can help break down existing blood clots.  By supplying protein C to individuals deficient in this protein, the concentrate helps restore the body's natural anticoagulant mechanisms and prevent or treat thrombotic events.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Currently, there are no absolute contraindications listed in the manufacturer's labeling.

* **Increased Risk:** Individuals with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or those with a history of hypersensitivity reactions are at increased risk of complications.

* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution in patients with renal impairment (kidney problems) or those on a sodium-restricted diet due to potential sodium overload.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Protein C concentrate can interact with various medications, including other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and some herbal remedies.  These interactions can increase the risk of bleeding.  Thorough discussion with a healthcare professional is necessary to manage potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Protein C concentrate is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. The decision to breastfeed while using this medication requires careful consideration of the potential risks to the infant, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of treatment for the mother.
