# Palonosetron
### Generic Name
Palonosetron

### Usage
Palonosetron is primarily used to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or CINV).  It's also used to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery (postoperative nausea and vomiting or PONV).  The drug's effectiveness lies in its ability to block the action of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in triggering these types of nausea and vomiting.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **CINV Prevention (Intravenous):** 0.25 mg infused over 30 seconds, starting about 30 minutes before chemotherapy begins.
* **CINV Prevention (Oral):** 0.5 mg capsule approximately one hour before chemotherapy.
* **PONV Prevention (Intravenous):** 0.075 mg infused over 10 seconds, immediately before the start of anesthesia.

**Children:**

* **CINV Prevention (Intravenous):**  20 mcg/kg as a single dose infused over 15 minutes, beginning approximately 30 minutes before chemotherapy.  The maximum dose is 1500 mcg.  Dosage for adolescents 17 years and older is the same as for adults.
* **CINV Prevention (Oral):** 0.5 mg single dose before chemotherapy.

**Important Note:**  Palonosetron's safety and effectiveness have not been established for children under 1 year old or for PONV prevention in children.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are generally not necessary. Always follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Anxiety
* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Flatulence (gas)
* Itching (pruritus)
* QT prolongation on ECG (requires monitoring)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Increased serum ALT and AST levels (liver enzymes)
* Weakness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (affecting less than 1% of patients):**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention if experienced.

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition)

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Palonosetron is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of serotonin at its receptors in the brain and in the gut. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that can trigger nausea and vomiting. By blocking these receptors, palonosetron prevents the signals that would normally cause nausea and vomiting from reaching the vomiting center in the brain.  This action is effective both peripherally (in the gut) and centrally (in the brain's vomiting center).

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** Palonosetron is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to palonosetron or any of its components.
* **Cardiac Considerations:**  Palonosetron can affect the electrical activity of the heart, potentially prolonging the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG).  This is especially important for patients with pre-existing heart conditions or those at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.  Careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Serotonin Syndrome:**  There's a risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, particularly when palonosetron is used with other serotonergic medications.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Palonosetron may worsen constipation; caution is warranted in patients with pre-existing constipation, intestinal obstruction, or electrolyte imbalances.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Palonosetron is classified as pregnancy category B.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown. Consult with a healthcare professional to weigh the benefits and risks before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take palonosetron with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking, as palonosetron may interact with certain drugs.
* **Q: How should I store palonosetron?** A: Store according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Is palonosetron habit-forming?** A: No, palonosetron is not a controlled substance and does not have addictive properties.
* **Q:  What if I experience severe side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unexpected side effects.
