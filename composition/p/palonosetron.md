# Palonosetron

**Generic Name:** Palonosetron Hydrochloride

**Usage:** Palonosetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (cancer treatment).  It's particularly effective against delayed nausea and vomiting (occurring more than 24 hours after chemotherapy).  It may be used alone or in combination with other antiemetic medications.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, palonosetron can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** This is a relatively frequent side effect.
* **Constipation:**  This can be a significant issue for some patients.
* **Dizziness:** This can affect balance and coordination.
* **Fatigue/Tiredness:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Dry mouth:**  Decreased saliva production.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Though less common, it can cause lightheadedness or fainting.


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **QT prolongation:**  This is a change in the heart's rhythm that can be dangerous in some cases.  Your doctor should monitor you if you have risk factors for heart problems.
* **Allergic reactions:** These can range from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis (a life-threatening emergency).


**How it Works:** Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of serotonin (5-HT3) in the brain and gut.  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in triggering nausea and vomiting, especially in response to chemotherapy. By blocking serotonin receptors, palonosetron helps prevent these signals from reaching the vomiting center in the brain.
