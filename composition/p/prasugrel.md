# Prasugrel
### Generic Name
Prasugrel

### Usage

Prasugrel is a medication belonging to the class of drugs called P2Y12 platelet inhibitors.  Its primary use is to reduce the risk of blood clots and subsequent cardiovascular events in patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS).  ACS encompasses conditions like unstable angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, a heart attack with less severe ECG changes), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, a more severe heart attack).  Prasugrel is specifically used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a procedure that uses a catheter to open blocked coronary arteries.  This is crucial because it helps prevent stent thrombosis (blood clots forming within the stent placed during PCI).

### Dosage

**Adults:**  The dosage of Prasugrel depends on the patient's weight and the specific ACS presentation.

* **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) managed with PCI:**
    * **Loading Dose:** A single 60 mg oral dose is given before PCI, usually along with aspirin and a parenteral anticoagulant (injection). For STEMI with primary PCI, this should be given as early as possible after diagnosis. For NSTEMI or unstable angina, it’s administered after angiography confirms the need for PCI. If PCI is not performed, an alternative P2Y12 inhibitor is recommended.
    * **Maintenance Dose:** Following the loading dose, the daily maintenance dose is typically 10 mg orally for patients weighing 60 kg or more.  For patients weighing less than 60 kg, the maintenance dose is 5 mg daily.  The maintenance dose begins the day after PCI.  For patients of East Asian descent, a reduction to 5 mg daily after 30 days may be considered to decrease bleeding risk due to their higher sensitivity to the drug.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Prasugrel in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B).  Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is usually necessary, but caution is advised in patients with moderate to severe kidney impairment, as they are at increased risk of bleeding.  Prasugrel is not removed by hemodialysis.
* **Switching from other P2Y12 inhibitors:**  Specific dosing instructions exist for transitioning from other antiplatelet agents like clopidogrel or ticagrelor; consult the prescribing information for details.

### How it Works

Prasugrel is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form in the body. The active metabolite blocks P2Y12 receptors on platelets, preventing their activation and aggregation (clumping together).  This inhibition of platelet function reduces the formation of blood clots, which is crucial in preventing cardiovascular events in patients with ACS.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), active pathological bleeding, severe hepatic impairment, or hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Increased Risk of Bleeding:** Prasugrel significantly increases the risk of bleeding, especially when used with other anticoagulants, NSAIDs, or fibrinolytics. Close monitoring for bleeding is essential.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use caution in patients with moderate to severe kidney disease due to increased bleeding risk.
* **Elderly Patients:**  The use of Prasugrel in patients 75 years and older is generally not recommended due to increased risk of bleeding and uncertain benefit.  However, its use might be considered in high-risk situations such as patients with diabetes or a history of MI.
* **Surgery/Procedures:**  Prasugrel should be discontinued several days before elective surgery or procedures to minimize bleeding risks.  The decision to restart Prasugrel after the procedure should be made based on the individual patient's condition and surgical specifics.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Prasugrel is a Category B drug in pregnancy (animal studies showed no harm, but human studies are lacking).  Its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered, weighing potential benefits against potential risks to the infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Prasugrel with other medications?** A:  Use caution when combining Prasugrel with other drugs that increase bleeding risk, such as anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and fibrinolytics.  Consult your doctor before combining Prasugrel with any other medication.

* **Q: How should I store Prasugrel?** A: Store Prasugrel at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Prasugrel without talking to my doctor?** A: No.  Stopping Prasugrel suddenly could increase your risk of a cardiovascular event.  Always discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor.

* **Q:  How long will I need to take Prasugrel?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your individual circumstances and will be determined by your healthcare provider.  It usually involves a period of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) – Prasugrel and aspirin – following PCI, followed by continuation on aspirin alone.
