# Prasugrel

**Generic Name:** Prasugrel

**Usage:** Prasugrel is a prescription medication used to prevent blood clots in patients who have recently had a heart attack or unstable angina (chest pain). It's also used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a procedure to open blocked arteries in the heart.  It's specifically indicated for patients undergoing PCI with a drug-eluting stent.  It is NOT used for stroke prevention.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, prasugrel can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk.  It can range from minor bruising to serious internal bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage).
* **Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count):** This can increase the risk of bleeding.
* **Dyspnea (shortness of breath):**
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Diarrhea:**
* **Abdominal pain:**
* **Rash:**


Serious side effects are less common but can be life-threatening.  Immediately seek medical attention if you experience signs of serious bleeding (e.g., black stools, vomiting blood, unusual bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts).

**How it Works:** Prasugrel is a thienopyridine, a type of antiplatelet medication.  It works by inhibiting the activation of platelets, which are blood cells that clump together to form blood clots. By preventing platelet aggregation, prasugrel reduces the risk of blood clots forming in the arteries, thereby lessening the chance of a heart attack or stroke in at-risk patients.  Specifically, it irreversibly blocks the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor on platelets.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take prasugrel with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking, as interactions can occur.  Some medications, particularly those that increase bleeding risk (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants), should be used with caution or avoided altogether.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.
* **Q: How long do I need to take prasugrel?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on individual needs and your doctor's assessment. It's typically prescribed for a specific period following a heart attack or PCI.
* **Q: What are the risks of stopping prasugrel suddenly?** A:  Stopping prasugrel abruptly can increase the risk of blood clot formation.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding when and how to discontinue the medication.
* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?** A: Yes, several medications can interact with Prasugrel, increasing the risk of bleeding. This includes other antiplatelet drugs (like aspirin or clopidogrel), anticoagulants (like warfarin), NSAIDs (like ibuprofen or naproxen) and certain other medications.  Discuss all medications with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q:  Is Prasugrel safe for everyone?** A: No.  It's not suitable for everyone, particularly those with a history of bleeding disorders, active bleeding, or those at high risk of bleeding.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.
