# Pixantrone
### Generic Name
Pixantrone

### Usage
Pixantrone is a chemotherapy medication used as a monotherapy (single drug treatment) for adults with aggressive non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas (NHL) that have relapsed or are refractory (not responding to treatment).  This means it's used in patients whose lymphoma has come back after previous treatments or hasn't responded to those treatments.  It's specifically targeted at a particularly aggressive type of lymphoma.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Relapsed or Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin's B-cell Lymphoma):**

Pixantrone is administered intravenously (IV). The typical dosage is 50 mg/m² given on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. This cycle is repeated for up to six cycles, depending on the patient's response and tolerance to the treatment.  The dose is calculated based on the patient's body surface area (m²).

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and effectiveness of Pixantrone have not been established in children under the age of 18.  It should not be used in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild or moderate liver impairment, no specific dosage adjustment is recommended in the manufacturer's labeling, but it should be used with caution. Pixantrone is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is provided for patients with kidney impairment, but caution is advised.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on the severity of side effects.  Dose reductions or treatment delays may be needed if certain blood counts (platelets and neutrophils) fall below specified levels, or if serious non-hematological toxicities (excluding nausea and vomiting) occur.  For significant cardiovascular toxicity, treatment may need to be stopped.  Specific guidelines for dose adjustments should be followed as directed by the prescribing physician.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Lymphopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin discoloration
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Chromaturia (discolored urine)
* Asthenia (weakness or fatigue)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<10% but potentially serious):**

* Neutropenic infections (infections due to low neutrophil count)
* Febrile neutropenia (fever with low neutrophil count)
* Left ventricular dysfunction (problems with the heart's main pumping chamber)
* Congestive heart failure
* Other serious infections, cardiovascular events, or toxicities.


**It is crucial to report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione. It works by interfering with the actions of topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for DNA replication.  It also directly damages DNA, forming adducts (connections between the drug and the DNA) and cross-strand breaks, thus stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Unlike some other similar drugs, Pixantrone produces fewer harmful reactive oxygen species, leading to a reduced risk of certain side effects, particularly cardiovascular toxicity.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Pixantrone or any component of the formulation.
* Immunization with live virus vaccines.
* Profound bone marrow suppression.
* Severe abnormal hepatic (liver) function.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

Pixantrone can increase the risk of myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), cardiotoxicity (heart damage), gastrointestinal toxicity, photosensitivity (sun sensitivity), secondary malignancies (new cancers), infections, and tumor lysis syndrome (a rapid breakdown of cancer cells).

Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or renal impairment. Patients should be closely monitored for these risks.  It is important to discuss any pre-existing conditions with the healthcare provider.


**Other Precautions:**

* Patients of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for six months afterward.
* Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.
* Pixantrone may affect male fertility; male patients should also use contraception and consider sperm banking before treatment.
* Avoid direct sun exposure and use protective measures (sunscreen, clothing).
