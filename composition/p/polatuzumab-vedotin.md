# Polatuzumab vedotin
### Generic Name
Polatuzumab vedotin

### Usage
Polatuzumab vedotin is a type of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) used in the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in adults.  This means it's used for people whose DLBCL has come back after treatment (relapsed) or hasn't responded to previous treatments (refractory).  It's specifically indicated for use after at least two prior therapies, and it's administered in combination with bendamustine and a rituximab product.  The primary use is to target and destroy cancerous B-cells, a type of white blood cell involved in DLBCL.  There are currently no other approved uses for polatuzumab vedotin.

### Dosage
Polatuzumab vedotin is administered intravenously (IV). The typical dose for adults with relapsed or refractory DLBCL is 1.8 mg/kg given once every 21 days for a total of six cycles. This is always given in combination with bendamustine and rituximab.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors like blood counts (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), infusion reactions, and peripheral neuropathy.  Specific adjustments are outlined in the "Dosage Adjustments" section below.  The medication is not approved for use in children.


### Dosage Adjustments:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Mild impairment (slightly elevated liver enzymes) may not require dosage adjustments. However, moderate to severe impairment necessitates avoiding use due to potential increased exposure to the drug's toxic component.
* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for mild to moderate renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.  However, studies indicate minimal impact on pharmacokinetics in individuals with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 30-89 mL/min.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose modifications or treatment interruptions may be needed depending on the severity of side effects such as:
    * **Hematologic toxicity (low blood cell counts):** Dose reductions or interruptions might be implemented for grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (low neutrophils) or thrombocytopenia (low platelets). Growth factor support might be considered.
    * **Infusion reactions:**  The infusion may need to be slowed or stopped depending on the severity of the reaction. In severe cases, the drug may be permanently discontinued.
    * **Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage):** Dose reductions or discontinuation might be considered depending on the severity.  Grade 4 neuropathy leads to immediate discontinuation.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness, pain in hands or feet)
* Diarrhea
* Decreased appetite
* Nausea/vomiting
* Fatigue
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Infusion-related reactions (allergic-type reactions)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) â€“ a rare and serious brain infection
* Severe infections (including sepsis, pneumonia)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Tumor lysis syndrome (a rapid release of substances from dying cancer cells)


**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. Consult your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Polatuzumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate. It consists of an antibody (polatuzumab) that specifically targets the CD79b protein, found on the surface of cancerous B-cells, and a cytotoxic agent (monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE). Once polatuzumab vedotin binds to CD79b, it's taken into the B-cell.  The MMAE is then released, damaging the cell's microtubules, essential components of cell structure and division. This disruption causes the cancer cells to stop dividing and eventually die (apoptosis).


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Polatuzumab vedotin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  The drug can suppress bone marrow function, increasing the risk of infections and bleeding. Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor this.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Polatuzumab vedotin can cause liver damage. Liver function tests should be monitored regularly.
* **Infections:** Increased risk of serious infections, including opportunistic infections, is a significant concern.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:**  Close monitoring for the development of peripheral neuropathy is necessary.
* **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):**  A rare but serious brain infection associated with this drug requires close monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Polatuzumab vedotin can harm a developing fetus. Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment. Breastfeeding is contraindicated during treatment and for at least two months after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Polatuzumab vedotin can interact with other medications. Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I be on Polatuzumab vedotin?** A: The typical treatment course involves six cycles, given every 21 days. Your doctor will determine the duration based on your response to treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately.  They will advise on whether and when to administer the missed dose.

* **Q: How is Polatuzumab vedotin stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication packaging.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor or healthcare provider promptly.  Some side effects are manageable, while others may necessitate dosage adjustments or discontinuation of the drug.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Polatuzumab vedotin?** A: This depends on the side effects experienced. If you feel drowsy, weak, or experience peripheral neuropathy impacting coordination, avoid driving until these effects subside.  Consult your doctor for guidance.
