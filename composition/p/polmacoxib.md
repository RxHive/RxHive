# Polmacoxib

**Generic Name:** Polmacoxib

**Usage:**  Polmacoxib is a non-narcotic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation in dogs. It's specifically indicated for the management of osteoarthritis pain in canine patients.  It's important to note that polmacoxib is *not* approved for use in humans or other animals.

**Side Effects:** Like other NSAIDs, polmacoxib can cause side effects, although the incidence varies.  The most commonly reported side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia (loss of appetite), decreased stool consistency.  More serious gastrointestinal problems, such as ulceration, are possible, though less frequent.
* **Hepatic (Liver):**  Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests).  In rare cases, more severe liver damage can occur.
* **Renal (Kidney):**  Decreased kidney function (detected through blood tests).
* **Other:**  Lethargy, increased thirst/urination.

The severity of side effects can vary depending on the dosage, duration of treatment, and individual animal factors.

**How it Works:** Polmacoxib, like other COX-2 inhibitors, works by selectively inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. COX-2 is involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that contribute to pain and inflammation. By inhibiting COX-2, polmacoxib reduces the production of these inflammatory mediators, leading to pain relief and reduced inflammation.  It's considered to have less impact on COX-1 than some other NSAIDs, which is theoretically associated with a reduced risk of gastrointestinal side effects, although gastrointestinal issues can still occur.
