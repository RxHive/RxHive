# Phenytoin

**Generic Name:** Phenytoin

**Usage:**

Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat and prevent seizures in various epilepsy syndromes.  It's also used to treat certain types of nerve pain (neuralgia) and to prevent migraine headaches in some cases.  Specifically, it's effective against tonic-clonic, partial, and status epilepticus seizures. The use of phenytoin should always be under the guidance of a neurologist or other qualified medical professional.


**Side Effects:**

Phenytoin can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, indigestion
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia (loss of coordination), nystagmus (involuntary eye movement), headache, slurred speech, confusion, cognitive impairment
* **Skin:** Skin rash (ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), hirsutism (increased hair growth)
* **Cardiovascular:** Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias), hypotension (low blood pressure)
* **Hematologic:** Anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* **Other:** Gum hyperplasia (enlarged gums), weight changes, vision changes


**Severe side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reactions)
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior


**How it Works:**

Phenytoin works by slowing down the abnormal electrical activity in the brain that causes seizures.  It does this by blocking sodium channels in nerve cells, reducing the ability of these cells to fire rapidly and uncontrollably. This stabilization of neuronal activity prevents the spread of seizure activity.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I stop taking phenytoin suddenly?** No.  Stopping phenytoin abruptly can lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, including increased seizure frequency and severity.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking phenytoin?**  No. Alcohol can interact with phenytoin, potentially increasing its side effects or decreasing its effectiveness.  It's crucial to avoid alcohol while on this medication.

* **How is phenytoin monitored?**  Blood levels of phenytoin are often monitored to ensure the medication is at a therapeutic level and to minimize side effects.  Regular blood tests are typically required.

* **What are the long-term effects of phenytoin?**  Long-term use of phenytoin can lead to various complications, including bone problems (osteomalacia, osteoporosis), liver damage, and cognitive impairment. Regular monitoring is essential.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double up on doses.

* **Is phenytoin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Phenytoin can cross the placenta and enter breast milk.  The risks and benefits of using phenytoin during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be carefully discussed with a doctor.  Fetal abnormalities have been associated with phenytoin use during pregnancy.
