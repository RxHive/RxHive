# Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine

**Generic Name:** Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine

**Usage:**

Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine is primarily used to prevent and treat malaria, specifically *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria.  It's often used as intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in pregnant women and infants in areas with high malaria transmission.  It's also sometimes used to treat uncomplicated malaria in adults and children, though resistance is a growing concern, limiting its effectiveness in many regions.  **Always consult a healthcare professional before using this medication and follow their prescribed dosage and regimen.**  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Loss of appetite
* Rash
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Bone marrow suppression (leading to anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia)
* Liver damage
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Crystaluria (crystals in the urine)


**How it Works:**

Pyrimethamine and sulphadoxine work synergistically to inhibit the growth and multiplication of the malaria parasite.  Pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme essential for the parasite's DNA synthesis.  Sulphadoxine inhibits dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), another enzyme involved in folate synthesis. By inhibiting these two key enzymes, the drug combination disrupts the parasite's ability to produce folic acid, a crucial vitamin for its survival and replication.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine effective against all types of malaria?** No, its effectiveness is primarily against *Plasmodium falciparum*. It may be less effective against other malaria species.

* **Can I take Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine if I'm pregnant?**  Only under strict medical supervision.  It's sometimes used as IPT during pregnancy in high-transmission areas, but the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed.

* **Can I take Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine if I'm breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor.  While some excretion in breast milk is possible, the benefits may outweigh the risks in certain situations, but this needs to be carefully assessed.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately.  Some side effects can be serious and require medical attention.

* **Why is resistance to Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine increasing?**  Overuse and inappropriate use of the drug have led to the development of resistant malaria parasites.  This is why it's crucial to follow medical guidance and only use this medication as prescribed.

* **Is there an alternative to Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine for malaria treatment?** Yes, several other antimalarial drugs are available.  Your doctor will determine the best treatment option based on your individual circumstances and the prevalence of drug-resistant malaria in your region.
