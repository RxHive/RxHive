# Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine
### Generic Name
Pyrimethamine + Sulphadoxine

### Usage
Pyrimethamine and Sulphadoxine is a combination antimalarial drug primarily used to treat malaria caused by the *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite, especially in areas where chloroquine resistance is prevalent.  It's particularly effective against malaria infections that have developed resistance to other antimalarials.  While its primary use is in treating malaria, it may also be used for the prevention of malaria in some specific situations, although this use is becoming less common due to the emergence of resistant strains.  The decision to use this combination for prevention should always be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.  The combination is not effective against all types of malaria, and its use should be guided by local resistance patterns and expert recommendations.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, the type of malaria being treated, and the specific formulation used.  **Always follow the prescription provided by your doctor.**  There is no single, universally applicable dosage.  

* **Malaria Treatment:**  Dosage regimens are usually calculated based on weight and the specific product used (e.g., FansidarÂ® contains a specific ratio of pyrimethamine to sulphadoxine).  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on these factors. Treatment typically involves a single dose or a course of multiple doses.

* **Oral Administration:** Tablets are the most common oral form.

* **IV Administration:** Pyrimethamine and Sulphadoxine are not typically administered intravenously.  Malaria treatment usually involves oral medications.

* **Children:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower than for adults and is always determined by a physician based on the child's weight and age.  It is crucial to use formulations specifically designed for children.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This combination is generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the developing fetus or infant.  Alternative antimalarial treatments should be considered.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Fatigue

Less common, but serious side effects can include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Blood disorders (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Neurological effects (e.g., seizures)

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works
Pyrimethamine and sulphadoxine work synergistically.  Sulphadoxine inhibits the synthesis of folic acid, a vital component for the parasite's growth and reproduction. Pyrimethamine enhances this effect by blocking dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme also crucial for folic acid metabolism in the malaria parasite. By disrupting folic acid metabolism, the drug combination significantly limits the parasite's ability to multiply and survive, thus treating the malaria infection.


### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with a known allergy to sulphonamides or pyrimethamine should not use this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:** This combination may interact with certain medications, including those that affect the liver or kidneys.  Always inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This combination is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the potential for serious adverse effects.

* **Kidney and Liver Impairment:** Use caution in patients with pre-existing kidney or liver disease, as the medication may be poorly metabolized or excreted. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.

* **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  This combination can rarely cause bone marrow suppression. Regular blood tests might be advised in long-term users or those with pre-existing blood disorders.

* **Folic Acid Deficiency:**  Supplementation with folic acid may be recommended to minimize the risk of developing folic acid deficiency.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication without a prescription?**  A: No. This medication should only be taken under the guidance of a doctor.  Self-medicating can be dangerous.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately for advice.  Do not double the dose to compensate for a missed dose.

* **Q: Are there any alternative treatments for malaria?** A: Yes, there are several other antimalarial drugs available, and the choice of treatment will depend on factors such as the type of malaria, drug resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors.  Your doctor will make the best recommendation for you.
