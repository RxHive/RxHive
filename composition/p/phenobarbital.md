# Phenobarbital
### Generic Name
Phenobarbital

### Usage

Phenobarbital, also known as phenobarbitone or phenobarb, is a barbiturate primarily used as an anticonvulsant to control seizures.  Its main applications are in managing generalized tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus (a life-threatening seizure lasting longer than five minutes), and partial seizures.  While not its primary use, phenobarbital also possesses sedative and hypnotic properties and may be used off-label for sedation before surgery or to treat alcohol withdrawal symptoms.  It's important to note that due to its potential for dependence and other side effects, its use in sedation and alcohol withdrawal is generally considered a last resort, when other, safer options are unavailable.


### Dosage

Dosage of phenobarbital varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (oral, intravenous [IV], or intramuscular [IM]).  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's precise instructions.  The information below should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Sedation:** Oral, IV, or IM administration;  typical daily dose ranges from 30-120 mg, divided into 2-3 doses. The maximum daily dose is generally 400 mg.
* **Status Epilepticus:** IV administration is standard.  Dosage recommendations vary depending on the guideline followed. The American Epilepsy Society recommends it only as a second-line agent after other treatments. The Neurocritical Care Society recommends a loading dose of 20 mg/kg infused at 50-100 mg/minute.  This may be repeated once after 10 minutes, with an additional 5-10 mg/kg if needed.
* **Seizure Maintenance Therapy:** Oral or IV administration; the typical range is 2 mg/kg/day, divided into multiple doses.  Dosage is carefully adjusted based on individual response and blood levels.
* **Alcohol Withdrawal (off-label):** IV administration might involve an initial dose of 260 mg, followed by 130 mg doses as needed.  Dosage tapering is crucial to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is determined by their weight in mg/kg/day.  Specific recommendations vary based on age and the reason for treatment (seizures, sedation, etc.).  Always follow a doctor's exact instructions, as incorrect dosage can be harmful.  Consult your physician or pharmacist for the proper calculation and administration.


**Important Note:** The above dosages represent general guidelines.  Individualized dosing based on clinical response and blood levels is critical, particularly for seizure management.  Close monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential, especially with IV administration, due to the risks of respiratory depression.


### Side Effects

Phenobarbital, like many medications, can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Unsteadiness (ataxia)
* Confusion
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing) â€“ this is a serious side effect, especially with IV administration and can be life-threatening.
* Paradoxical excitement (agitation, restlessness)
* Allergic reactions (skin rash, hives)
* Liver problems (in rare cases)
* Blood disorders
* Dependence (with long-term use)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Phenobarbital is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant.  Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood but involves enhancing the effects of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.  By increasing GABA activity, phenobarbital reduces neuronal excitability, thus suppressing seizures and promoting sedation.  The higher the dose, the greater the CNS depression and anticonvulsant effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Phenobarbital is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to barbiturates or any component of the formulation, severe liver disease, and those with a history of barbiturate abuse.
* **Drug Interactions:** Phenobarbital can interact with many other medications, including other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids), anticoagulants, and some antidepressants. This can either increase or decrease the effectiveness of these drugs, or increase the risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Phenobarbital should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  It crosses the placenta and can cause withdrawal symptoms in newborns.  It's also excreted in breast milk, potentially affecting the infant.
* **Elderly and Children:**  Use caution in elderly patients due to increased sensitivity to the drug's effects.  Children are also more sensitive and require careful dose adjustments based on their weight and age.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **Sudden Withdrawal:**  Abrupt discontinuation after long-term use can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures.  Always taper off the medication under a doctor's supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking phenobarbital?** A:  No. Alcohol significantly enhances the CNS depressant effects of phenobarbital, increasing the risk of respiratory depression and other adverse effects.
* **Q: How should I store phenobarbital?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I stop taking phenobarbital suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can trigger serious withdrawal symptoms, including seizures.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is phenobarbital habit-forming?** A: Yes, phenobarbital is a controlled substance and can be habit-forming with prolonged use.  Long-term use should only be under strict medical supervision.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of phenobarbital?** A:  Long-term use can lead to tolerance, dependence, and cognitive impairment.  Regular monitoring and careful consideration of the benefits and risks are necessary with chronic treatment.
