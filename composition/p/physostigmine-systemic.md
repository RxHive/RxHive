# Physostigmine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Physostigmine (Systemic)

### Usage
Physostigmine (systemic) is primarily used to treat severe anticholinergic toxicity. This occurs when someone is exposed to a high level of anticholinergic substances, leading to symptoms like rapid heart rate, dry mouth, blurred vision, and confusion.  Physostigmine counteracts these effects by boosting the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that anticholinergic substances block.

Secondary uses include reversing the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers after surgery, stimulating intestinal peristalsis (movement) to treat postoperative ileus (intestinal blockage), and, less commonly now, in the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia (though its use in this area has largely been replaced by other medications).


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions of your healthcare provider.

* **Anticholinergic Toxicity:**  Intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration is typical. Initial doses range from 0.5-2 mg.  The dose may be repeated every 10-30 minutes if symptoms persist.  Subsequent doses (1-4 mg) may be given at 30-60 minute intervals as needed.

* **Reversal of Non-Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blockade:** IM or IV administration of 0.5-1 mg.  Repeat every 10-30 minutes as needed until the desired response is achieved.

* **Alzheimer's Dementia (Historically Used):** Oral administration was common, with a starting dose of 0.5mg every 2 hours, up to 6-7 doses daily (maximum of 16mg/day).  This approach is generally outdated.

* **Postoperative Intestinal Atony:** IM or IV administration; usual dose is 0.5-2 mg.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Physostigmine is reserved for life-threatening situations in children, such as severe anticholinergic toxicity.  Dosage is calculated based on weight (0.02 mg/kg), with careful monitoring and a maximum single dose of 0.5 mg and a maximum total dose of 2 mg.  Use in children should only occur under strict medical supervision.  Dosage for preanesthetic reversal in children is also based on the weight and twice the dose of the administered anticholinergic drug.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Specific adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment aren't clearly defined in current guidelines.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these cases.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Increased salivation
* Stomach pain
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Palpitations
* Sweating (diaphoresis)
* Muscle twitching
* Miosis (pupil constriction)
* Lacrimation (increased tearing)
* Restlessness
* Nervousness
* Hallucinations
* Seizures (severe)
* Bronchospasm
* Respiratory distress
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) â€“ serious

Less common but serious side effects include seizures, respiratory paralysis, and cardiovascular collapse.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor.  Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter involved in muscle movement, nerve impulses, and many other bodily functions. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, physostigmine increases the amount of acetylcholine available. This heightened acetylcholine activity counteracts the effects of anticholinergic substances that block acetylcholine receptors. In essence, it helps restore the balance of nerve impulses and muscle function.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Physostigmine is contraindicated in patients with known allergies to salicylates (aspirin-like drugs), severe cardiovascular disease (including heart blocks), asthma, diabetes, gangrene, gastrointestinal or genitourinary obstruction, or any vagotonic state (increased parasympathetic activity). It is also contraindicated in combination with depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (like succinylcholine).


* **Drug Interactions:**  Physostigmine can interact with numerous drugs, including beta-blockers, cholinergic agonists, corticosteroids, aminoglycosides,  halogenated anesthetics, atropine, and others. These interactions can either enhance or diminish the effects of physostigmine, increasing the risk of side effects or reducing its effectiveness.


* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Physostigmine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  The use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.


* **Other Precautions:**  Physostigmine should be administered slowly intravenously to avoid rapid onset of adverse effects.  Careful monitoring is needed, especially for patients with underlying heart conditions, lung disease, or seizure disorders. Patients taking epileptogenic drugs (those which can cause seizures) should be particularly closely monitored.  Use with caution in neonates due to the potential for benzyl alcohol toxicity.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store physostigmine?**  A: Store according to the instructions on your prescription label.  Generally, it needs to be kept at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take physostigmine with other medications?** A: Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as there are numerous potential drug interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the dose; contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.

* **Q: How long will it take before I feel the effects of physostigmine?** A: The onset and duration of effects depend on the route of administration (IV, IM, oral) and the individual's metabolism. Consult your doctor.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects associated with physostigmine?** A:  Long-term use is rare outside of historically used treatments for Alzheimer's disease which are now outdated. Any long-term use requires careful monitoring by a medical professional.
