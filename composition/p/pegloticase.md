# Pegloticase
### Generic Name
Pegloticase

### Usage
Pegloticase is a medication used to treat chronic gout in adults.  It's specifically indicated for individuals whose gout hasn't responded adequately to standard treatments like other medications aimed at lowering uric acid levels.  Pegloticase is not used to treat asymptomatic hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels without gout symptoms).  Its primary use is to reduce serum uric acid levels, thereby alleviating the pain and inflammation associated with chronic gout attacks.

### Dosage
Pegloticase is administered intravenously (IV). The typical dosage for adults with chronic gout is 8 mg given as an IV infusion every two weeks.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Pre-medication:** Before each Pegloticase infusion, pre-medication with antihistamines and corticosteroids is typically given to minimize the risk of infusion reactions, including potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
* **Concomitant Medications:** Pegloticase is often co-administered with weekly oral methotrexate (15 mg) and folic acid or folinic acid supplementation.  Methotrexate and folic acid supplementation should begin at least 4 weeks before Pegloticase treatment and continue throughout the therapy.  However, Pegloticase can be used alone if methotrexate is contraindicated or unsuitable for the patient.
* **Urate Monitoring:** Serum uric acid levels should be monitored before each infusion.  If levels rise consistently above 6 mg/dL, particularly if two consecutive readings exceed this level, Pegloticase treatment should be discontinued.
* **Gout Flare Prophylaxis:**  To prevent gout flares, prophylactic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine is recommended, starting at least one week before Pegloticase initiation and continuing for at least six months.
* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Pegloticase in children haven't been established.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments aren't specified based on renal or hepatic impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Gout flares (more frequent with methotrexate co-administration)
* Arthralgia (joint pain, more frequent with methotrexate co-administration)
* Nausea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Infusion reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Hemolysis and methemoglobinemia (especially in patients with G6PD deficiency)
* Chest pain
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Peripheral swelling
* Fatigue
* Asthenia (general weakness or lack of energy)
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Pegloticase is a recombinant uricase enzyme.  It works by catalyzing the oxidation of uric acid (the substance that causes gout) into allantoin, a more soluble and easily excreted metabolite.  By lowering the level of uric acid in the blood, Pegloticase helps to prevent gout attacks and reduces the formation of urate crystals in the joints.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Pegloticase is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) to Pegloticase or its components, and in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
* **Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions:**  Pegloticase carries a boxed warning regarding the risk of anaphylaxis and infusion reactions.  These can occur during or after administration, and even with the first infusion.  Close monitoring is crucial.
* **G6PD Deficiency:**  Patients with, or at risk of, G6PD deficiency should be screened before initiating Pegloticase due to the increased risk of hemolysis and methemoglobinemia.
* **Heart Failure:** Pegloticase should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing heart failure.
* **Drug Interactions:** Co-administration with methotrexate can increase Pegloticase concentrations.  Interactions with other PEGylated products are possible due to the PEG portion of the drug, although the precise impact is unknown.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** There is limited data on Pegloticase use during pregnancy and lactation.  It should only be used if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the unknown risks.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Pegloticase?** A: The time to see a reduction in uric acid levels and improvement in gout symptoms varies, but it can take several weeks or months.

* **Q: How is Pegloticase stored?** A:  Refer to the medication's packaging for specific storage instructions. Generally, it should be stored as directed by the manufacturer, often refrigerated.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while using Pegloticase?** A:  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your healthcare provider to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience an infusion reaction?** A: Stop the infusion immediately and seek medical attention.

* **Q: Can I stop Pegloticase treatment if I feel better?** A:  Do not discontinue Pegloticase without consulting your physician.  Stopping treatment prematurely could lead to a recurrence of gout symptoms.  Treatment duration is determined by your doctor.
