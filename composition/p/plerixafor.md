# Plerixafor
### Generic Name
Plerixafor

### Usage
Plerixafor is a medication primarily used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the bone marrow into the bloodstream.  This mobilization is crucial for stem cell transplantation procedures, particularly in patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).  Its primary use is in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance the collection of HSCs for transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM).  Currently, it's not approved for use in other cancers or conditions.


### Dosage

**Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization (in NHL and MM):**  Dosage is determined by actual body weight and administered subcutaneously (subQ).  It's typically started after a patient has received filgrastim (a type of G-CSF) for four days. Plerixafor, filgrastim, and apheresis (the process of collecting stem cells) are usually continued daily for up to four days, or until enough stem cells are collected.  Plerixafor is given approximately 11 hours before each apheresis procedure.

* **Patients weighing ≤ 83 kg:** 20 mg fixed dose OR 0.24 mg/kg once daily (OD).
* **Patients weighing > 83 kg:** 0.24 mg/kg OD, with a maximum daily dose of 40 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≤ 50 mL/min.  Specific adjustments depend on weight and are detailed in the prescribing information.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are currently recommended by the manufacturer.
* **Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Plerixafor in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, etc.)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)


**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less frequent):**

* Insomnia
* Malaise
* Vomiting
* Various gastrointestinal issues (constipation, abdominal pain, etc.)
* Skin reactions (erythema, rash, etc.)
* Hyperleukocytosis (high white blood cell count)
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Anaphylaxis (rare but severe allergic reaction)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Plerixafor works by blocking the interaction between a protein called CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α).  SDF-1α normally keeps HSCs anchored within the bone marrow. By inhibiting this interaction, Plerixafor frees up the HSCs, allowing them to move into the bloodstream where they can be collected for transplantation.  It's most effective when used in conjunction with G-CSF, which stimulates the production of HSCs. This combined effect leads to a significantly greater number of HSCs being available for collection.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Plerixafor is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  There is an increased risk of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions. Close monitoring is crucial, especially during and after administration.
* **Hematologic Effects:** Plerixafor can affect blood cell counts, potentially causing leukocytosis (increased white blood cells) or thrombocytopenia (decreased platelets). Regular blood tests are essential to monitor these effects.
* **Splenic Effects:** There's a potential risk of splenic enlargement or rupture.  Patients should be monitored for symptoms.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Plerixafor is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning there is a risk to the developing fetus.  Pregnant women should not use this medication.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
* **Other Medications:**  While no significant interactions are currently known, inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see the effects of Plerixafor?**
A: The effects are seen within a short period, as the drug facilitates the mobilization of stem cells for collection, typically within a few days of treatment in combination with G-CSF.

**Q: How is Plerixafor stored?**
A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.

**Q: Is Plerixafor safe for everyone?**
A:  No, it's not safe for everyone. There are contraindications, precautions, and potential side effects. A healthcare provider must assess individual suitability.

**Q: Can I stop taking Plerixafor if I feel better?**
A:  Do not stop taking Plerixafor without consulting your healthcare provider.  The treatment course is determined based on the needs of the stem cell transplantation procedure.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  Contact your healthcare provider for instructions.  The missed dose and subsequent doses should be administered according to medical advice.
