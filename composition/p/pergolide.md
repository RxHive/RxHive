# Pergolide
### Generic Name
Pergolide

### Usage
Pergolide is an ergot derivative and dopamine agonist primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.  It's typically used as a second-line therapy, meaning it's considered after other treatments haven't been fully effective, or as an add-on medication to levodopa (another common Parkinson's medication) when a dopamine agonist is deemed necessary and non-ergot alkaloids are unsuitable or contraindicated.  It's crucial to understand that due to the risk of serious side effects like fibrotic reactions (scarring of tissues) and valvulopathy (heart valve problems), pergolide should only be initiated and monitored by a specialist.

### Dosage
Dosage for pergolide is highly individualized and must be carefully titrated (gradually increased) under close medical supervision.  There's no standard dosage that applies to everyone.  The following details represent general guidelines, not a prescription:

**Parkinson's Disease:**

* **Monotherapy (Pergolide as the sole medication):**  Oral administration is standard.  The starting dose is usually very low (50 mcg daily), gradually increased over several weeks to reach an effective dose. The maximum recommended daily dose is 3 mg, typically divided into three doses throughout the day.
* **Adjunctive Therapy (with levodopa):** Oral administration. The starting dose and titration schedule are similar to monotherapy, but the dose of levodopa might be reduced concurrently as pergolide's effect becomes apparent.  The maximum daily dose remains 3 mg.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of pergolide in children haven't been established, so it's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments for Impaired Liver or Kidney Function:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver or kidney impairment.  This highlights the importance of careful monitoring and dose adjustments under a doctor's guidance in such cases.

### Side Effects
Pergolide can cause various side effects, ranging in severity.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, confusion.
* **Serious (but less common):**  Acquired valvular heart disease (heart valve problems), retroperitoneal fibrosis (scarring behind the abdominal cavity), pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), hallucinations, impulse control disorders, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a severe neurological reaction), orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing), and sudden onset of sleep.


### How it Works
Pergolide is a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing brain cells are damaged, leading to movement difficulties. Pergolide binds to dopamine receptors in the brain, stimulating them and improving the transmission of signals involved in voluntary movement. This helps alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Pergolide is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a known hypersensitivity to pergolide or other ergot derivatives, a history of fibrotic disorders (e.g., pulmonary, retroperitoneal, or pericardial fibrosis), or existing cardiac valvulopathy.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Pergolide can interact with other medications, particularly dopamine antagonists (like some antipsychotics), impacting its effectiveness or causing adverse reactions.  It may also interact with warfarin (a blood thinner) and antihypertensive drugs (blood pressure medications), requiring careful monitoring.
* **Warnings:**  Pergolide carries a significant risk of cardiac valvulopathy, fibrotic reactions, and other serious side effects. Regular monitoring (including echocardiograms and other tests) is necessary.  It should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, a history of hallucinations or confusion, or those at risk of orthostatic hypotension.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Pergolide is categorized as Pregnancy Category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Use during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for Pergolide to work?** A: The onset of therapeutic effects varies significantly between individuals, and it may take several weeks of gradual dose adjustment to see improvement.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Pergolide abruptly?** A: No.  Abrupt discontinuation can lead to adverse effects.  Always consult your doctor before changing or stopping the medication.  Dosage reduction must be gradual.

* **Q: How should I store Pergolide?** A: Store Pergolide as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Is Pergolide addictive?** A: While not physically addictive in the same way as opioids, pergolide can lead to dependence, meaning the body adapts to its presence, and stopping it abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and discontinuation.
