# Paracetamol

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol (also known as Acetaminophen)

**Usage:** Paracetamol is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and fever.  It's commonly used for headaches, muscle aches, backaches, toothaches, colds, and flu.  It's available in various forms like tablets, capsules, liquids, and suppositories.

**Side Effects:**  Paracetamol is generally safe when taken as directed. However, side effects can occur, although they are relatively uncommon at recommended doses. These can include:

* **Rare but serious:** Liver damage (especially with overdose), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), low blood count.
* **Less serious:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite.

**How it Works:** Paracetamol reduces fever by acting on the area of the brain that regulates body temperature. Its mechanism for pain relief is less understood, but it's believed to affect the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that trigger pain and inflammation.  However, unlike ibuprofen or aspirin, paracetamol doesn't have significant anti-inflammatory effects.
