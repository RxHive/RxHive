# Plicamycin
### Generic Name
Plicamycin

### Usage
Plicamycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic, meaning it's used to fight cancer.  Its primary use was historically in the treatment of malignant testicular tumors in hospitalized patients where other treatments like surgery or radiation were unsuccessful.  It was also used to treat hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) and hypercalciuria (high calcium in urine) associated with advanced cancers, providing symptomatic relief.  It's crucial to understand that the manufacturer discontinued Plicamycin in 2000, and its use in other types of cancer is not recommended.


### Dosage
Dosage of Plicamycin is highly individualized and depends on the specific condition being treated and the patient's weight.  It's always administered intravenously (IV) via slow infusion, *never* as a rapid injection.

**Testicular Cancer (Historically):** The typical dose was 25-30 mcg/kg (0.025-0.030 mg/kg) daily for 8-10 days. The maximum daily dose was 30 mcg/kg.  Additional courses might be given monthly if needed, depending on the tumor response.

**Hypercalcemia Associated with Advanced Malignancy (Historically):**  The usual dose was 25 mcg (0.025 mg)/kg/day, infused slowly over 4-6 hours for 3 or 4 days.  Further courses could be given after a week or more if hypercalcemia persisted.

**Paget's Disease of Bone (Historically, Second or Third-Line):** A specific regimen involved 25 mcg/kg/day by slow infusion for 15 doses, followed by a reduced dose schedule.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Plicamycin should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant liver or kidney impairment.  The dosage may need adjustment based on the severity of hepatic or renal dysfunction.  Precise adjustments would be determined by a physician considering individual factors.

### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Loss of appetite
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Mouth sores
* Fever
* Drowsiness
* Weakness
* Lethargy
* Uneasiness
* Headache
* Depression
* Vein inflammation (phlebitis)
* Facial flushing
* Skin rash
* Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Abnormal liver function tests
* Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels

Serious, though less common, side effects can include severe thrombocytopenia (dangerously low platelet count) and bleeding, which can be life-threatening.  Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Plicamycin's exact mechanism for inhibiting tumor growth isn't fully understood but it's known to bind to DNA, interfering with RNA synthesis. This disrupts cellular processes essential for cancer cell growth and division.  Its effect on lowering blood calcium levels in hypercalcemia is also not fully elucidated but likely involves inhibiting the action of parathyroid hormone on bone cells (osteoclasts), thereby reducing calcium release from the bones.

### Precautions
Plicamycin is contraindicated in patients with:

* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Coagulation disorders (bleeding problems)
* Impaired bone marrow function
* Pregnancy (Category X â€“ known to cause fetal harm)

Plicamycin should be used cautiously in patients with significant liver or kidney impairment.  It chelates (binds to) divalent cations like iron, so avoid concomitant use with iron-containing products.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment due to potential harm to the infant.  Regular monitoring of blood counts, kidney and liver function is essential.

### FAQs

A: No, the manufacturer discontinued Plicamycin in 2000.

**Q:  What are the primary uses of Plicamycin?**
A: Historically, it was mainly used for certain testicular cancers and to manage hypercalcemia related to cancer.

**Q: How is Plicamycin administered?**
A: It's always given intravenously via slow infusion.

**Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Report all side effects, especially severe ones, to your healthcare provider immediately.

**Q: Are there alternatives to Plicamycin?**
A: Yes, many newer and more effective cancer treatments and hypercalcemia management strategies exist.  Your doctor can discuss suitable alternatives.

**Q: How is Plicamycin stored?**
A:  This information would have been found on the original product labeling but since the drug is no longer manufactured, this information is unavailable.
