# Pitolisant
### Generic Name
Pitolisant

### Usage
Pitolisant is primarily used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with narcolepsy.  Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime sleepiness and sudden sleep attacks.  Pitolisant's mechanism of action suggests potential in other conditions involving disrupted sleep-wake cycles, but currently, its approved use is limited to EDS in narcolepsy.

### Dosage

**Adults (Narcolepsy):** Pitolisant is administered orally once daily in the morning upon waking. The dosage is typically titrated upwards.

* **Week 1:** Start with 8.9 mg (two 4.45 mg tablets).
* **Week 2:** Increase to 17.8 mg (one 17.8 mg tablet).
* **Week 3:**  May be increased to a maximum of 35.6 mg (two 17.8 mg tablets) if tolerated.

Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with hepatic or renal impairment, or those taking certain medications (see Precautions section).  If a dose is missed, the next dose should be taken the following morning; do not double the dose.  It may take up to 8 weeks to see a full clinical response.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of pitolisant in children have not been established.

### How it Works

Pitolisant is a histamine H3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist.  Histamine H3 receptors are located in the brain and play a role in regulating wakefulness and sleep. By blocking or reversing the action of histamine at these receptors, pitolisant is thought to promote wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness.  The exact mechanism by which it improves narcolepsy symptoms is not fully understood.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pitolisant is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and those with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment. Pitolisant is not recommended for those with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Pitolisant's metabolism can be affected by other medications, particularly those that inhibit or induce certain liver enzymes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Concomitant use with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers (or those metabolized via this pathway) necessitates dose adjustments.  It may also interact with certain antidepressants (mirtazapine and tricyclics) and antihistamines, potentially diminishing its effects.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting pitolisant.
* **Cardiovascular Effects:**  Pitolisant may prolong the QT interval on an ECG, increasing the risk of serious heart rhythm problems.  It should be used cautiously in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, bradycardia, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia.
* **Hormonal Contraceptives:** Pitolisant may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Women of childbearing age should use a non-hormonal method of birth control during treatment and for at least 21 days after stopping the medication.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of pitolisant during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult a healthcare professional to weigh the risks and benefits.
