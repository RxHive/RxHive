# Pancreatin + Bile constituents + Simethicone

**Generic Name:** Pancreatin + Bile Salts + Simethicone

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and other conditions involving impaired fat digestion.  It's primarily used to help the body digest fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.  Conditions it might be prescribed for include:

* **Chronic pancreatitis:**  A condition where the pancreas doesn't produce enough digestive enzymes.
* **Cystic fibrosis:** A genetic disorder affecting multiple organs, including the pancreas.
* **Pancreatic cancer:** (in some cases, to aid digestion after surgery or treatment)
* **Post-gastrectomy syndrome:** Digestive issues following stomach surgery.
* **Steatorrhea:**  The excretion of excessive fat in the feces, often a symptom of maldigestion.
* **Bloating and gas:**  The simethicone component helps alleviate these symptoms.

**Side Effects:** While generally well-tolerated, side effects can occur and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal upset:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, or constipation.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.  (Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.)
* **Hyperuricemia:** Increased uric acid levels in the blood (rare).
* **Elevated liver enzymes:** (rare)
* **Interactions with other medications:** Some medications may interact with the components of this medication.


**How it Works:**

* **Pancreatin:** This contains enzymes (amylase, lipase, and protease) normally produced by the pancreas. These enzymes help break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in food, making them easier to digest and absorb.
* **Bile Salts:**  These aid in the digestion and absorption of fats.  They emulsify fats, breaking them down into smaller droplets that are easier for lipase (from the pancreatin) to work on.
* **Simethicone:**  This is an anti-foaming agent that helps to reduce gas and bloating by breaking up gas bubbles in the digestive tract.  It doesn't actually digest anything, but rather helps alleviate discomfort associated with gas.
