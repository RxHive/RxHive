# Pantoprazole + Ondansetron

**Generic Name:** Pantoprazole + Ondansetron

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and other conditions involving excess stomach acid, especially when accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  The pantoprazole component reduces stomach acid production, while the ondansetron component controls nausea and vomiting.  The specific conditions treated and dosage will be determined by a physician.  This is not a medication for self-treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects may include:

* **From Pantoprazole:** Headache, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, dizziness, rash, nausea.  Less common but more serious side effects include  bone fractures (with long-term use),  vitamin B12 deficiency, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.
* **From Ondansetron:** Headache, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue.  Less common but more serious side effects include  prolonged QT interval (affecting heart rhythm),  serotonin syndrome (rare but potentially life-threatening),  liver damage.


**How it Works:**

* **Pantoprazole:** This is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It works by reducing the amount of acid your stomach produces.  It does this by blocking the action of the "proton pump," an enzyme responsible for secreting acid into the stomach.
* **Ondansetron:** This is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of serotonin in the brain and gut, which helps to reduce nausea and vomiting.
