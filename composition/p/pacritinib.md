# Pacritinib
### Generic Name
Pacritinib

### Usage
Pacritinib is a medication used to treat adults with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary myelofibrosis.  Secondary myelofibrosis refers to the condition developing after polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.  A key criterion for using Pacritinib is a platelet count below 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.  This means the medication is specifically targeted to patients with a certain level of severity of the disease.  Pacritinib works by inhibiting certain kinases involved in the disease process, helping to manage symptoms and potentially improve the overall condition.  It's important to note that Pacritinib is not a cure for myelofibrosis.

### Dosage

**Adults (Myelofibrosis):** The usual adult dose is 200 mg taken twice daily (BID) orally.  This is given as two separate doses.  

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Pacritinib in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Several factors influence Pacritinib dosage.  

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). However, Pacritinib should be avoided in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 30 mL/min or higher.  Pacritinib should be avoided if the eGFR is less than 30 mL/min.

* **Adverse Reactions:** Dose reduction or discontinuation might be necessary based on the severity of side effects.  For example, dose reduction is indicated for diarrhea, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and bleeding.  Specific guidelines for dose adjustments based on the grade of these adverse reactions are provided in the prescribing information.

* **Surgical Procedures:** Pacritinib should be stopped 7 days before elective surgery or invasive procedures due to the increased risk of bleeding. It can be restarted only after hemostasis (the stopping of bleeding) is confirmed.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Fever (pyrexia)
* Nosebleeds (epistaxis)

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Severe bleeding
* Severe diarrhea
* Severe thrombocytopenia
* Prolonged QT interval (heart rhythm abnormality)

Any new or worsening side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Pacritinib is a kinase inhibitor.  Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in cell signaling.  In myelofibrosis, there is often dysregulation of certain kinases, particularly Janus kinase 2 (JAK2).  Pacritinib inhibits the activity of JAK2, along with other kinases such as FLT3, helping to regulate the abnormal cell growth and signaling processes contributing to the disease. By modulating these pathways, Pacritinib helps to alleviate symptoms and may improve disease progression.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pacritinib is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients concurrently taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  These are medications that either block or boost the activity of a liver enzyme that processes Pacritinib.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Pacritinib can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), or organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1).  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your healthcare provider before starting Pacritinib.

* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of bleeding, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, thrombosis (blood clot formation), prolonged QT interval, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), secondary malignancies (cancers), and serious infections with Pacritinib. Close monitoring is necessary.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Pacritinib during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established. It is recommended to avoid Pacritinib during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Pacritinib may also impair male fertility.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Pacritinib with food?** A: Yes, Pacritinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the next scheduled dose; do not double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store Pacritinib?** A: Store Pacritinib capsules at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Follow the instructions on the prescription label.

* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Severe bleeding, severe diarrhea, significant drop in platelet count, or new or worsening heart rhythm problems require immediate medical attention. Contact your healthcare provider right away if you experience any concerning symptoms.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while on Pacritinib?** A: Discuss alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider. Alcohol may interact with or worsen side effects.
