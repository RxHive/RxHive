# Posaconazole
### Generic Name
Posaconazole

### Usage
Posaconazole is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis (a yeast infection of the mouth and throat).  It's also used to prevent invasive fungal infections caused by *Aspergillus* and *Candida* species, particularly in people with weakened immune systems, such as those undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation.  In certain situations, it may also be used as a salvage therapy for mucormycosis (a rare but serious fungal infection) associated with COVID-19, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate amphotericin B.


### Dosage

**Note:**  Electrolyte abnormalities (like low potassium, magnesium, or calcium) should be corrected before starting and during treatment with posaconazole. Dosage adjustments may be needed based on liver or kidney function; consult a doctor for specific guidance.  Posaconazole comes in intravenous (IV) infusion, delayed-release tablets, and an oral suspension.  Dosage varies significantly based on the condition being treated and the formulation used.  The following information is for guidance only and should not replace professional medical advice.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.

**Adults:**

* **Invasive aspergillosis prophylaxis:**
    * IV: 300 mg twice daily on day 1, then 300 mg once daily thereafter.
    * Oral tablet: 300 mg twice daily on day 1, then 300 mg once daily thereafter.
    * Oral suspension: 200 mg (5 mL) three times daily.  Duration depends on the recovery from neutropenia (low white blood cell count) or immunosuppression.

* **Candida infection prophylaxis:** Dosage is the same as for invasive aspergillosis prophylaxis.

* **Oropharyngeal candidiasis treatment:**
    * Oral suspension: 100 mg (2.5 mL) twice daily on day 1, then 100 mg once daily for 13 days.
    * For infections resistant to itraconazole or fluconazole: 400 mg (10 mL) twice daily. Duration depends on the severity of the underlying condition and the clinical response.

* **Mucormycosis (COVID-19 related):**
    * Oral tablet or IV: 300 mg twice daily on day 1, then 300 mg once daily. This is typically used as step-down therapy after amphotericin B or as salvage therapy for those intolerant to amphotericin B.  Surgical debridement (removal of infected tissue) is also necessary for mucormycosis treatment.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of oral formulations in children under 13 and IV formulations in children under 18 are not established. Dosages for children 13 years and older generally follow the adult regimen, but this should only be determined and overseen by a pediatrician or physician familiar with pediatric dosing.

**Administration:** The oral suspension should be shaken well before use and taken with a full meal or, if that isn't possible, with a liquid nutritional supplement or an acidic carbonated beverage. Delayed-release tablets should be swallowed whole with food.  IV infusions should be administered over 90 minutes via a central venous line using an in-line filter.

### Side Effects

**Common (occurring in >10% of patients):** Fever, diarrhea, nausea, low potassium levels (hypokalemia), headache, abdominal pain, anemia, cough, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), constipation, shortness of breath (dyspnea),  febrile neutropenia (fever and low neutrophil count), chills (rigors), rashes, bloodstream infections (bacteremia), high blood pressure (hypertension), low magnesium levels (hypomagnesemia), fatigue, insomnia, mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes), musculoskeletal pain, loss of appetite (anorexia), herpes simplex, leg swelling (edema), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, nosebleeds (epistaxis), low blood pressure (hypotension), sore throat (pharyngitis), joint pain (arthralgia), dizziness, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), petechiae (small red spots on the skin), itching (pruritus), back pain, indigestion (dyspepsia), and vaginal bleeding.

**Less Common but Serious:**  Posaconazole can rarely cause more serious side effects, including liver damage (hepatotoxicity), heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation, torsades de pointes), and others.  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Posaconazole is an allylamine antifungal drug. It works by interfering with the production of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol synthesis, posaconazole weakens the fungal cell walls, leading to the death of the fungus.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Posaconazole should not be used by people with a known allergy to posaconazole or other azole antifungal agents.  It's also contraindicated with concurrent use of certain medications (see interactions below).
* **Drug Interactions:** Posaconazole interacts with many other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting posaconazole.  Significant interactions exist with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, including many common medications.
* **Warnings:** Posaconazole can prolong the QT interval in the heart, increasing the risk of dangerous heart rhythms.  It can also cause liver damage and should be used cautiously in individuals with liver problems.  Patients with kidney problems may also require dose adjustments. The use of posaconazole during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally discouraged due to insufficient data on safety.
* **Specific Populations:** Older adults and people with impaired liver or kidney function may need dose adjustments or close monitoring. Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed carefully with a doctor before starting treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking posaconazole?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while on posaconazole, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store posaconazole?** A: Store posaconazole according to the instructions on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions while taking posaconazole?** A: The oral suspension should be taken with food to improve absorption.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
