# Pioglitazone
### Generic Name
Pioglitazone

### Usage
Pioglitazone is primarily used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  This means it's used *in addition* to lifestyle changes, not as a replacement.  It's particularly helpful for individuals who haven't achieved adequate blood sugar control with diet and exercise alone or with metformin (another common diabetes medication). Pioglitazone works by decreasing insulin resistance in the body, making the insulin your body produces more effective at lowering blood sugar.  It is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Dosage

**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes):**  The usual starting dose is 15mg once daily.  This may be increased to 30mg or even 45mg daily depending on your response (as measured by HbA1c levels), but this should be done under the close supervision of a physician.  Importantly, if you have congestive heart failure (NYHA Class I or II), the maximum recommended dose is 15mg daily. Patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure should not use Pioglitazone.  

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Pioglitazone in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dose may need adjustment in individuals with liver problems.  If liver enzyme levels become elevated, treatment may need to be interrupted or stopped entirely. No dose adjustment is usually needed in those with kidney problems.  If Pioglitazone is used with certain other medications (such as strong CYP2C8 inhibitors like gemfibrozil), dose adjustments may be necessary to avoid excessively high levels of Pioglitazone in the blood.  Similarly, if used with insulin or other insulin-secretagogues, the dose of these medications may need to be lowered to avoid hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

**Form:** Pioglitazone is usually available as a tablet for oral administration.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Edema (swelling)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) – especially when used with insulin or sulfonylureas.
* Headache
* Weight gain

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Congestive heart failure (worsening of existing condition or new onset)
* Liver problems (including hepatitis and, rarely, liver failure)
* Bone fractures
* Bladder cancer (increased risk)
* Macular edema (swelling in the eye)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) that works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ).  PPAR-γ receptors are found in tissues like fat, muscle, and liver, all involved in how your body uses insulin and sugar.  By activating these receptors, Pioglitazone increases your body's sensitivity to insulin, improving how your body uses glucose and reducing blood sugar levels.  It's important to note that Pioglitazone itself doesn't stimulate insulin release; it works by making the insulin you already produce more effective.


### Precautions

* **Heart Failure:** Pioglitazone can worsen existing heart failure or cause new onset heart failure. It's contraindicated in individuals with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure.  Those with milder heart failure should be monitored closely.
* **Liver Disease:**  Pioglitazone can cause liver damage.  Liver function tests should be monitored regularly, especially at the start of treatment and after any dose increase.  Individuals with severe liver impairment should not use this medication.
* **Bladder Cancer:**  Studies have shown an increased risk of bladder cancer with Pioglitazone use. Individuals with a history of bladder cancer or unexplained blood in the urine should not take this medication.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Pioglitazone is a Category C drug during pregnancy. Other diabetes medications are preferred during pregnancy.  It is unknown whether Pioglitazone is excreted in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pioglitazone can interact with many other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Elderly:** Use in older adults should be approached with caution, considering the higher risk of bladder cancer and heart failure in this population.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Pioglitazone with other diabetes medications?** A: Yes, but it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor.  The doses of other diabetes medications (like insulin or sulfonylureas) might need adjustment to avoid low blood sugar.
* **Q: How should I store Pioglitazone?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effects of Pioglitazone may not be noticeable immediately.  It may take several weeks to see significant improvements in blood sugar control.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Pioglitazone suddenly?** A: No, stopping abruptly may be harmful.  Talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.
