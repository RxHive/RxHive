# Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Nicotinamide + Cyanocobalamin + Folic Acid + Chromium Picolinate + Selenious acid + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate
### Generic Name
Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Nicotinamide + Cyanocobalamin + Folic Acid + Chromium Picolinate + Selenious acid + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate


This combination is not a single generic medicine with one name but rather a multivitamin and mineral supplement.  It doesn't have a single, universally recognized generic name.  Each component has its own generic name (and often several brand names).  This combination is often marketed under various brand names depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.  For clarity, we will discuss each component individually below.

### Usage

This combination of vitamins and minerals addresses nutritional deficiencies.  Each component plays a vital role:

* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):** Crucial for brain development, red blood cell formation, and the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Deficiencies can lead to anemia, seizures, and neurological problems.

* **Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3):** Essential for energy production, DNA repair, and cell signaling.  Deficiencies can cause pellagra, a disease characterized by skin rashes, diarrhea, and dementia.

* **Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Essential for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. Deficiencies, common in vegans and older adults, can cause pernicious anemia and neurological damage.

* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):**  Vital for cell growth and development, especially important during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects. Deficiencies can lead to anemia and other health issues.

* **Chromium Picolinate:** Often used to improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate blood sugar levels.  Its role in overall health is still under investigation.

* **Selenious Acid (Selenium):** An antioxidant that protects cells from damage and is important for thyroid function and immune system health. Deficiencies can lead to various health problems.

* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate (Zinc):**  Plays a crucial role in immune function, wound healing, cell growth, and DNA synthesis. Deficiencies can weaken the immune system, impair wound healing, and lead to various other health problems.


The combined supplement aims to prevent or correct deficiencies in these vital nutrients.  It's often used as a preventative measure for individuals at risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as pregnant women, vegans, or older adults.  Specific indications depend on the individual's needs and should be determined by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific product and the individual's needs.  There is no single standardized dosage for this combination.  Each component has its own recommended daily allowance (RDA), and the amounts included in the supplement will vary.  Always follow the instructions on the product label.  A healthcare professional can determine the appropriate dosage based on individual factors like age, health status, and dietary habits.  This supplement is typically taken orally.  Intravenous administration of this specific combination is not standard practice.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent,  and often related to individual components:

* **Pyridoxine:**  Nausea, vomiting.  Very high doses can cause nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy).
* **Nicotinamide:** Flushing, itching, nausea, vomiting.  High doses can cause liver damage.
* **Cyanocobalamin:**  Allergic reactions are rare but possible.
* **Folic Acid:** Generally well-tolerated.  High doses may mask the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.
* **Chromium Picolinate:**  Gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, nausea).
* **Selenium:**  Hair loss, garlic breath, nausea, vomiting.  High doses can be toxic.
* **Zinc:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps.  High doses can interfere with copper absorption.

Serious side effects are uncommon but can occur with excessive consumption.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the supplement and consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

This supplement works by providing the body with essential vitamins and minerals that are either deficient in the diet or are not adequately absorbed. Each component performs its specific function in the body's metabolic processes, contributing to overall health and well-being.  For instance, Vitamin B12 is crucial for red blood cell production, while zinc supports immune function. The combined effect is to support numerous bodily functions at a cellular level.
