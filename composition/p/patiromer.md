# Patiromer
### Generic Name
Patiromer

### Usage
Patiromer is a medication used to treat hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by high levels of potassium in the blood.  It's specifically designed to lower potassium levels in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on dialysis or those with hyperkalemia not adequately controlled by other treatments.  It's important to note that patiromer is *not* a rapid-acting treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia due to its delayed onset of action; other treatments are necessary in such emergency situations.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The usual starting dose of patiromer is 8.4 grams once daily.  This dose may be adjusted at intervals of at least one week, increasing in increments of 8.4 grams, depending on the patient's serum potassium levels and the target range. The maximum daily dose is 25.2 grams.  Patiromer is administered orally.  The powder should be mixed with apple juice, cranberry juice, or water immediately before taking, and the mixture should be consumed promptly.  Do not administer patiromer in its dry form or add it to hot liquids.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of patiromer in children have not been established.  Therefore, its use in pediatric populations is not recommended.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to current prescribing information.  However, close monitoring of potassium levels is crucial in these patient groups.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) include:

*   Constipation
*   Diarrhea
*   Abdominal distress
*   Flatulence (gas)
*   Nausea
*   Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels)
*   Hypokalemia (low potassium levels â€“ paradoxical, but possible with excessive doses)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports) include:

*   Hypersensitivity reactions (such as lip edema)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Patiromer is a potassium-binding medication. It works in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by binding to potassium in the gut, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream.  This bound potassium is then eliminated from the body through the stool, thus lowering the serum potassium level. Patiromer is a cation-exchange polymer with a calcium-sorbitol counterion.  It actively binds potassium in the GI lumen, increasing fecal potassium excretion and reducing the amount of free potassium available for absorption.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Patiromer is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to patiromer or any of its components.
*   **Interactions:** Patiromer can interact with certain medications, potentially reducing their absorption.  This includes medications like ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine, and metformin.  If you are taking any of these medications, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist about the timing of administration of patiromer and these other medications (generally, separate the administration of these medications by at least three hours).
*   **Warnings:**  Use caution in elderly patients.  Patiromer may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and hypomagnesemia.  It should not be used in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction, or impaction, as it may worsen these conditions.  Patiromer is not a first-line treatment for acute or life-threatening hyperkalemia.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While patiromer is not systemically absorbed, its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally considered safe, though it is important to consult with your healthcare provider.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I take Patiromer?**  A:  Mix the powder with apple juice, cranberry juice, or water immediately before consumption. Do not take it in its dry form or add it to hot liquids. Drink the mixture immediately.
*   **Q: Can I take Patiromer with other medications?** A:  Consult with your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions, especially with ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine, and metformin. These medications should generally be taken at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after Patiromer.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose.
*   **Q: How should I store Patiromer?** A:  Store patiromer at room temperature and away from moisture.
*   **Q: Is Patiromer suitable for emergencies?** A: No, patiromer is not suitable for emergency treatment of life-threatening hyperkalemia because of its delayed onset of action. Other treatments are necessary for this condition.
