# Paromomycin
### Generic Name
Paromomycin

### Usage

Paromomycin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic primarily used to treat intestinal infections caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* (amebiasis).  This means it's effective against amoebas that cause amoebic dysentery and liver abscesses. It's also sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy in hepatic coma (liver failure), helping to reduce the ammonia levels in the blood.  Importantly,  the use of paromomycin in treating other conditions such as *Dientamoeba fragilis* infection, cryptosporidiosis (particularly in HIV-infected individuals), and certain tapeworm infections is considered off-label, meaning it's used outside of its officially approved indications.  Always consult a healthcare provider before using paromomycin for any condition other than amebiasis.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation (oral or topical).  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Intestinal amebiasis:** Typically 25-35 mg/kg/day divided into three doses, taken for 5-10 days.
* **Hepatic coma:** Usually 4 grams daily divided into multiple doses, for 5-6 days.
* **Off-label uses:** Dosages for conditions like cryptosporidiosis and tapeworm infections vary significantly and are determined on a case-by-case basis by the healthcare provider.

**Children:**

Dosage for children is usually calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) and is adjusted according to the specific condition and the child's age.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage.  Formulations are usually oral suspensions or syrups for ease of administration in children.  

**Important Note:** The information provided here is a general guideline.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the correct dosage for your specific situation.  They will consider various factors and provide the most appropriate treatment plan.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) are primarily gastrointestinal in nature and can include:

* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Heartburn
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Enterocolitis (inflammation of the intestines)
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Headache
* Ototoxicity (damage to the ears, potentially leading to hearing loss)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Steatorrhea (fatty stools)
* Vertigo (dizziness)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Paromomycin works by interfering with protein synthesis in bacteria and parasites.  Specifically, it binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, a critical component of bacterial and parasitic protein production. By disrupting this process, paromomycin inhibits the growth and replication of the target organisms, ultimately leading to their death.  In the case of amebiasis, this directly kills the *Entamoeba histolytica* amoebas. In hepatic coma, its action helps reduce the ammonia levels by affecting the intestinal flora that contributes to ammonia production.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Paromomycin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to paromomycin or any of its components, and those with intestinal obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:** There are no significant interactions specifically listed for paromomycin; however, as with all medications, inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Paromomycin should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment, pregnant or breastfeeding women (category C), and those with ulcerative bowel lesions.  The risk of superinfection (e.g., fungal or bacterial overgrowth) is increased, and close monitoring is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Paromomycin is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its safety has not been established. It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Paromomycin is generally considered not to be present in breast milk in significant amounts. However, consult with your healthcare provider regarding its use while breastfeeding.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take paromomycin with food?**
A: Yes, taking paromomycin with food can help to minimize gastrointestinal upset.

**Q: How should I store paromomycin?**
A: Store paromomycin as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I stop taking paromomycin if I feel better?**
A: No, it is crucial to complete the entire course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better before the medication is finished.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and potential complications.

**Q: Is paromomycin safe for long-term use?**
A:  Paromomycin is generally not intended for long-term use.  Its use is typically limited to specific infections for a defined period. Prolonged use can increase the risk of side effects.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of paromomycin?**
A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
