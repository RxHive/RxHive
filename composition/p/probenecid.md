# Probenecid

**Generic Name:** Probenecid

**Usage:**

Probenecid is used to treat gout.  It works by increasing the excretion of uric acid from the body.  High levels of uric acid in the blood can lead to gout attacks, characterized by painful swelling and inflammation in the joints. Probenecid is not typically used to treat acute gout attacks; it's preventative.  It's also used in combination with other medications to increase their blood levels and extend their effects. Specifically, it's used to prolong the effectiveness of certain penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of probenecid include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Stomach pain
* Kidney stones (less common, but serious)

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools)
* Anemia
* Blood disorders

**How it Works:**

Probenecid inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidneys. This means that more uric acid is excreted in the urine, lowering the level of uric acid in the blood.  In the case of antibiotics, it inhibits the secretion of certain drugs in the kidneys, effectively increasing their blood concentration and duration of action.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take probenecid to treat a gout attack?** A: No. Probenecid is a preventative medication, not a treatment for acute gout flares. You'll need other medications like NSAIDs or colchicine to treat a gout attack.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: It can take several weeks or even months to see a reduction in uric acid levels and a decrease in gout attacks.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects.  Mild side effects may subside as your body adjusts to the medication.
* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions while taking probenecid?** A:  It's important to drink plenty of fluids to help prevent kidney stones.  Your doctor may also recommend dietary changes to reduce uric acid levels, such as limiting purine-rich foods.
* **Q: Can I take probenecid with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as probenecid can interact with other drugs.  This is especially important with other medications that are excreted by the kidneys.
* **Q: Can I stop taking probenecid suddenly?** A: No. You should always talk to your doctor before stopping probenecid, as sudden cessation can lead to a flare-up of gout.
