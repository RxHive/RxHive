# Probenecid
### Generic Name
Probenecid

### Usage
Probenecid is primarily used to treat hyperuricemia, a condition characterized by high levels of uric acid in the blood. This high uric acid can lead to gout and gouty arthritis, causing painful inflammation in the joints.  Probenecid works by increasing the excretion of uric acid through the kidneys, thus lowering the uric acid levels in the blood.

Beyond its primary use in gout management, Probenecid has a secondary, important role in enhancing the effectiveness of certain antibiotics. Specifically, it elevates and prolongs the blood levels of beta-lactam antibiotics (like penicillin and some cephalosporins). This is because Probenecid inhibits the kidneys' ability to remove these antibiotics, allowing them to remain in the body for a longer duration and at higher concentrations, potentially improving treatment outcomes for infections.  Note that this use is usually guided by a physician's decision based on the specific infection and antibiotic being used.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hyperuricemia with Gout:**  Treatment typically begins with 250 mg twice daily (BID) for one week.  The dose may then be increased to 500 mg BID, and further increased in 500 mg increments every four weeks as needed, up to a maximum of 2 grams per day.  Once uric acid levels are normal and gout attacks have been absent for six months, the dose may be reduced gradually.

* **With Beta-lactam Antibiotics:**  A common dosage is 500 mg four times daily (QID). The exact dosage and duration will depend on the specific antibiotic and the infection being treated.  This is always prescribed and monitored by a physician, and is not a standalone medication.

* **Off-Label Uses:**  Probenecid may also be used in combination with other medications to treat conditions like pelvic inflammatory disease and neurosyphilis, but these are off-label uses and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Probenecid use in children is primarily in conjunction with beta-lactam antibiotics.  Dosage is weight-based and determined by a physician, varying according to the child's weight and the specific antibiotic prescribed.  Probenecid is generally not used to treat hyperuricemia in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in individuals with impaired kidney function (GFR <30 mL/min).  Probenecid should generally be avoided in those with significantly reduced kidney function because it may be less effective and potentially cause harm.  Hepatic impairment does not typically require dosage adjustments.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Indigestion
* Skin rash
* Stomach upset

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Kidney stones
* Anemia
* Liver damage

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Probenecid works by competitively inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidneys. This means it blocks the process by which the body normally reabsorbs uric acid, leading to increased uric acid excretion in the urine. This reduces the amount of uric acid circulating in the bloodstream.  Similarly, it inhibits the reabsorption of certain antibiotics like penicillin, leading to increased blood levels of these drugs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Probenecid is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to probenecid or its components, those with certain types of kidney stones,  severe kidney disease, blood disorders,  and during an acute gout attack.  It's not generally used in children under two years of age.

* **Interactions:** Probenecid can interact with many other medications, including aspirin, certain diuretics, and various other drugs.  It can increase or decrease the blood levels of these medications, affecting their effectiveness or potentially leading to adverse effects.  It is crucial to inform your physician of all medications you are taking before starting probenecid.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Probenecid is categorized as pregnancy category B, indicating limited data in humans.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should drink plenty of fluids while taking probenecid to help flush out uric acid and prevent kidney stone formation.  It's generally recommended to take probenecid with food or antacids to reduce gastrointestinal discomfort.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take probenecid if I have kidney problems?** A: No, probenecid is generally not recommended for individuals with significant kidney impairment, as it may be ineffective and potentially harmful.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results with probenecid for gout?** A: It may take several weeks or months to see a significant reduction in uric acid levels and a decrease in gout attacks.

* **Q: Should I avoid certain foods while taking probenecid?** A: A doctor might advise you to reduce your intake of purine-rich foods (organ meats, red meat, and certain seafood) as these can increase uric acid levels.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of probenecid?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store probenecid?** A: Store probenecid at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
