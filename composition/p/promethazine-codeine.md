# Promethazine + Codeine
### Generic Name
Promethazine + Codeine

### Usage

Promethazine and Codeine combination is a prescription medication used for the temporary relief of coughs and upper respiratory tract symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold.  It's a combination of promethazine, an antihistamine that helps reduce inflammation and mucus production, and codeine, an opioid cough suppressant that reduces the urge to cough.  This combination is generally used for short-term relief of bothersome symptoms and is not intended for long-term use.  It's crucial to remember that this medication should only be used as directed by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and the prescription label precisely.  Typical doses include:

* **For cough and upper respiratory symptoms:**  The medication comes in syrup form with varying concentrations of promethazine and codeine (e.g., 6.25 mg promethazine/10 mg codeine per 5 mL or 3.6 mg promethazine/9 mg codeine per 5 mL).  The prescribed dosage and frequency will be indicated on the label.  Typical ranges involve 5 mL every 4-6 hours, but the maximum daily dose should never be exceeded.  This maximum varies by formulation.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The use of Promethazine + Codeine is generally **contraindicated** in children under 12 years old.  For children aged 12 and older, a doctor might prescribe it but only at a much lower dose than adults, and only under strict medical supervision due to the significant risks associated with codeine in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney problems.  Always inform your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions before starting this medication.

### How it Works

Promethazine works by blocking histamine receptors in the body, reducing inflammation and the production of mucus in the respiratory tract.  Codeine acts on opioid receptors in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.  Together, they work to alleviate the symptoms of coughs and upper respiratory illnesses.
