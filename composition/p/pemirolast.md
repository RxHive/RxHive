# Pemirolast
### Generic Name
Pemirolast

### Usage
Pemirolast is primarily used to prevent itching in the eyes caused by allergic conjunctivitis.  This is a common condition where the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye) becomes inflamed due to an allergic reaction.  It's important to note that pemirolast prevents itching; it doesn't treat the underlying allergy itself.

### Dosage

**Allergic Conjunctivitis:**

* **Adults and Children over 3 years:** The typical dosage is 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) four times a day (qid).  Treatment duration usually ranges from a few days to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to treatment.  
* **Children under 3 years:** The safety and effectiveness of pemirolast have not been established in children under 3 years of age.  This medication should not be used in this age group.

**Administration:**  Pemirolast is administered topically as eye drops.  Ensure hands are clean before application. Gently pull down the lower eyelid to create a pocket, and instill the drops into this pocket. Avoid touching the dropper tip to the eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) may include:

* Burning
* Dry eyes
* Foreign body sensation (feeling like something is in the eye)
* Ocular discomfort
* Allergy-related symptoms such as bronchitis, cough, sneezing, and nasal congestion.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects are rare with pemirolast, but if any significant or persistent adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Pemirolast is a mast cell stabilizer. Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other inflammatory substances when triggered by allergens.  These substances contribute to the itching and inflammation associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Pemirolast works by inhibiting the release of these inflammatory mediators from mast cells, thereby reducing the allergic response and preventing itching. It may also inhibit the movement (chemotaxis) of eosinophils, another type of immune cell involved in allergic reactions.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Pemirolast should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to pemirolast or any of its components.
* **Ocular Disorders:** Use caution if you have any pre-existing eye conditions.  Consult your doctor before using pemirolast.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pemirolast is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be approached with caution, and only after consultation with a healthcare professional who can weigh the benefits against the potential risks.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor about all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking.  Potential drug interactions are not extensively documented, but it's crucial to maintain open communication with your doctor.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for individuals with kidney or liver problems. However, consult your physician for personalized guidance if you have these conditions.
