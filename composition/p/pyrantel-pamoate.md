# Pyrantel Pamoate

**Generic Name:** Pyrantel Pamoate

**Usage:** Pyrantel pamoate is an anthelmintic medication used to treat infections caused by intestinal worms, specifically pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis) and roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides).  It's often used in both adults and children.  The specific dosage and frequency depend on the age and weight of the patient and the type of infection, so always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions.


**Side Effects:**  Pyrantel pamoate is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These are usually mild and temporary and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, loss of appetite
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Sleepiness**
* **Rash**


More serious side effects are rare but can include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These are characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives. Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Liver problems:** Although rare, liver problems have been reported. Contact a doctor if you experience jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), dark urine, or light-colored stools.


**How it Works:** Pyrantel pamoate paralyzes the worms in the intestines, preventing them from attaching to the intestinal wall. This paralysis makes it easier for the body to expel the worms through the stool.  It's important to note that it does not kill the worm eggs, so repeated treatment may be necessary to eliminate the infection completely.
