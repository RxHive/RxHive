# Pegaptanib
### Generic Name
Pegaptanib

### Usage
Pegaptanib is primarily used to treat neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  This is a serious eye condition where abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, leading to vision loss.  Pegaptanib's main role is to slow down or stop the growth of these new blood vessels, thus helping to preserve vision.  It's crucial to understand that Pegaptanib doesn't restore already lost vision; its purpose is to prevent further deterioration.


### Dosage
Pegaptanib is administered via intravitreal injection (directly into the eye).  The standard dose for adults with neovascular AMD is 0.3 mg injected into the affected eye once every six weeks.  The safety and efficacy of injecting both eyes simultaneously haven't been established.  There is no established dosage for children as the safety and efficacy in pediatric patients haven't been determined.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Ophthalmic:  Anterior chamber inflammation, blurred vision, cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, corneal edema, decreased visual acuity, eye discharge, eye discomfort, eye irritation, eye pain, increased intraocular pressure, punctate keratitis, visual disturbance, vitreous opacity.
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension.

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**

* A wide range of ophthalmic issues (blepharitis, conjunctivitis, etc.), cardiovascular events (stroke, chest pain, etc.), gastrointestinal problems, skin reactions, and other systemic effects.  A complete list is provided in the detailed information.


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Pegaptanib is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.  VEGF is a protein that plays a vital role in the formation of new blood vessels. In wet AMD, excessive VEGF stimulates the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina. Pegaptanib works by binding to VEGF in the eye, preventing it from stimulating this abnormal blood vessel growth.  By inhibiting VEGF, Pegaptanib helps to stabilize the existing blood vessels and reduce further damage to the retina, thus slowing vision loss.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Pegaptanib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and those with ocular or periocular infections.

**Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of endophthalmitis (eye infection), retinal detachment, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), increased intraocular pressure, and thromboembolic events.

**Use with Caution:**  Use caution in breastfeeding women, as excretion in breast milk is unknown.

**Drug Interactions:** Pegaptanib levels may be affected by other medications. Consult your doctor about potential interactions with other drugs you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A:  The improvement in vision varies among patients, and it's not a rapid process.  Regular monitoring is essential to assess the treatment's effectiveness.

* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q: Are there any long-term side effects?** A: While most side effects are temporary, some long-term effects are possible.  Regular check-ups with your ophthalmologist are crucial for monitoring any potential complications.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving the injection?** A: Blurred vision is a possible side effect.  Follow your doctor's advice regarding driving after the injection.  You should not drive if you experience impaired vision.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to reschedule the injection as soon as possible.
