# Pegaptanib

**Generic Name:** Pegaptanib sodium

**Usage:**

Pegaptanib is used to treat neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  Specifically, it's indicated for patients with predominantly classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with AMD.  It's an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agent, meaning it targets the growth of abnormal blood vessels that can cause vision loss in wet AMD.  It's administered by intravitreal injection (directly into the eye).

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of pegaptanib include:

* **Eye-related:**  Eye pain, eye redness, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, subconjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding under the conjunctiva), cataracts, and inflammation within the eye.
* **Systemic (throughout the body):**  Headache, and rarely, more serious reactions like allergic reactions.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Infection:** Increased risk of eye infection.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Allergic reactions.


It's crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences may vary.  Patients should report any new or worsening symptoms to their ophthalmologist immediately.

**How it Works:**

Pegaptanib is an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) aptamer.  VEGF is a protein that stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. In wet AMD, abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the retina, leading to leakage and damage. Pegaptanib selectively binds to VEGF-isoform 165, a major isoform responsible for the formation of these abnormal blood vessels, thereby inhibiting its activity and reducing the growth of new, leaky blood vessels. This helps to stabilize vision and prevent further vision loss.

**FAQs:**

* **How often is pegaptanib injected?** The frequency of injections varies depending on individual response and the doctor's assessment, but it's typically administered monthly or at longer intervals as determined by the treating ophthalmologist.

* **Is pegaptanib effective for all types of AMD?**  No, pegaptanib is primarily effective for wet AMD with predominantly classic CNV. It's not typically used for dry AMD or other types of macular degeneration.

* **Are there any interactions with other medications?**  While not extensively documented, it's essential to inform the ophthalmologist of all medications being taken, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to assess potential interactions.

* **What are the long-term effects of pegaptanib?** Long-term studies have shown that pegaptanib can help stabilize vision in many patients, but the need for continued treatment to maintain this stabilization is common.  The potential for long-term side effects requires ongoing monitoring by an ophthalmologist.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Report any new or worsening symptoms, especially those affecting your vision, to your ophthalmologist immediately.
