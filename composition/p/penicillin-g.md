# Penicillin G

**Generic Name:** Penicillin G (also known as Benzylpenicillin)

**Usage:** Penicillin G is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections, including but not limited to:

* **Pneumonia:**  Especially caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
* **Meningitis:**  Caused by susceptible bacteria like *Neisseria meningitidis* and *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.
* **Syphilis:**  All stages of syphilis are treatable with Penicillin G.
* **Lyme disease:**  Early stages of Lyme disease.
* **Endocarditis:**  Bacterial infection of the heart valves.
* **Septicemia:**  Bloodstream infections.
* **Gas gangrene:**  Serious bacterial infection of soft tissues.
* **Bacterial infections of skin and soft tissues:**  Cellulitis, abscesses, etc.


**Note:** Penicillin G is primarily administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) due to its poor oral absorption.  Different preparations exist for various administration routes.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Mild:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rash (common, but often mild).
* **Moderate:**  Yeast infections (due to disruption of normal gut flora), injection site pain or inflammation (with IM or IV administration).
* **Severe (rare but serious):**  Allergic reactions (ranging from hives and itching to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition), seizures (especially with high doses or impaired kidney function), jaundice (liver inflammation), and blood disorders.


**How it Works:** Penicillin G is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By disrupting the cell wall formation, penicillin G prevents bacterial cells from growing and reproducing, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  It is bactericidal (kills bacteria).
