# Patisiran
### Generic Name
Patisiran

### Usage
Patisiran is a medication used to treat the polyneuropathy (nerve damage) associated with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis).  This condition is a rare, inherited disorder where a misfolded protein (transthyretin or TTR) builds up in various organs, most notably nerves and the heart, causing damage. Patisiran's primary use is to alleviate the symptoms of the nerve damage characteristic of hATTR amyloidosis, improving quality of life for affected individuals.  While it primarily targets polyneuropathy, some studies suggest potential benefits in other hATTR amyloidosis-related symptoms, though this isn't yet a formally approved indication.

### Dosage
Patisiran is administered intravenously (IV) over approximately 80 minutes.  Dosage is determined by body weight:

* **Adults weighing less than 100 kg:** 0.3 mg/kg every three weeks.
* **Adults weighing 100 kg or more:** 30 mg every three weeks.

**Important Note:**  Patisiran requires premedication to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs). This usually includes a corticosteroid (e.g., dexamethasone), an H1 blocker (e.g., diphenhydramine), an H2 blocker (e.g., ranitidine), and acetaminophen.  The premedication should be given at least 60 minutes before the Patisiran infusion.  Dosage adjustments for premedication might be needed depending on individual tolerance. The information provided here is for guidance only; always follow your doctorâ€™s specific instructions.

Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment aren't explicitly defined in the current labeling for all levels of impairment.  Consult your healthcare professional for advice in these situations.  There is no established pediatric dosage.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10%) may include upper respiratory tract infections and infusion-related reactions (IRRs).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients can include:

* Vertigo
* Atrioventricular block (heart rhythm disturbance)
* Flushing
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Erythema (redness of the skin)
* Muscle spasms
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Dry eye syndrome
* Blurred vision
* Visual disturbances
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Bronchitis


Less common, but potentially serious side effects (<1%, from post-marketing surveillance or case reports), include hypotension (low blood pressure), injection site extravasation (leakage from the vein), syncope (fainting), and vitamin A deficiency.  

**It is crucial to report any side effects to your doctor immediately.**  Serious side effects may require immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Patisiran is a type of RNA interference (RNAi) therapy.  It works by silencing the production of the misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein in the liver. This is achieved through a double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecule that targets the TTR messenger RNA (mRNA), preventing the production of the faulty protein. By reducing the amount of misfolded TTR, Patisiran lessens the accumulation of amyloid deposits in tissues and organs, thereby slowing the progression of nerve damage and other symptoms associated with hATTR amyloidosis.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Patisiran is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the drug or any of its components.
* **Infusion-related reactions (IRRs):** IRRs are a known risk and premedication is crucial to mitigate them.  Slowing or stopping the infusion may be necessary if an IRR occurs.  Serious IRRs require discontinuation of the treatment.
* **Vitamin A deficiency:** Patisiran can lower serum vitamin A levels.  Monitoring of vitamin A levels and supplementation may be necessary.  This is particularly important for pregnant women, as vitamin A is crucial for fetal development.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of Patisiran during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks.  Consult your doctor for specific advice.
* **Other medications:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions might occur.
* **Liver and kidney function:** While specific dosage adjustments are not clearly defined for all levels of liver and kidney impairment in the manufacturer's labeling, monitoring of liver and kidney function is important.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Patisiran?** A: The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your individual response to the therapy.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose and remember within 3 days, take it as soon as possible and resume your regular schedule. If more than 3 days have passed, consult your doctor.
* **Q: How is Patisiran stored?** A: Patisiran should be stored under refrigeration.  Specific instructions will be provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.
* **Q:  Can Patisiran cure hATTR amyloidosis?** A:  No, Patisiran doesn't cure hATTR amyloidosis, but it can help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Patisiran?** A:  Long-term studies are ongoing, and potential long-term effects are still being evaluated. Regular monitoring by your doctor is essential.
