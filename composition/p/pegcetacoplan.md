# Pegcetacoplan
### Generic Name
Pegcetacoplan

### Usage
Pegcetacoplan is a medication used to treat adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare blood disorder where red blood cells are destroyed prematurely, leading to anemia, fatigue, and other symptoms. Pegcetacoplan works by targeting a specific part of the complement system, a part of the immune system that can contribute to the destruction of red blood cells in PNH.  This medication helps to reduce the breakdown of red blood cells, thus alleviating PNH symptoms.

### Dosage
Pegcetacoplan is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) using a commercially available infusion pump with a reservoir of at least 20 mL. The standard adult dose is 1080 mg twice weekly.  However, this dosage may need adjustment. If lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a marker of red blood cell breakdown, are greater than twice the upper limit of normal (ULN), the dose should be adjusted to 1080 mg every three days.  If a dose increase is necessary, LDH levels should be monitored twice weekly for at least four weeks.  

**Important Note:**  Patients should be vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria (such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, and *Haemophilus influenzae* type B) at least two weeks before starting Pegcetacoplan. If vaccination is not possible before starting the medication, two weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis should be given.  There is no established dosage for children.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include fatigue, respiratory tract infections, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and injection-site reactions.  Less common but potentially serious side effects include headache, chest pain, hypertension, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs), mesenteric ischemia (reduced blood flow to the intestines), sepsis (a life-threatening infection), back pain, and serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis). Meningococcal infections, though rare, can also occur.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Pegcetacoplan works by inhibiting the complement system, a crucial part of the immune system.  Specifically, it binds to complement protein C3 and its activated fragment C3b.  By binding to these proteins, Pegcetacoplan prevents the further activation of the complement cascade. This is particularly important in PNH, as uncontrolled complement activation leads to the destruction of red blood cells. By blocking this activation, Pegcetacoplan helps protect red blood cells from premature destruction.

### Precautions
Pegcetacoplan is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components, and in those who are not vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria (unless the risks of delaying treatment outweigh the infection risk). Patients with unresolved serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria should also not use this medication.  There's an increased risk of serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria and infusion-related reactions.  

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pegcetacoplan may harm the developing fetus.  Pregnancy testing is recommended for women of reproductive age before starting treatment. Effective contraception should be used during treatment and for 40 days after the last dose.  Because it's unknown whether Pegcetacoplan is excreted in breast milk, breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for 40 days after the final dose.
