# Plazomicin
### Generic Name
Plazomicin

### Usage
Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used primarily to treat complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis (kidney infection), in adults 18 years and older.  It's reserved for situations where other treatment options are limited or unavailable due to bacterial resistance.  This is because it is a newer aminoglycoside designed to overcome resistance mechanisms seen in some bacteria that make older aminoglycosides less effective.  It is *not* indicated for use in children, as safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations.

### Dosage
Dosage is determined by the patient's weight and kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  

**Adults (cUTI, including pyelonephritis):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** The typical dose is 15 mg/kg given once daily (OD) as an infusion over 30 minutes.  The duration of treatment is usually 4-7 days. IV therapy might be followed by an oral antibiotic to complete a total treatment course of 7-10 days.
* **Dosage Adjustment for Obesity:** For individuals whose total body weight (TBW) exceeds their ideal body weight (IBW) by 25% or more, the adjusted body weight (ABW) should be used for dosing calculations.  The formula is: ABW = IBW + 0.4 x (TBW - IBW).
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):
    * CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min: No adjustment needed.
    * CrCl 30-59 mL/min: 10 mg/kg every 24 hours.
    * CrCl 15-29 mL/min: 10 mg/kg every 48 hours.
    * CrCl < 15 mL/min:  Dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling.  
    * End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT): Dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling.


**Children:**  Plazomicin is not approved for use in children.

**Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer’s labeling for patients with liver impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
* Ototoxicity (hearing and balance problems)
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Acute kidney failure

**Less Common Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Gastritis (stomach inflammation)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Hematuria (blood in urine)
* Increased serum ALT level (liver enzyme)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Reversible hypoacusis (hearing loss)
* Irreversible tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Vertigo (dizziness)

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Plazomicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria. This action interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from growing and reproducing. The disruption ultimately leads to cell death and the resolution of the infection. The mechanism of action of plazomicin differs slightly from older aminoglycosides, contributing to its effectiveness against some bacteria resistant to other aminoglycosides.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Plazomicin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to plazomicin, other aminoglycosides, or any component of the formulation.
* **Nephrotoxicity:**  Plazomicin can cause kidney damage (nephrotoxicity), especially in patients with pre-existing kidney problems, the elderly, or those taking other nephrotoxic medications.  Kidney function should be closely monitored before, during, and after treatment.  Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be recommended in patients with CrCl <90 mL/min.
* **Ototoxicity:** Plazomicin can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or vertigo (ototoxicity), particularly in patients with pre-existing hearing loss, renal impairment, or those receiving higher doses or longer durations of treatment than recommended.
* **Neuromuscular Blockade:**  Plazomicin can cause neuromuscular blockade, potentially leading to muscle weakness or paralysis. This is of particular concern in patients with neuromuscular disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis) or those receiving neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Plazomicin may harm the developing fetus, and excretion in breast milk is unknown; it should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding after careful consideration of risks and benefits by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:** Plazomicin can interact with other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness or causing increased side effects.  Discuss all your medications with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Superinfection:**  Like many antibiotics, Plazomicin may increase the risk of *Clostridioides difficile* infection (C. diff), a serious bowel infection.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Plazomicin?**  A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the label.  Generally, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.
* **Q: Can I take Plazomicin with other medications?** A: It is crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, supplements, or herbal products you are taking, to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: Is Plazomicin safe for pregnant women?** A: No, it is not recommended during pregnancy.  The potential risks to the fetus outweigh the benefits in most cases.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Plazomicin?**  A: Consult with your doctor. Alcohol can interact with some medications and may worsen side effects.  
* **Q:  How long does it take for Plazomicin to work?** A:  The time it takes for symptoms to improve varies among individuals.  It's essential to complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if you feel better before the course is finished.
