# Peramivir
### Generic Name
Peramivir

### Usage
Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor primarily used to treat acute, uncomplicated influenza (the flu) in adults and children.  It's most effective when started within two days of symptom onset. While its primary use is for uncomplicated influenza, it may also be used off-label in hospitalized patients with influenza who cannot tolerate or absorb oral antiviral medications due to issues like gastric problems or malabsorption.  This off-label use requires careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults (Influenza):**  For acute, uncomplicated influenza, the standard adult dose is 600 mg administered intravenously (IV) as a single dose.  This should be given within two days of the first flu symptoms. For hospitalized patients, off-label use may involve 600 mg daily (once daily) for up to 5-10 days, but this is only considered if other oral options are unsuitable.  Dosage adjustments are needed for those with kidney problems (renal impairment).

**Pediatric Patients (Influenza):** For acute, uncomplicated influenza in children aged 6 months and older, the dose is 12 mg/kg given as a single IV dose within two days of symptom onset. The maximum single dose is 600 mg. Adolescents receive the same 600 mg single dose as adults.  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on kidney function.


**Dosage Adjustments for Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are crucial for patients with reduced kidney function (renal impairment).  The specific adjustment depends on the creatinine clearance (CrCl) rate and whether the patient is undergoing dialysis.  These adjustments are complex and should be determined by a healthcare professional familiar with peramivir and the individual's kidney function.  The provided information above only outlines the general principle and should not be used for self-dosing adjustments.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Insomnia
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Increased blood glucose levels
* Constipation, diarrhea, vomiting
* Proteinuria (protein in the urine)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Abnormal behavior
* Delirium
* Hallucinations
* Serious skin reactions (erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor.  Neuraminidase is an enzyme on the surface of the influenza virus.  Peramivir blocks this enzyme's activity, preventing the virus from releasing new viral particles from infected cells.  By inhibiting this crucial step in the viral life cycle, Peramivir helps reduce the severity and duration of the flu.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Peramivir is contraindicated in individuals with a known serious hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to peramivir or any of its components.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Use caution in patients with reduced kidney function. Dosage adjustments are essential based on creatinine clearance. Close monitoring is required.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Peramivir is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning the risks to the developing fetus are not fully known.  It's generally not the first-line treatment during pregnancy, but it may be used when other options are unsuitable.  The decision to breastfeed during treatment requires careful consideration of potential risks to the infant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Peramivir may reduce the effectiveness of live attenuated influenza vaccines.
* **Skin Reactions:** There is an increased risk of serious skin reactions and hypersensitivity reactions.  Monitor for rashes and any signs of allergic reactions.
* **Neuropsychiatric Events:** The potential for neuropsychiatric events (abnormal behavior, delirium, hallucinations) warrants careful monitoring, particularly in vulnerable populations.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Peramivir administered?** A: Peramivir is administered intravenously (IV) as a single dose or over a short course for hospitalized patients. It is diluted in a compatible solution before infusion.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of action varies, but it's crucial to start treatment within two days of symptom onset for optimal results.

* **Q: Can I take Peramivir with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Some interactions are possible, and your doctor can assess if Peramivir is safe to use with your other medications.
