# Piroxicam (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Piroxicam (Systemic)

### Usage
Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  It's also sometimes used off-label for ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).  The primary action is to reduce pain and inflammation associated with these conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:** The usual oral dose is 20mg once daily.  A lower dose of 10-20mg daily may be used in some cases, but this is off-label and should only be determined by a doctor.  A rectal dosage of 20mg once daily is also possible.
* **Ankylosing Spondylitis (off-label):** The usual oral dose is 10-20mg daily, divided or not, as determined by a doctor.


**Children and Adolescents (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis):**

* Oral: 0.2-0.4 mg/kg/day once daily. The maximum daily dose is 20mg.  Piroxicam is generally not recommended for children under 16 unless specifically prescribed by a specialist.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  While specific dosage adjustments aren't explicitly outlined in manufacturer labeling, dose reduction is generally recommended for individuals with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is specifically provided for mild to moderate renal impairment. However, piroxicam is generally not recommended for those with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).  If use is deemed absolutely necessary, close monitoring is crucial.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Dizziness, headache
* Cardiovascular: Edema (swelling)
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia (indigestion), flatulence (gas), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (bleeding), gastrointestinal perforation (hole in the GI tract), heartburn, nausea, ulcers (gastric, duodenal), vomiting
* Dermatologic: Pruritus (itching), skin rash
* Hematologic: Anemia, prolonged bleeding time
* Hepatic: Increased liver enzyme levels
* Otic: Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Renal: Renal function abnormality


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Blood disorders (agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver damage (hepatitis, hepatic failure)
* Kidney damage (renal failure, interstitial nephritis)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Piroxicam, like other NSAIDs, reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain signaling.  By blocking the enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) that create prostaglandins, piroxicam lessens the inflammatory response and provides pain relief.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Piroxicam is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to piroxicam or its components; those with a history of asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs; those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; those with recent or recurrent GI bleeding; active peptic ulcers; active GI inflammatory disease; inflammatory bowel disease; cerebrovascular bleeding or other bleeding disorders; severe liver impairment or active liver disease; severe renal impairment; known hyperkalemia; severe uncontrolled heart failure; children and adolescents under 16 years of age; use during the third trimester of pregnancy; and breastfeeding women.
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events (MI, stroke), gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.  Use with caution in patients with hypertension, edema, those performing tasks requiring alertness, history of GI ulcers, hepatic disease, coagulopathy, smokers, alcohol users, elderly or debilitated individuals, patients with asthma (excluding aspirin-sensitive asthma), decreased hepatic function, and poor CYP2C9 metabolizers.
* **Drug Interactions:** Piroxicam can interact with many other medications, including ACE inhibitors, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, digoxin, lithium, diuretics, and others. Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Piroxicam is categorized as pregnancy Category C before 30 weeks gestation and Category D after 30 weeks gestation due to increased risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.  Itâ€™s contraindicated during breastfeeding as it is excreted in breast milk.
