# Pembrolizumab

**Generic Name:** Pembrolizumab

**Usage:** Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy medication, specifically a checkpoint inhibitor, used to treat various types of cancers.  Its specific uses depend on the cancer type and stage and are often determined in consultation with an oncologist.  Common uses include:

* **Melanoma:**  Advanced melanoma (skin cancer) that has spread or cannot be surgically removed.
* **Lung Cancer:** Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both in previously treated patients and as first-line therapy in certain cases (often those with high PD-L1 expression).
* **Head and Neck Cancer:** Recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
* **Urothelial Cancer:**  Advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (bladder cancer).
* **Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma:**  After failure of other treatments.
* **Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) or Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) Cancers:**  Various cancer types with this genetic characteristic.
* **Other Cancers:** Pembrolizumab is also being investigated and used in other cancer types.


**Side Effects:** Pembrolizumab, like other immunotherapy drugs, can cause a range of side effects.  These can vary in severity from mild to severe and may occur during or after treatment.  Some common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Rash:** Skin rash or itching.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.
* **Decreased Appetite:** Loss of interest in eating.
* **Cough:** Persistent cough.
* **Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing.

**More serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These include:**

* **Infusion Reactions:** Reactions during the administration of the drug.
* **Pneumonitis:** Inflammation of the lungs.
* **Colitis:** Inflammation of the colon.
* **Hepatitis:** Inflammation of the liver.
* **Endocrine Disorders:** Problems with hormone production (e.g., thyroid problems).
* **Immune-related adverse events (irAEs):** A broad range of side effects caused by the immune system overreacting.  This is a major consideration with this class of drugs.


**How it Works:** Pembrolizumab works by blocking a protein called PD-1 (programmed death-1) on the surface of T cells (a type of immune cell).  Cancer cells often use PD-1 to evade the immune system. By blocking PD-1, pembrolizumab allows T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. This enhances the body's natural ability to fight cancer.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Pembrolizumab chemotherapy?** No, it is an immunotherapy drug, not chemotherapy.  It works by boosting the immune system rather than directly damaging cancer cells.

* **How is Pembrolizumab administered?** It's given intravenously (IV) by infusion in a doctor's office or clinic.

* **How long is the treatment course?** The length of treatment varies depending on the type of cancer, response to treatment, and the patient's overall health. It can range from several months to years.

* **What are the costs associated with Pembrolizumab?**  The cost can be substantial, and financial assistance programs may be available.  Discuss cost concerns with your doctor or a healthcare professional.

* **Who should not take Pembrolizumab?**  Individuals with certain underlying medical conditions or those who have had severe allergic reactions to pembrolizumab or similar medications should not use it.  This is crucial to discuss with your physician.
