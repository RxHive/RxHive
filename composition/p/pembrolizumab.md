# Pembrolizumab
### Generic Name
Pembrolizumab

### Usage

Pembrolizumab is a type of immunotherapy, specifically a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor.  It works by blocking the PD-1 protein, which is found on certain immune cells (T cells).  Cancer cells often use the PD-1 pathway to evade detection and destruction by the body's immune system. By blocking this pathway, pembrolizumab helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.

Pembrolizumab's primary use is in treating various types of cancer, including but not limited to:

* **Melanoma:**  Both advanced (unresectable or metastatic) and adjuvant (after surgery) melanoma.
* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):**  Advanced stages and as part of combination therapies.
* **Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC):**  Advanced or recurrent disease.
* **Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL):** Relapsed or refractory disease.
* **Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL):** Relapsed or refractory disease.
* **Urothelial carcinoma:** Both locally advanced/metastatic and high-risk, Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive disease.
* **Colorectal cancer:** Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancers.
* **Gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma:** Locally advanced or metastatic disease.
* **Cervical cancer:** Advanced or recurrent disease, used both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):** Advanced disease.
* **Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC):** Recurrent or metastatic disease.
* **Renal cell carcinoma:**  Often used in combination with other medications like axitinib or lenvatinib.
* **Triple-negative breast cancer:** Locally recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic disease.  Also used in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.
* **Small cell lung cancer:** Metastatic disease.
* **Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC):** Recurrent, metastatic, or locally advanced disease not curable by surgery or radiation.
* **Endometrial cancer:** Advanced disease, used both as single agent and in combination with lenvatinib.
* **Esophageal cancer:**  Advanced disease, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy.
* **Cancers with high tumor mutational burden (TMB):**  This is a broader category encompassing several cancer types with a high number of mutations.


It's crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the specific use of pembrolizumab will depend on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate use based on individual circumstances.


### Dosage

Pembrolizumab is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage varies significantly depending on the type of cancer being treated, the patient's weight, and whether it is used alone or in combination with other therapies.  The information below is a summary and **should not be used in place of a doctor's prescription**.  The prescribing information should be consulted for precise and up-to-date dosage details.

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage typically ranges from 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks, sometimes adjusted based on body weight (e.g., 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Treatment duration varies depending on the response to therapy and the presence of side effects.  Some treatment regimens continue for a specific number of cycles or months, even in the absence of disease progression, while others are continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Combination therapies involving pembrolizumab often have specific sequencing and duration guidelines that need careful attention.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Pembrolizumab dosage in children is based on body weight (usually 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks), with maximum doses established.  The specific conditions treated and treatment duration differ from the adult formulations, and these details must be obtained from a physician specializing in pediatric oncology.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on several factors, including hepatic and renal impairment, and the occurrence of specific side effects.  Close monitoring is needed to manage potential toxicities and make necessary adjustments.


### Side Effects

Pembrolizumab can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity. These include:

**Common Side Effects (affecting >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Pain
* Rash
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*  Changes in blood counts (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
*  Changes in liver function tests


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Immune-mediated adverse reactions (affecting various organs like the lungs, liver, kidneys, intestines, endocrine system, skin, and nervous system). These reactions can be severe and sometimes life-threatening. Examples include pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, nephritis, endocrinopathies (e.g., hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes), and various neurological problems.
* Infusion reactions
* Cardiac problems (e.g., myocarditis, pericarditis)
* Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)


**Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.**  Early intervention can often help manage side effects effectively.


### How it Works

Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the PD-1 protein on the surface of T cells. Cancer cells often express proteins (PD-L1 and PD-L2) that bind to PD-1, essentially putting the brakes on the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate them. By binding to PD-1, pembrolizumab blocks this interaction, releasing the "brakes" and allowing T cells to attack the cancer cells more effectively.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Individuals with a known hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its components should not receive it.
* **Immune-mediated adverse reactions:** Pembrolizumab carries a risk of causing serious immune-mediated side effects. Close monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms is crucial.
* **Other medications:** Pembrolizumab's effects can be altered by some medications.  Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with a healthcare professional.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Pembrolizumab can harm a developing fetus and should be avoided during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least four months after the final dose. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for four months following the final dose.
* **Specific populations:**  Extra caution may be needed in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, older adults, and those with underlying medical conditions.


### FAQs
