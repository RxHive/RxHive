# Pioglitazone + Vildagliptin

**Generic Name:** Pioglitazone + Vildagliptin (combination not currently available as a single fixed-dose combination pill in the US or EU.  The components are available separately.)


**Usage:**  Pioglitazone and vildagliptin are both used to treat type 2 diabetes.  They are *not* typically prescribed together as a single pill, but may be prescribed *separately* or in combination with other diabetes medications.  A doctor would make this decision based on an individual's needs and response to treatment.

* **Pioglitazone:** Improves insulin sensitivity in the body's tissues.
* **Vildagliptin:** Increases the body's production of incretins, hormones that stimulate insulin release and reduce glucagon secretion (glucagon raises blood sugar).


**Side Effects:**  The side effects listed below are for *both* pioglitazone and vildagliptin individually.  The specific side effects and their severity will vary depending on the individual and the specific dosage.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for more comprehensive information.

**Pioglitazone:**

* **Common:** Weight gain, fluid retention (edema), headache.
* **Serious:**  Heart failure (increased risk), bladder cancer (increased risk), bone fractures (increased risk), liver problems.


**Vildagliptin:**

* **Common:** Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nausea.
* **Serious:**  Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), allergic reactions.


**How it Works:**

* **Pioglitazone:**  This thiazolidinedione (TZD) works by making the body's cells more sensitive to insulin.  Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose (sugar) from the blood enter cells for energy. By improving insulin sensitivity, pioglitazone helps lower blood sugar levels.

* **Vildagliptin:** This dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor works by increasing the levels of incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) in the body. These hormones naturally increase insulin release after a meal and decrease glucagon secretion.  By increasing incretin levels, vildagliptin helps regulate blood sugar levels more effectively.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this a single pill?** No, a single pill containing both pioglitazone and vildagliptin is not currently available in many regions.  They are often prescribed separately.

* **Why might they be prescribed together?**  If a patient's blood sugar is not adequately controlled with one medication alone, a doctor may add a second medication, such as prescribing pioglitazone and vildagliptin separately to achieve better blood sugar control.

* **What are the risks of taking these medications?** Both pioglitazone and vildagliptin have potential side effects, some of which are serious.  It's crucial to discuss potential risks and benefits with your doctor before starting treatment.  Regular monitoring is essential.

* **Who should not take these medications?**  People with certain medical conditions, such as heart failure (pioglitazone), liver problems (both), or allergies to the medications should not take them.  Your doctor will determine if these medications are appropriate for you based on your health history.
