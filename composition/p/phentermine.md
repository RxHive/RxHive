# Phentermine
### Generic Name
Phentermine

### Usage
Phentermine is a medication primarily used as a short-term adjunct in weight loss programs for adults.  It's prescribed for individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater (obese) or a BMI of 27 or greater (overweight) in the presence of additional risk factors like diabetes, high cholesterol, or controlled high blood pressure.  Phentermine works by suppressing appetite, making it easier to stick to a calorie-restricted diet and exercise plan.  It's crucial to understand that phentermine is not a standalone solution for weight loss; it's most effective when combined with lifestyle changes.  Its use is limited to a few weeks due to the potential for tolerance and dependence.  There are no approved uses for phentermine in children under 16.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage of phentermine varies depending on the specific formulation (immediate-release or extended-release) and the individual's response.

* **Immediate-release (IR) Phentermine Hydrochloride:**  Typically, 15-37.5 mg per day, taken in one or two divided doses. Some formulations come as 8mg tablets, in which case the doctor might prescribe 8mg three times a day.  Orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) are also available with similar daily dosage range (15-37.5 mg) to be taken in the morning. Dosage is individualized to find the lowest effective dose.

* **Extended-release (ER) Phentermine Base:**  The starting dose is usually 30-40 mg once daily with breakfast. The maintenance dose can range from 15-40 mg once daily, also taken with breakfast.  Again, the lowest effective dose is targeted.

**Children and Adolescents:** Phentermine is generally not recommended for children under 16 years old.  For those aged 16 and older, the dosage may be the same as for adults, but always under strict medical supervision.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on individual factors like kidney function. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific instructions.  People with impaired kidney function may require lower doses or might not be suitable candidates for this drug.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness

### How it Works

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine, meaning it mimics the effects of certain natural body chemicals.  It primarily works in the central nervous system (brain) by increasing the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate appetite. This increase in norepinephrine suppresses appetite, leading to a reduction in food intake.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Phentermine should not be used by people with certain conditions such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or a history of drug abuse.  It's also contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those who have recently taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

* **Interactions:** Phentermine can interact with many other medications, especially MAOIs, certain antidepressants, and drugs that affect blood pressure.  It can also interact negatively with alcohol, so its consumption should be avoided while taking phentermine. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you take before starting phentermine.

* **Warnings:**  Phentermine carries an increased risk of heart problems, such as valvular heart disease and primary pulmonary hypertension.  It's crucial to be monitored regularly by a healthcare professional for blood pressure and heart function.  Potential for abuse and dependence exists.  Those with existing conditions like diabetes, kidney problems, or asthma should use phentermine with extreme caution.
