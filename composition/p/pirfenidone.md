# Pirfenidone
### Generic Name
Pirfenidone

### Usage

Pirfenidone is primarily used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by scarring and thickening of lung tissue, leading to shortness of breath and a persistent cough.  Pirfenidone helps to slow the progression of this disease, improving lung function and quality of life for many patients. While its primary use is in IPF, research is ongoing to explore its potential in other fibrotic conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis):**

Pirfenidone is administered orally.  The dosage is carefully titrated upward to minimize side effects.

* **Initial Titration:**
    * Days 1-7: 267 mg three times daily (TID) – total daily dose of 801 mg.
    * Days 8-14: 534 mg TID – total daily dose of 1602 mg.
    * Day 15 and onwards: 801 mg TID – total daily dose of 2403 mg (maximum recommended dose).

* **Maintenance Dosage:**  801 mg TID (2403 mg total daily dose).

* **Reinitiation after Interruption:** If treatment is interrupted for less than 14 days, the previous dose can be resumed.  If the interruption is 14 days or longer, the initial two-week titration process must be repeated.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Pirfenidone in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary depending on liver and kidney function, as well as interactions with other medications.  Consult your physician for guidance on dose modification.

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate impairment; it's not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Dosage may need to be reduced or therapy discontinued if liver enzyme levels rise significantly.

* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. It’s not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.

* **Concomitant Medications:** Pirfenidone's metabolism can be affected by other drugs.  Strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, enoxacin) require Pirfenidone dose reduction.  Moderate inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin) may also necessitate dose adjustment.  Consult your physician if you are taking other medications.

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe hepatotoxicity (liver damage)

**Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

The exact mechanism of action of Pirfenidone isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work through multiple pathways. It appears to reduce the production of proteins and cytokines involved in fibrosis (scarring) in the lungs.  It may also decrease the formation of extracellular matrix, the build-up of which contributes to the stiffening of lung tissue in IPF. Additionally, it may have anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the number of inflammatory cells in the lungs.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pirfenidone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

* **Interactions:**  Pirfenidone interacts with several medications, particularly those that affect the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (CYP1A2).  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:** Pirfenidone can cause dizziness and fatigue; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the drug affects you.  It can increase the risk of photosensitivity; avoid excessive sun exposure, use sunscreen (SPF 50 or higher), and wear protective clothing.  Regular monitoring of liver function is essential.  Quitting smoking is recommended before and during treatment.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pirfenidone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is uncertain.  The decision to breastfeed while taking Pirfenidone should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, considering the potential benefits of breastfeeding against the risk of infant exposure to the drug.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Pirfenidone?**  A:  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly while taking Pirfenidone, as it could increase the risk of liver damage and interact with the medication’s side effects. Discuss alcohol use with your physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Take the next scheduled dose as usual.

* **Q: How should I store Pirfenidone?** A: Store Pirfenidone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Pirfenidone suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking Pirfenidone without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation might be harmful.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Pirfenidone?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on individual response and disease progression. Your physician will determine the appropriate treatment length.
