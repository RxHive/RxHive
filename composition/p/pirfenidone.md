# Pirfenidone

**Generic Name:** Pirfenidone

**Usage:**

Pirfenidone is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic and progressive lung disease.  It's specifically indicated to slow the decline in lung function and reduce the worsening of symptoms in adults with mild to moderate IPF. It's not a cure for IPF, but it can help manage the disease and improve quality of life.

**Side Effects:**

Pirfenidone can cause a range of side effects, some common and others more serious.  The most common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), loss of appetite.
* **Skin reactions:** Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), rash, itching.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Weight loss:**

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests), hepatitis.  Liver function tests are usually monitored regularly while on this medication.
* **Severe skin reactions:** Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) â€“ these are rare but potentially life-threatening skin conditions.  Stop taking pirfenidone and seek immediate medical attention if you experience a severe skin reaction.
* **Interstitial lung disease:**  Paradoxically, some patients have experienced worsening of lung disease while taking pirfenidone.


**How it Works:**

The exact mechanism of how pirfenidone works in IPF is not fully understood. However, it's believed to have several effects that contribute to its benefit:

* **Anti-fibrotic effect:** It reduces the production of collagen and other proteins that contribute to the scarring and stiffening of lung tissue characteristic of IPF.
* **Anti-inflammatory effect:** It may reduce inflammation in the lungs.
* **Antioxidant effect:** It may protect lung cells from damage caused by free radicals.
