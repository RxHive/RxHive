# Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu.  Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever and relieves mild to moderate pain. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, providing temporary relief from nasal congestion.  It's typically used for symptoms like headache, muscle aches, fever, and stuffy nose.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Paracetamol:**  Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain.  Rare but serious side effects include liver damage (especially with overuse or alcohol consumption).
* **Phenylephrine:**  Increased blood pressure, nervousness, dizziness, headache, trouble sleeping, nausea.


Less common but more serious side effects can occur with either ingredient and require immediate medical attention. These may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Severe dizziness or fainting


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to reduce fever by affecting areas of the brain that regulate temperature. It also inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Phenylephrine:**  This is a sympathomimetic amine that acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels. This causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), reducing swelling and congestion in the nasal passages.
