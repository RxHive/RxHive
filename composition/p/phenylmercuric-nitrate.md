# Phenylmercuric Nitrate
### Generic Name
Phenylmercuric Nitrate

### Usage
Phenylmercuric nitrate is an organomercury compound with antiseptic and antifungal properties.  Historically, it was used as a topical disinfectant for wounds. However, due to its significant toxicity, particularly to the kidneys, this use has been discontinued.  Its primary current application is as an antimicrobial preservative, mainly found in some ophthalmic (eye) preparations.  It's important to note that long-term use (several years) has been linked to a brownish pigmentation of the eye's anterior lens capsule.  While it also possesses spermicidal activity, its use in vaginal contraceptives is no longer recommended.

### Dosage
There is no standard dosage for phenylmercuric nitrate as a medication for human consumption or topical application because its use in these ways is no longer considered safe or recommended. The concentration used as a preservative in ophthalmic preparations is highly variable and determined by the specific manufacturer.  Any information regarding dosage should be obtained directly from the product labeling.  **Never use phenylmercuric nitrate without explicit instructions from a healthcare professional.**

### Side Effects
* **Kidney damage:** This is a significant risk associated with phenylmercuric nitrate.
* **Brownish pigmentation of the eye lens:** This has been observed with prolonged exposure.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rashes or other allergic responses are possible.
* **Neurological effects:**  Although less common, organomercury compounds can affect the nervous system.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported immediately to a doctor or other healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Phenylmercuric nitrate inhibits the activity of several crucial enzymes involved in cellular respiration and energy production.  Specifically, it depresses the activity of cytochrome oxidase, succinoxidase, succinic, lactic, and glucose dehydrogenases, as well as catalase. By disrupting these enzymes, it interferes with the normal functioning of microbial cells, leading to their death or inhibited growth. This mechanism underlies its antiseptic and antifungal properties.


### Precautions
* **Highly Toxic:** Phenylmercuric nitrate is a toxic substance.  Avoid direct contact with skin and eyes. In case of accidental exposure, wash the affected area thoroughly with water. Seek medical attention if necessary.
* **Kidney Risk:**  The most significant risk is kidney damage. Individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions should strictly avoid exposure.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the potential harm to the developing fetus or infant.
* **Interactions with Other Drugs:** No specific drug interactions are well-documented, but its use should be disclosed to healthcare providers to ensure there are no potential negative consequences.
* **Children and Elderly:**  Use in children and the elderly should be avoided due to increased vulnerability to toxicity.

### FAQs
