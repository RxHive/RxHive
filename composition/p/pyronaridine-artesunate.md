# Pyronaridine + Artesunate
### Generic Name
Pyronaridine + Artesunate

### Usage
Pyronaridine and Artesunate is a fixed-dose combination antimalarial medication used to treat acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum* or *Plasmodium vivax*.  This combination therapy aims to improve patient adherence and reduce the risk of resistance associated with monotherapy (using a single antimalarial drug).  It's crucial to understand that this combination is *not* suitable for treating severe or complicated malaria.


### Dosage

The dosage of Pyronaridine and Artesunate is weight-based and administered orally once daily (OD) for three days.  The specific dose depends on the patient's weight:

* **Patients weighing 20 to <24 kg:** 180 mg Pyronaridine phosphate + 60 mg Artesunate
* **Patients weighing 24 to <45 kg:** 360 mg Pyronaridine phosphate + 120 mg Artesunate
* **Patients weighing 45 to <65 kg:** 540 mg Pyronaridine phosphate + 180 mg Artesunate
* **Patients weighing â‰¥65 kg:** 720 mg Pyronaridine phosphate + 240 mg Artesunate

**Pediatric Dosage:** The dosage for children is the same as for adults, based on their weight.  However, the safety and efficacy have not been established for children weighing over 20kg.  Always follow a healthcare professional's guidance on pediatric dosages.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The combination is contraindicated in patients with signs of hepatic impairment (liver damage) or severe renal impairment (kidney damage).  Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment should use this medication with caution under close medical supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Abdominal pain
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Headache
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Vomiting
* Hematological changes (changes in blood counts, such as eosinophilia, neutropenia, anemia, and increased platelet count)
* Abnormal laboratory test results
* Syncope (fainting)
* Isolated prolongation of the QTc interval (a measure of heart rhythm)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

Less common but potentially serious side effects can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or severe symptoms.


### How it Works

Pyronaridine works by inhibiting the formation of beta-hematin, a crucial process for the malaria parasite to neutralize heme (a toxic byproduct of hemoglobin digestion).  By preventing beta-hematin formation, Pyronaridine disrupts the parasite's ability to survive.  Artesunate, an artemisinin derivative, is believed to exert its antimalarial effect through several mechanisms, including the generation of free radicals within the parasite and the inhibition of its calcium-ATPase.  These actions ultimately lead to parasite death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Pyronaridine or Artesunate or any component of the formulation, those with signs of hepatic injury or known severe liver disease, and those with severe renal impairment.
* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, low hemoglobin, congenital prolongation of QTc interval, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmia, and heart failure.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Pyronaridine and Artesunate during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  Artemisinin compounds are generally not recommended in the first trimester.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; the benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against potential risks.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Always inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, to avoid potential interactions.
* **Severe Malaria:** This combination is not suitable for treating severe malaria, cerebral malaria, or other complicated forms of the disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Pyronaridine and Artesunate with food?** A: No specific dietary restrictions are necessary; it can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I vomit after taking a dose?** A: If vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of the first dose, repeat the dose. If the repeated dose is also vomited, seek alternative antimalarial treatment.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, then continue with the regular schedule.
* **Q: Can I use this medication for malaria prevention?** A: No, this medication is only for treating acute, uncomplicated malaria, not for prevention.
* **Q: Is this medication safe for people with HIV/AIDS?** A: The safety and efficacy in patients with HIV/AIDS haven't been fully established.  Close monitoring is needed if used in these patients.
* **Q:  What monitoring is needed while taking this medication?** A: Liver function tests and parasite loads (especially in HIV patients and those with severe diarrhea/vomiting) may be monitored.
