# Protirelin
### Generic Name
Protirelin

### Usage
Protirelin is a synthetic version of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a naturally occurring hormone in the body.  Its primary use is in diagnostic testing to assess the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. This means it helps doctors determine if the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland are working together correctly.  The test involves administering protirelin and measuring the subsequent release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).  An inadequate TSH response can indicate problems within the HPT axis.

Beyond diagnostic use, protirelin has shown some efficacy in treating certain neurological conditions. Specifically, it's been used to treat persistent impaired or altered consciousness (excluding coma or semi-coma) resulting from head trauma or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and to improve ataxia (lack of muscle control) symptoms in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration.  However, its use in these therapeutic applications is less common and may be considered off-label in some contexts.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use and patient characteristics.  Always follow the prescription provided by your healthcare professional.  The following information is for general understanding and should not substitute medical advice:

* **Diagnostic TRH Test (Adults):**  0.2-0.5 mg intravenously (IV) or 0.5 mg subcutaneously (SC) as a single dose.  Repeat testing requires a 7-14 day waiting period to allow endogenous TRH secretion to recover.
* **Diagnostic TRH Test (Children):**  For children â‰¤ 50 kg, the dose is 1 mcg/kg IV. For children > 50 kg, the adult dosage applies.  Again, a 7-14 day waiting period between tests is necessary.
* **Treatment of Impaired/Altered Consciousness (Adults):**  0.5-2 mg IV daily for up to 10 days, depending on response. The dosage is higher for subarachnoid hemorrhage (2 mg daily).
* **Treatment of Spinocerebellar Degeneration (Adults):**  Initial dose is 0.5-2 mg IV or IM daily for 2-3 weeks.  After a 2-3 week break, the treatment may be repeated or administered 2-3 times per week.

**Important Note:**  Dosages are expressed as protirelin base.  Protirelin tartrate contains a higher weight of the active compound (0.5 mg protirelin base is equivalent to 0.732 mg protirelin tartrate).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10% or more):**

* Cardiovascular: Increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, chest tightness
* Nervous System: Paresthesia (tingling), unusual taste
* Gastrointestinal: Hunger, vomiting, dry mouth (xerostomia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Frequency not always defined):**

* Cardiovascular:  Altered blood pressure, changes in pulse, palpitations, edema, flushing, shock
* Nervous System: Anxiety, dizziness, headache, insomnia, loss of consciousness, malaise, vertigo, seizures (rare, post-marketing reports)
* Dermatologic:  Diaphoresis (sweating), pruritus (itching), skin rash
* Endocrine/Metabolic: Pituitary apoplexy (in patients with pituitary adenoma)
* Gastrointestinal:  Abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia
* Genitourinary: Breast hypertrophy, lactation, urinary urgency
* Hematologic: Anemia, leukopenia
* Hepatic: Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Other: Fever, exacerbation of asthma

If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Protirelin acts as a stimulant for the release of TSH from the anterior pituitary gland.  The pituitary gland then signals the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). By measuring the TSH response to protirelin, doctors can assess the function of the entire HPT axis.  In therapeutic applications, the increased TSH and subsequent thyroid hormone release are believed to contribute to the observed improvements in neurological function.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Protirelin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, severe bronchial obstruction, or increased risk of spasms, convulsions, or tetany.
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with bronchial asthma (excluding severe cases), cardiac arrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, ischemic heart disease, epilepsy, severe hypopituitarism, or large pituitary tumors.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several medications can affect the TSH response to protirelin, including adrenocorticoids, aspirin, levodopa and other dopaminergic medications, and thyroid hormones. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Protirelin crosses the placenta and is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for protirelin to work?** A: For diagnostic purposes, TSH levels are usually measured 30 minutes after injection. Therapeutic effects, when used, may take longer to manifest.
* **Q: How is protirelin administered?** A: Administration can be intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or subcutaneous (SC), depending on the intended use and dosage.
* **Q: How should protirelin be stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions on your medication's label.
* **Q: Can I take protirelin with other medications?** A: Discuss any other medications or supplements you take with your healthcare provider before using protirelin to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of protirelin?** A: Long-term effects are generally not a concern with single-dose diagnostic testing.  For therapeutic uses, potential long-term effects would need to be discussed with a physician.
