# Promethazine
### Generic Name
Promethazine

### Usage

Promethazine is a first-generation antihistamine with multiple uses.  Its primary function is to relieve allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itching.  However, it's also frequently used as an antiemetic (to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting), particularly after surgery or anesthesia, and to manage motion sickness.  Additionally, it's sometimes used as a sedative, especially pre- or post-operatively or to help induce sleep.  It's important to note that while some uses, like nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, are considered off-label, they are sometimes prescribed by healthcare professionals.


### Dosage

Promethazine dosage varies greatly depending on the reason for use, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (oral, intramuscular [IM], or intravenous [IV]).  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage instructions precisely.  

**Adults:** Dosages for adults range from 6.25mg to 75mg per dose, depending on the indication and route of administration.  For allergies, a common starting dose is 25mg at bedtime, while for nausea and vomiting, it might be 12.5-25mg every 4-6 hours as needed.  For motion sickness, a typical initial dose is 25mg 30-60 minutes before travel, with subsequent doses as needed.  Pre-operative or post-operative sedation often involves higher doses administered by a healthcare professional.

**Children:**  Promethazine should **not** be used in children under 2 years old due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression.  For children aged 2 years and older, dosages are calculated based on weight and are significantly lower than adult doses.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage.

**Important Note:**  Intravenous administration of Promethazine should be avoided due to the risk of severe tissue damage. Intramuscular injection is the preferred parenteral route.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of Promethazine include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements)
* Respiratory depression (especially in children)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a rare but serious condition affecting the nervous system)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative that acts in several ways.  It blocks histamine receptors (H1 receptors), responsible for allergic reactions, thus reducing allergy symptoms. It also affects dopamine receptors in the brain, contributing to its antiemetic and sedative effects.  Its antiemetic action also involves blocking other neurotransmitters in the brain that trigger nausea and vomiting.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Promethazine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to promethazine or other phenothiazines, coma, and children under 2 years old.  It's also not to be used for treating lower respiratory tract symptoms, particularly asthma.

* **Drug Interactions:** Promethazine can interact with many other medications, including alcohol, other sedatives, and certain antidepressants.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Promethazine is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on the fetus are not fully understood.  It's crucial to discuss its use with your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Special Populations:** Older adults and those with certain medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney problems, glaucoma, or seizures should use Promethazine with caution under strict medical supervision.

* **Injection Site:**  Intramuscular injection should be given deep into the muscle to reduce the risk of tissue damage.  Subcutaneous and intravenous administration is generally avoided.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Promethazine to work?**  A: The onset of action depends on the route of administration and the intended use. Oral administration can take 30-60 minutes, while IM or IV administration is much faster.

* **Q: Can I drive after taking Promethazine?**  A: No. Promethazine causes drowsiness, impairing driving ability. Avoid operating machinery or engaging in activities requiring alertness.

* **Q: How should I store Promethazine?**  A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I take Promethazine with other medications?**  A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining Promethazine with other medications to avoid potential interactions.
