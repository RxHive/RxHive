# Promethazine

**Generic Name:** Promethazine Hydrochloride

**Usage:** Promethazine is used to treat allergy symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, and itching.  It's also used to reduce nausea and vomiting, and to help with sedation before or after surgery or other medical procedures.  It can be used alone or in combination with other medications.  Important note:  Promethazine is a controlled substance in some countries and its use should always be as prescribed by a physician.  Self-medicating with promethazine is dangerous.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and nausea.  More serious, though less common, side effects can include:

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  These involve involuntary muscle movements and can be particularly concerning in children.
* **Respiratory depression:**  Slowed or difficult breathing. This is especially dangerous in individuals with pre-existing respiratory issues.
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can cause dizziness and fainting.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** Promethazine is an antihistamine with sedative and antiemetic (anti-nausea) properties.  It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergy symptoms.  Its antiemetic effect is thought to be due to its action on the central nervous system.  The sedative effect is also due to its central nervous system effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Is promethazine habit-forming?**  Promethazine can be habit-forming, especially at higher doses or with prolonged use.  It's crucial to follow prescribed dosages and duration.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking promethazine?** No. Alcohol significantly increases the sedative effects of promethazine and can lead to dangerous consequences, including respiratory depression.
* **Can I take promethazine with other medications?**  It's important to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions can occur. Certain combinations can be dangerous.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **What are the signs of an overdose?**  Signs of a promethazine overdose include severe drowsiness, confusion, slowed breathing, seizures, and coma.  Seek immediate medical attention if an overdose is suspected.
* **Is promethazine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Promethazine should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor before using promethazine if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Can children take promethazine?**  Promethazine can be used in children, but only under strict medical supervision due to the risk of EPS.  The dosage and administration will be carefully determined by a physician.
