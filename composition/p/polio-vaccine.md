# Polio Vaccine
### Generic Name
Polio Vaccine (Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine - IPV)

### Usage
The inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio), a debilitating and potentially fatal infectious disease caused by the poliovirus.  Polio primarily affects children under five years old, causing paralysis.  IPV is highly effective in preventing polio and is part of routine childhood immunization schedules worldwide.  There are no notable secondary uses beyond preventing polio.

### Dosage

**IPV is administered as an injection, typically intramuscularly (IM).**  There is no oral form of IPV. The exact dosage and schedule vary slightly depending on the specific vaccine formulation and national immunization recommendations, but generally:

* **Children:**  The standard schedule typically involves a series of shots, usually given at 2 months, 4 months, and 6-18 months of age, with a booster dose given between 4-6 years of age.  Precise timing should always be determined by a healthcare professional.
* **Adults:** Adults who were not fully vaccinated as children may need a series of IPV shots to achieve full protection, with the number and timing determined by their vaccination history and the recommendation of their doctor. Some adults may only need a single booster dose.
* **Special Considerations:**  Individuals with weakened immune systems might require different dosing schedules, and their doctors will provide tailored recommendations.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to consult with a physician or other qualified healthcare provider regarding the specific dosage and schedule for IPV administration.  They can assess individual health circumstances and provide the most appropriate guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of IPV are generally mild and may include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
* Fever
* Fussiness or irritability

Less common, but more serious side effects are rare, but it's important to seek medical attention immediately if they occur:

* Allergic reactions (e.g., difficulty breathing, hives, swelling)


### How it Works

The IPV vaccine contains inactivated (killed) polioviruses.  When injected, these inactive viruses trigger the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the poliovirus.  These antibodies provide long-lasting protection, preventing the virus from causing infection and paralysis if encountered in the future.  The body learns to recognize and fight off the poliovirus without actually causing the disease.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to any component of the vaccine (including neomycin or streptomycin) should not receive IPV.  Inform your doctor of any allergies before vaccination.
* **Immune Deficiency:**  Individuals with severely weakened immune systems might have a reduced response to the vaccine.  Their doctor will carefully weigh the benefits and risks.
* **Pregnancy:** While IPV is generally considered safe during pregnancy, it's essential to discuss vaccination with a doctor to determine the optimal timing.
* **Interactions:** IPV does not generally interact with other medications, but it's always advisable to inform your physician about all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is the IPV vaccine safe?** A:  Yes, IPV is a very safe and effective vaccine with an excellent safety record.  Like all medications, there's a potential for side effects, but serious side effects are rare.
* **Q:  How long does the protection from IPV last?** A:  The protection provided by IPV is generally long-lasting, often decades, but booster shots might be recommended depending on individual circumstances and public health recommendations.
* **Q: What should I do if my child develops a fever after the vaccine?** A:  A mild fever is a common side effect.  You can give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce the fever, following age-appropriate dosing instructions.  If the fever is high or persists, contact your doctor.
* **Q: How is the IPV vaccine stored?** A:  IPV must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically in a refrigerator at a specific temperature range. Improper storage can compromise vaccine efficacy.  Always follow the instructions provided with the vaccine.
* **Q: Is IPV different from the oral polio vaccine (OPV)?** A: Yes, IPV uses inactivated poliovirus, while OPV uses a weakened (attenuated) live virus.  IPV is generally preferred due to its higher safety profile, eliminating the extremely rare risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis which can occur with OPV.
