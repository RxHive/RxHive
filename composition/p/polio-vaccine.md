# Polio Vaccine

**Generic Name:** Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV)

**Usage:**  IPV is used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio), a serious viral infection that can cause paralysis.  It is administered as a series of injections, typically starting in infancy and continuing through childhood. The exact schedule varies by country and health recommendations.  IPV is also used in booster shots for adults in some situations.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and uncommon. They can include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
* Fever.
* Headache.
* Muscle aches.
* Fatigue.
* Allergic reactions (rare, but serious).

Serious side effects are extremely rare.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of an allergic reaction such as difficulty breathing, hives, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.

**How it Works:** IPV contains inactivated (killed) polioviruses.  When injected, the vaccine introduces these inactive viruses to the body's immune system.  The immune system recognizes these viruses as foreign invaders and produces antibodies against them.  These antibodies provide long-lasting protection against future infection with live polioviruses.  Importantly, because the viruses are inactivated, the vaccine cannot cause polio.

**FAQs:**

* **Is IPV safe?** Yes, IPV is a very safe and effective vaccine.  The benefits of preventing polio far outweigh the very small risks of side effects.

* **How many doses are needed?**  The number of doses required varies depending on the vaccination schedule recommended by the relevant health authority. Typically, multiple doses are given in infancy and childhood to ensure complete protection.

* **What is the difference between IPV and OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine)?** IPV uses inactivated poliovirus, while OPV uses a weakened (attenuated) live virus. OPV offers herd immunity but carries a very small risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP). IPV is considered safer in this regard and is the predominantly used vaccine globally.

* **Can I get polio from the IPV vaccine?** No.  The polioviruses in IPV are inactivated and cannot cause polio.

* **What if I missed a dose?** Consult your doctor or healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.  They will likely recommend catching up on the missed doses as soon as possible.

* **Are there any contraindications for IPV?**  Individuals with severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine should not receive it.  Pregnant women may be advised to discuss vaccination timing with their doctor. Those with compromised immune systems may need to discuss vaccination with their physician.
