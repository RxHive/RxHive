# Placenta Extract
### Generic Name
Placenta Extract

### Usage

Placenta extract, derived from the human placenta, has shown promise in several therapeutic areas, though its use remains somewhat controversial and is not universally accepted.  In some regions, like Japan, pharmaceutical-grade placenta extract is used in the treatment of menopause and chronic hepatitis.  In India, it's used as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), primarily via intramuscular injection. Topical formulations are also employed in wound healing.  It's crucial to note that the FDA has expressed concerns about the safety of placenta extract, and its use is subject to restrictions and warnings in certain cosmetic applications.  The therapeutic uses described here represent specific regional practices and should not be interpreted as universally endorsed medical treatments.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the form of the medication (topical cream/gel or intramuscular injection).  

**Wound Healing (Topical):**  Creams or gels (containing 0.1g of fresh human placenta per gram) are typically applied directly to the affected area three or four times a day (TID or QID).

**Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) (Intramuscular):**  A 2 mL intramuscular injection daily is administered, always in conjunction with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of placenta extract in children have not been established, and its use is not recommended in this population.

### Side Effects

Common side effects from topical application may include:

* Application-site irritation
* Burning sensation
* Tingling sensation
* Skin inflammation

The frequency of these side effects is not well-defined in available literature.  Serious side effects are not commonly reported but if any adverse reactions occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

The exact mechanism of action of placenta extract is not fully understood, but its therapeutic effects are believed to stem from several factors. It is hypothesized to increase blood flow to the affected area and elevate levels of certain proteins (hormones) that promote tissue regeneration and wound healing with minimal scarring. In the context of PID, it exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, potentially by modulating the body's immunological response and preventing complications.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications are formally reported in the manufacturer's labeling. However, given the potential risks associated with using products derived from human tissue,  strict adherence to sterile procedures and appropriate medical oversight is paramount.

**Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are not extensively documented. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you are taking before using placenta extract.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of placenta extract during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Avoid using it during pregnancy or breastfeeding unless explicitly advised by a healthcare provider.

**General Considerations:** Topical preparations are for external use only.  Maintain hygiene during application.  For intramuscular injections, missed doses should not be doubled.  Avoid contact with eyes; if contact occurs, rinse thoroughly and seek medical advice if irritation persists.

### FAQs

**Q: Is placenta extract safe?** A:  The safety profile of placenta extract is not fully established.  The FDA has expressed concerns, and its use is subject to restrictions in certain contexts.  Always consult a doctor before using it.

**Q: How is placenta extract stored?** A: Storage guidelines vary depending on the formulation (cream, gel, injection). Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

**Q: Can I use placenta extract for every type of wound?** A:  No. Its use should be guided by a healthcare professional who can assess the wound's type and suitability for this treatment.

**Q:  Is placenta extract a replacement for conventional medical treatments?** A:  No. In most instances, placenta extract is used as an adjunct therapy and not as a primary treatment.
