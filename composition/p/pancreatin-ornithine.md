# Pancreatin + Ornithine
### Generic Name
Pancreatin + Ornithine

**Note:**  Pancreatin and Ornithine are often combined in supplements, not typically as a single FDA-approved medication.  The information below pertains to the individual components and their combined use as found in over-the-counter supplements.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using any supplement, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.  There is limited robust clinical research on the specific combination of Pancreatin and Ornithine.


### Usage

**Pancreatin:** This enzyme supplement contains pancreatic enzymes – amylase, lipase, and protease – that aid in digestion. It's primarily used to treat conditions where the pancreas doesn't produce enough of these enzymes, leading to insufficient digestion of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. These conditions include chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and following pancreatic surgery.  It can also be used to alleviate symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and steatorrhea (fatty stools) associated with these conditions.

**Ornithine:** This amino acid is often included in supplements aimed at improving liver function and reducing ammonia levels.  Ammonia buildup can occur in liver disease, leading to hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction). Ornithine may help the liver process ammonia more efficiently. Some studies suggest it may also promote sleep and reduce fatigue.

**Combined Use:** The combination of Pancreatin and Ornithine in supplements is often marketed to support digestive health and liver function, particularly for individuals with digestive issues or concerns about ammonia levels. However, it's crucial to understand that the evidence supporting this combined use is limited and requires further research.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific product, the individual's condition, and the healthcare provider's recommendations.  There's no standard dosage for a combined Pancreatin and Ornithine supplement.  

**Pancreatin:**  Dosage is typically determined by the amount of lipase (a key enzyme) present.  Doses range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of lipase units per dose, and the number of doses per day depends on the severity of symptoms and the individual’s needs.  Dosage instructions will be clearly specified on the product label.  Always follow those instructions.

**Ornithine:**  Ornithine supplements usually come in capsules or tablets. Dosage recommendations vary, but common ranges are in the hundreds of milligrams per day, often split into multiple doses.


**Important Note:**  Dosage information for both Pancreatin and Ornithine must be obtained from the specific product labeling and/or your healthcare provider.  Self-adjusting dosages can be harmful.

### Side Effects

**Pancreatin:** Common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and allergic reactions (rash, itching).  Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include elevated uric acid levels and formation of kidney stones.

**Ornithine:** Generally well-tolerated, but side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and possibly allergic reactions.

**Combined Supplement:** The side effects of a Pancreatin and Ornithine combination would likely be similar to those of the individual components.


### How it Works

**Pancreatin:** Replaces or supplements the body's deficient pancreatic enzymes, thereby improving digestion of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.  This reduces symptoms associated with inadequate digestion.

**Ornithine:** Aids in the liver's urea cycle, facilitating the conversion of ammonia to urea, a less toxic compound that is easily excreted from the body.  This helps manage ammonia levels and potentially reduces symptoms associated with ammonia buildup.

### Precautions

* **Pancreatin:**  Individuals with a history of pancreatitis should use pancreatin with caution under strict medical supervision.  It should not be used if you are allergic to pork products (as it is often derived from pig pancreas).
* **Ornithine:** While generally safe, individuals with kidney disease should use ornithine cautiously under medical guidance.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Both pancreatin and ornithine might interact with other medications.  Consult with a healthcare provider before using this combination if you are on any other medication, particularly those affecting the liver or kidneys.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult with a healthcare provider before using either pancreatin or ornithine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Children:** The use in children should always be under the strict supervision of a physician, with dosage carefully adjusted to the child's weight and needs.
