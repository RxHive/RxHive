# Pancreatin + Ornithine

**Generic Name:** Pancreatin + Ornithine Aspartate (Note:  Ornithine is often combined with aspartate to improve absorption and tolerability.)

**Usage:**

Pancreatin + Ornithine aspartate is typically used to treat symptoms associated with insufficient pancreatic enzyme production (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency), often seen in conditions like chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, and after pancreatic surgery.  The combination aims to improve both digestive function and liver function.

* **Pancreatin:** Replaces the digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, protease) the pancreas doesn't produce adequately, aiding in the digestion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. This leads to improved nutrient absorption and reduced symptoms like steatorrhea (fatty stools), bloating, abdominal pain, and weight loss.
* **Ornithine Aspartate:**  Its role is less well-established in this combination. It's believed to support liver function, potentially helping to reduce ammonia levels (a byproduct of protein metabolism that can accumulate in liver disease).  It might also help reduce fatigue and improve overall well-being in some patients.  However, the evidence supporting these benefits specifically in combination with pancreatin is limited.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally related to the pancreatin component:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, constipation
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including skin rashes, hives, and in severe cases, anaphylaxis.
* **Hyperuricemia (increased uric acid):**  Rare.
* **Rare side effects:**  Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas - this is serious and requires immediate medical attention).  This is more likely if the dosage is too high.

Ornithine aspartate generally has a good safety profile, but some people may experience mild gastrointestinal upset.

**How it Works:**

* **Pancreatin:** Replaces missing pancreatic enzymes.  These enzymes break down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed in the small intestine. This improves nutrient absorption and reduces symptoms of maldigestion.
* **Ornithine Aspartate:**  The precise mechanism isn't fully understood in this context.  It's thought to influence the urea cycle (the process of removing ammonia from the body), possibly reducing ammonia levels and supporting liver function.  Its effects on overall well-being and fatigue in this combination are not definitively proven.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this a prescription medication?** A:  Usually, yes. The dosage and specific combination need to be determined by a doctor.
* **Q:  How long will I need to take this medication?** A:  This depends on the underlying condition. It might be a long-term treatment.
* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A:  Yes, consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications, especially those affecting the liver or pancreas.
* **Q: Can I take this medication while pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Consult your doctor before taking this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects might resolve on their own.  Severe or persistent side effects require immediate medical attention.  Contact your doctor.
* **Q: Can I take over-the-counter pancreatin instead?** A:  While OTC pancreatin is available, it's crucial to consult a doctor for diagnosis and to determine the appropriate dose and formulation (especially considering the addition of ornithine aspartate).  Self-treating can be risky.
