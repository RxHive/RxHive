# Pentoxifylline
### Generic Name
Pentoxifylline

### Usage
Pentoxifylline's primary use is in treating intermittent claudication, a symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD).  PAD involves narrowed arteries in the limbs, reducing blood flow and causing pain, especially during exercise. Pentoxifylline helps improve blood flow to the affected areas, easing the pain and improving walking ability.  While its primary indication is for intermittent claudication, pentoxifylline is sometimes used off-label in other conditions, such as venous leg ulcers (often in conjunction with compression therapy) and severe alcoholic hepatitis (when other treatments are contraindicated).  It's crucial to understand that pentoxifylline treats symptoms and doesn't address the underlying cause of PAD (e.g., arterial blockage).  More definitive treatments like surgery or angioplasty may still be necessary.  The use of pentoxifylline for intermittent claudication refractory to exercise therapy and smoking cessation is increasingly questioned by medical professionals.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's individual factors.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Intermittent Claudication (Adults):** The typical starting dose is 400 mg three times daily (TID).  If gastrointestinal or central nervous system side effects occur, the dose might be reduced to 400 mg twice daily (BID).  Discontinue the medication if side effects persist.  It usually takes 2-4 weeks to see maximal benefit, and continued treatment for at least 8 weeks is often recommended.

* **Venous Leg Ulcers (Adults, Off-Label):**  The typical dose is also 400 mg TID, usually used in combination with compression therapy.

* **Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis (Adults, Off-Label):** A dose of 400 mg TID for four weeks may be used in severe cases (Maddrey Discriminant Function [MDF] score â‰¥ 32) where corticosteroids are not appropriate.

* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of pentoxifylline in children have not been established.  There are some off-label uses, such as adjunctive therapy for Kawasaki disease, but these require careful consideration and monitoring by a specialist.  Dosage in such cases would be determined by the physician based on the child's weight.  For example, in adjunctive Kawasaki disease treatment, it may be 20 mg/kg/day divided into three doses.


* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Individuals with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments.  Consult your physician for the appropriate regimen.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) include nausea and vomiting. Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Anaphylactic shock
* Anaphylactoid reaction
* Angioedema
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hepatitis
* Changes in liver enzyme levels
* Skin rash
* Gastrointestinal disturbances (bloating, flatulence, constipation)
* Nervous system effects (headache, dizziness, insomnia)
* Blood disorders (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Pentoxifylline improves blood flow in the microcirculation (tiny blood vessels). While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it is believed to work through several pathways:

* **Reducing blood viscosity:** This makes the blood less thick and easier to flow.
* **Increasing erythrocyte flexibility:** Red blood cells become more pliable, allowing them to pass more easily through narrowed vessels.
* **Improving leukocyte deformability:** White blood cells also become more flexible, aiding blood flow.
* **Decreasing neutrophil adhesion and activation:**  This reduces inflammation and improves blood flow to tissues.


These combined effects lead to improved tissue oxygenation.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Pentoxifylline is contraindicated in patients with a history of intolerance to pentoxifylline or xanthines, recent cerebral or retinal hemorrhage, acute myocardial infarction or severe coronary artery disease, or current or recent peptic ulcers.

* **Drug Interactions:** Pentoxifylline can interact with various medications, including those affecting platelet function, blood pressure, and blood clotting.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with liver or kidney impairment, and in older adults due to increased risk of adverse effects.  Pentoxifylline should be used cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.  The decision to use it in these situations requires careful consideration by both the patient and the physician.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew the tablets?** A: No.  Swallow the tablets whole, especially extended-release formulations.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: How should I store pentoxifylline?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: How long will it take before I see results?** A: It usually takes 2-4 weeks to see maximal improvement in symptoms.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking pentoxifylline?** A:  It's best to avoid excessive alcohol consumption, especially if you have liver disease.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I stop taking pentoxifylline suddenly?** A: No.  Always talk to your doctor before stopping the medication, as sudden cessation can have unintended consequences.
