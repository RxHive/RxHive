# Pexidartinib
### Generic Name
Pexidartinib

### Usage
Pexidartinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant-cell tumor (TGCT).  This medication is specifically indicated for individuals whose TGCT causes significant health problems (severe morbidity) or functional limitations and cannot be effectively treated with surgery.  It's important to note that pexidartinib is not a first-line treatment for TGCT; it's reserved for cases where other options haven't been successful.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Tenosynovial Giant-Cell Tumor):**

The typical oral dose is 400 mg twice daily (BID) until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments aren't specifically defined for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, individuals with active liver or biliary tract disease should avoid using pexidartinib.  If hepatotoxicity develops during treatment (elevated liver enzymes), the dose may need to be reduced or the medication stopped, based on the severity of the liver enzyme elevation.  Close monitoring of liver function tests is crucial.

* **Renal Impairment:** For individuals with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 15â€“89 mL/min, the dose should be reduced to 200 mg in the morning and 400 mg in the evening (total 600 mg/day).  Pexidartinib is not typically removed by dialysis.

* **Concomitant Medications:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary if pexidartinib is used with strong CYP3A inhibitors or UGT inhibitors (certain other medications). Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance.  Avoid using pexidartinib with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); alternative antacids should be considered.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of pexidartinib in children haven't been established.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Pexidartinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that primarily targets the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R).  CSF1R is a protein involved in the growth and development of certain cells, including those found in TGCTs. By blocking CSF1R, pexidartinib helps to inhibit the growth and proliferation of these tumor cells, leading to tumor shrinkage and symptom relief. It also inhibits KIT and FLT3, though the clinical significance of this is less well understood in the context of TGCT.

### Precautions

* **Hepatotoxicity:** Pexidartinib can cause serious and potentially fatal liver damage.  Regular monitoring of liver function is essential.
* **Pregnancy:**  Pexidartinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is not known whether pexidartinib is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pexidartinib can interact with other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing its effects.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS):** Pexidartinib is available only through a restricted REMS program due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I take pexidartinib?** A: Take it orally, as directed by your doctor. It's generally recommended to take it on an empty stomach.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store pexidartinib?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you have any concerning side effects.

* **Q:  Is pexidartinib right for everyone with TGCT?** A: No, it's typically reserved for patients with symptomatic TGCT who haven't responded well to other treatments, including surgery.
