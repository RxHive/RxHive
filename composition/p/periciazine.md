# Periciazine
### Generic Name
Periciazine

### Usage
Periciazine is a first-generation antipsychotic medication primarily used as an *adjunctive* therapy in managing certain symptoms of psychosis.  This means it's not typically used as a standalone treatment but rather to augment the effects of other treatments already in place. Its main role is in controlling symptoms like hostility, impulsivity, and aggression in patients already diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who are experiencing these behavioral problems. It's important to note that Periciazine is not a first-line treatment for psychosis itself.

### Dosage

**Adults (Psychosis):**  Periciazine is administered orally.  The starting dose is typically 5-20 mg in the morning and 10-40 mg in the evening.  The maintenance dose is the lowest effective dose, which is determined individually based on patient response and tolerance. Lower starting doses (2.5-15 mg morning, 5-30 mg evening) might be considered, particularly for elderly patients, who should begin with approximately 5 mg/day.  Doses exceeding 30 mg/day are seldom necessary.

**Children and Adolescents (Psychosis; â‰¥5 years old):** Oral administration is used. The initial dose is 2.5-10 mg in the morning and 5-30 mg in the evening.  Similar to adults, dosage should be increased gradually, based on the child's response and tolerance.  Always follow a healthcare professional's guidance for pediatric dosages.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for renal impairment.  Periciazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects

Periciazine, like other antipsychotics, can cause a range of side effects.  Common side effects include: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, insomnia, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as tremors, muscle stiffness, and restlessness.  

Less common, but more serious, side effects can include:

*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): A rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
*   Tardive dyskinesia:  A late-onset movement disorder that can be irreversible.
*   Cardiac arrhythmias:  Including QT prolongation, which can increase the risk of fatal cardiac events.
*   Blood disorders:  Such as agranulocytosis (a severe decrease in white blood cells).
*   Photosensitivity: Increased sensitivity of the skin to sunlight.

If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works

Periciazine is a phenothiazine derivative that works primarily by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with many brain functions, including movement, mood, and cognition. By blocking dopamine receptors, Periciazine reduces the activity of dopamine, thereby helping to control certain symptoms of psychosis, such as aggression and impulsivity.  It also has sedative properties, contributing to its effect on agitated behavior.  Additionally, it's believed to suppress the release of certain hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Periciazine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or related compounds, hepatic dysfunction, circulatory collapse, blood dyscrasias, those receiving spinal or regional anesthesia, or those with seizure disorders.  It should also be avoided in patients with altered states of consciousness or coma, particularly if caused by CNS depressants.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Periciazine can interact with many other medications.  It may enhance the effects of other sedatives (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates) and anticholinergic drugs.  It can also interact with medications affecting blood pressure, blood sugar, and the heart.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Periciazine during pregnancy has not been established, and its use during the third trimester may increase the risk of neonatal complications.  It's not recommended during breastfeeding.
*   **Specific Populations:**  Older adults, children, and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., heart problems, diabetes, liver or kidney disease) require careful monitoring while taking Periciazine.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take Periciazine to work?**  A: The onset of therapeutic effects varies from person to person but can take several days or weeks.
*   **Q: Can I stop taking Periciazine suddenly?** A: No. Abruptly stopping Periciazine can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before changing your dosage or discontinuing treatment.  The medication should be tapered off gradually.
*   **Q: How should I store Periciazine?** A: Store Periciazine as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Periciazine?** A:  No.  Alcohol can increase the sedative effects of Periciazine and should be avoided.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take two doses at once.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about missed doses.
