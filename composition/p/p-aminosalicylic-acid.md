# P-aminosalicylic Acid
### Generic Name
P-aminosalicylic Acid (PAS)

### Usage
Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), also known as 4-aminosalicylic acid, is primarily used as a second-line antibiotic in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  It's most often employed in combination with other anti-TB drugs when the infection is resistant to first-line treatments (multidrug-resistant TB) or when a patient can't tolerate other medications.  While its primary role is in TB treatment, PAS has also shown some use in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease, though this is less common.

### Dosage

**Tuberculosis (Adult):**  PAS is *always* used in combination with other anti-tubercular agents. The typical oral dosage is 8-12 grams per day, divided into 2-3 doses.  For the calcium salt form (aminosalicylate calcium), the dosage is 10-15 grams per day, also divided.

**Tuberculosis (Pediatric):** For children weighing 40 kg or less and adolescents under 15, the dosage is 200-300 mg/kg/day, usually divided into 2-3 doses.  Children weighing over 40 kg and adolescents 15 or older receive the adult dosage.  For the calcium salt, the pediatric dosage is 200-300 mg/kg/day, divided, with a maximum of 15 grams per day.

**Crohn's Disease (Adult Remission Maintenance):** The typical oral dosage is 500 mg three times a day.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not consistently defined in manufacturer's labeling.  However, some guidelines suggest reduced doses for individuals with moderate to severe renal impairment.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage adjustments based on individual patient factors.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Agranulocytosis (severe reduction in white blood cells)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Pancytopenia (deficiency of all blood cell types)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
* Thyroid problems (hypothyroidism or goiter)
* Skin rashes (including severe ones like exfoliative dermatitis)
* Eosinophilic pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Encephalopathy (brain dysfunction)
* Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve)


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

### How it Works

PAS is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria. Its mechanism is based on its structural similarity to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a crucial component in bacterial folic acid synthesis. By competitively inhibiting PABA, PAS disrupts the synthesis of folic acid, an essential nutrient for bacterial growth and survival. This ultimately prevents the multiplication of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** PAS is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to PAS or any components of the formulation.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Use caution in patients with liver or kidney problems; it may be contraindicated in severe cases.
* **Gastric Issues:** Use caution in individuals with gastric ulcers or peptic ulcer disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** PAS can interact with various medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), antiplatelets, and hypoglycemics (blood sugar lowering drugs).  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** PAS is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully understood.  It's excreted in breast milk, so use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking PAS.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take PAS with food?** A:  Yes, taking PAS with food can help minimize gastrointestinal side effects.

* **Q: How long does it typically take to see results?** A:  The effectiveness of PAS in treating TB depends on the severity of the infection and the overall treatment regimen.  Results are not immediate and require consistent use over a prolonged period, usually in combination with other TB drugs.

* **Q: How should I store PAS?** A: Storage instructions vary by the formulation. Always follow the instructions on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with PAS?** A: Prolonged use of PAS can increase the risk of certain side effects, such as thyroid problems. Regular monitoring is essential.
