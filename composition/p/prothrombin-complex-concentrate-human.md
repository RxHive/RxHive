# Prothrombin Complex Concentrate Human
### Generic Name
Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (Human)

### Usage
Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is a medication used in adults to urgently reverse acquired deficiencies in coagulation factors caused by vitamin K antagonists like warfarin.  Its primary use is in situations of acute, major bleeding.  This is often a life-threatening situation requiring immediate intervention.  While it's primarily used for reversing warfarin effects, it might be considered in other situations where there's a rapid need to increase coagulation factor levels, but this is less common and necessitates careful consideration by a physician.  It is not typically used for routine warfarin reversal or for minor bleeding episodes.


### Dosage
Dosage of PCC is determined by the patient's pre-treatment INR (International Normalized Ratio), a measure of how long it takes blood to clot.  It's administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage is calculated in units of factor IX per kilogram of body weight.

* **Urgent reversal for surgery/invasive procedure or acute major bleeding:**
    * INR 2 to <4: 25 units of factor IX/kg; maximum dose 2500 units
    * INR 4-6: 35 units of factor IX/kg; maximum dose 3500 units
    * INR >6: 50 units of factor IX/kg; maximum dose 5000 units
    * Vitamin K is typically co-administered to help maintain factor levels long-term.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of PCC in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional taking into account the individual's condition.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Insomnia
* Changes in mental status
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Anemia
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Burning sensation at the injection site
* Arthralgia (joint pain)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain)
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein)
* Thrombosis (blood clot) generally
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Thromboembolic complications (blood clots in arteries or veins)

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
PCC is a mixture of several vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), along with proteins C and S which have antithrombotic properties.  Warfarin works by inhibiting the production of these vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. PCC replenishes these factors, helping to restore normal blood clotting.  The specific factors and their interactions within the coagulation cascade contribute to the overall effect of stopping or reducing bleeding.  The antithrombotic proteins help to balance the pro-coagulation effect, preventing excessive clot formation.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to PCC or any of its components.
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
* Known heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).  PCC contains heparin.
* Non-life-threatening bleeding in patients at high risk of thrombosis.
* Bleeding associated with certain liver conditions.
* IgA deficiency with antibodies against IgA.

**Warnings:**

* **Increased risk of thromboembolic events:** PCC carries a risk of blood clots, particularly in patients with underlying conditions that predispose them to clotting.  The benefits of PCC must be carefully weighed against this risk.
* **Infectious disease transmission:** There's a potential risk of transmitting infectious agents, though the risk is minimized through careful manufacturing processes.
* **Administration:**  Administer cautiously, monitoring pulse rate closely. Avoid blood entering the syringe.

**Interactions:**  The effects of PCC may be increased by antifibrinolytic agents (drugs that prevent clot breakdown).

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** PCC is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for PCC to work?**

A: The effect of PCC is usually seen relatively quickly, typically within minutes to hours, depending on the severity of the deficiency and the individual's response.

**Q: How is PCC stored?**

A:  Storage instructions will be provided with the specific product. Generally, PCC needs to be refrigerated.

**Q: Can PCC be used for all types of bleeding?**

A: No, PCC is indicated for *acute major bleeding* related to vitamin K antagonist deficiency, not minor bleeding or bleeding caused by other conditions.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: PCC is typically given as a single dose in an emergency situation. Missing a dose in this context would need to be addressed with a healthcare professional immediately, assessing the ongoing need for treatment.

**Q: Are there long-term effects associated with PCC use?**

A: Long-term use of PCC is generally not recommended, and potential long-term effects aren't well-established.  This medication is usually used for acute situations.
