# Piperaquine
### Generic Name
Piperaquine

### Usage
Piperaquine is an antimalarial drug primarily used in combination with dihydroartemisinin (usually as Piperaquine/dihydroartemisinin or PA/DHA). This combination is highly effective against *Plasmodium falciparum*, the deadliest species of malaria parasite.  It's used to treat uncomplicated malaria in adults and children, particularly in areas where resistance to other antimalarials is prevalent. While its primary use is treating malaria, it's not typically used alone due to potential for resistance development.  The combination therapy helps prevent or delay the emergence of resistance.

### Dosage

Dosage for Piperaquine/dihydroartemisinin combination therapy varies depending on the specific formulation, the patient's weight, and the severity of the malaria infection.  Always follow the prescription provided by a healthcare professional.  There's no standard, universally accepted dosage for piperaquine alone, as it's almost always administered in combination.  Information below refers to the common PA/DHA combination.

* **Oral:** The dosage is usually determined by weight, with specific guidelines provided on the product label.  It commonly involves taking a fixed combination tablet twice daily for three days. Precise instructions are crucial and vary between products.

* **IV (Intravenous):** Piperaquine is not typically administered intravenously.  Intravenous treatment for severe malaria usually involves other antimalarial drugs.

**Children:**  Dosage adjustments for children are based on weight and are usually provided on the packaging or by the prescribing doctor. It's crucial to follow precise instructions for pediatric administration.

**Important:** Never adjust the dosage or duration of treatment without consulting a doctor.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, fatigue.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality), severe skin reactions, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), changes in blood cell counts.

**Note:** If any side effects occur, especially those listed as serious, seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works

Piperaquine, when combined with dihydroartemisinin, acts synergistically. Dihydroartemisinin rapidly kills the malaria parasites, while piperaquine has a longer half-life, providing sustained suppression of parasite growth and preventing relapse.  Piperaquine achieves this by interfering with the parasite's heme detoxification process, leading to the build-up of toxic heme and ultimately parasite death.  The combined action of the two drugs is essential for its efficacy and to reduce the likelihood of drug resistance.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Piperaquine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Piperaquine may interact with certain medications, particularly those that prolong the QT interval.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of piperaquine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only undertaken under strict medical supervision.  The potential benefits must outweigh the potential risks.
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:**  Patients with liver or kidney problems may require dosage adjustments.
* **Children:**  Careful dosage adjustments are necessary for children based on their weight and age.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of piperaquine and require careful monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Piperaquine alone?** A: No, Piperaquine is almost always used in combination with dihydroartemisinin. Using it alone increases the risk of resistance development.

* **Q: How should I store Piperaquine?** A: Store Piperaquine/dihydroartemisinin at room temperature, protected from light and moisture, as per the directions on the packaging.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses. Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Is Piperaquine safe for long-term use?** A:  Piperaquine/dihydroartemisinin is not intended for long-term use. It's used for a limited period to treat acute malaria infections.

* **Q: Are there any alternatives to Piperaquine/dihydroartemisinin?** A: Yes, several other antimalarial drugs and drug combinations are available. Your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment based on your individual circumstances and the prevalent malaria strains in your area.
