# Phenelzine
### Generic Name
Phenelzine

### Usage
Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) primarily used to treat atypical depression, which is characterized by symptoms like mood reactivity, increased sensitivity to rejection, and leaden paralysis (a feeling of heaviness in the limbs). It's also sometimes used for other types of depression that haven't responded to other treatments.  It's important to note that Phenelzine is generally considered a second- or third-line treatment option for depression, meaning it's typically used only after other antidepressants have proven ineffective.

### Dosage
Dosage for phenelzine varies greatly depending on individual patient response and tolerance.  There is no single universally applicable dose.

**Adults (Depression):** Treatment typically begins with a low dose, gradually increasing until an effective dose is reached or maximum tolerance is achieved.  A common starting point is 15 mg three times a day (TID). The dose can be increased, under the close supervision of a physician, to a range of 60-90 mg per day.  It's crucial to remember that it might take several weeks, even up to 4 weeks at a 60mg daily dose, to see a clinical response. Once the optimal dose is determined, it's gradually reduced over several weeks to find the lowest effective maintenance dose. This might be as low as 15 mg daily or even 15mg every other day.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of phenelzine in children have not been established.  It's not prescribed for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Phenelzine is contraindicated in patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Mild to moderate renal impairment may not require dose adjustments, but severe impairment is a contraindication.  Always consult a physician for guidance in cases of renal disease.
* **Switching from other medications:** There are specific time intervals required when switching between phenelzine and other antidepressants or MAOIs.  Consult a healthcare professional for detailed instructions regarding these washout periods, which vary depending on the specific medication.

### Side Effects
Phenelzine, like other medications, can cause various side effects.  Some are common, while others are more serious but less frequent.

**Common Side Effects:**
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Insomnia or hypersomnia (excessive sleeping)
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Nausea
* Anxiety (particularly during the initial phase of treatment)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**
* Liver damage (hepatitis) – monitor liver function regularly
* Hypertensive crisis (a sudden, dangerous increase in blood pressure) –  requires immediate medical attention
* Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition) – requires immediate medical attention

**Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Phenelzine works by inhibiting monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain.  By inhibiting MAO, phenelzine increases the levels of these neurotransmitters, which helps improve mood and alleviate symptoms of depression.

### Precautions
* **Tyramine-Rich Foods:**  A strict diet low in tyramine is essential during treatment and for a couple of weeks after stopping phenelzine.  Tyramine can interact dangerously with phenelzine, leading to a hypertensive crisis.  Foods to avoid include aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented products, and some alcoholic beverages.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Phenelzine interacts strongly with many other medications, including other antidepressants, certain pain relievers, and decongestants.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Phenelzine is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning the potential benefits must outweigh the risks.  It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk. Consult your healthcare provider before taking phenelzine if you're pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy.
* **Other Precautions:**  Phenelzine should be used with caution in patients with certain conditions like heart problems, high blood pressure, liver or kidney disease, or those with a history of seizures.
