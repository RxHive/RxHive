# Polyvinyl Alcohol
### Generic Name
Polyvinyl Alcohol

### Usage

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is not a drug in the traditional sense; it's a polymer used as an excipient in various ophthalmic preparations.  Its primary function is to increase the viscosity of eye drops and solutions. This increased viscosity prolongs the contact time of the active ingredients (if any) with the surface of the eye, leading to improved effectiveness and longer-lasting relief.  Therefore, you won't find PVA as a standalone medication.  Instead, it's a component found in products designed to treat:

* **Dry Eye Syndrome:** PVA helps lubricate and moisten the eyes, providing relief from dryness, irritation, and discomfort associated with this condition. It's often included in artificial tears formulations.
* **Contact Lens Discomfort:**  PVA is used in some contact lens solutions to enhance lubrication and comfort, especially for those who experience dryness or irritation while wearing lenses.


### Dosage

There's no specific dosage of PVA itself, as it's not administered independently. The concentration of PVA in ophthalmic solutions varies depending on the formulation and the intended use. Common concentrations in artificial tears range from approximately 1.4% to 3%.  Dosage instructions are always provided on the specific product label and should be carefully followed.  These instructions will typically include the number of drops to instill and the frequency of application.


### Side Effects

PVA is generally well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects, such as:

* Transient burning or stinging sensation upon application.
* Mild redness or irritation.

Serious side effects are rare. If you experience any unusual or persistent reactions after using a product containing PVA, discontinue use and contact a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Polyvinyl alcohol is a hydrophilic polymer, meaning it readily attracts and binds water molecules.  When incorporated into eye drops or solutions, it increases the viscosity (thickness) of the liquid.  This thicker consistency allows the formulation to remain longer on the surface of the eye, providing sustained lubrication and moisture.  It acts as a lubricating agent, effectively coating the eye's surface and reducing friction, thereby alleviating dryness and discomfort.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** While rare, some individuals may be allergic to PVA. If you experience an allergic reaction (such as severe itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing), seek immediate medical attention.
* **Contact Lens Compatibility:**  Always check the compatibility of the PVA-containing product with your specific type of contact lenses.
* **Contamination:**  Avoid touching the tip of the dropper to any surface to prevent contamination.
* **Storage:** Store the product according to the instructions on the label.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use a PVA-containing product if I have other eye conditions?**  A: Always consult your ophthalmologist or optometrist before using any eye drops, particularly if you have pre-existing eye conditions such as glaucoma, infections, or corneal abrasions.

* **Q: How long can I store an opened bottle of artificial tears containing PVA?** A:  Refer to the expiration date and storage instructions printed on the product packaging.  Opened bottles typically have a shorter shelf life than unopened ones.

* **Q: Is PVA safe for children?** A: Generally, PVA is considered safe for use in children's ophthalmic preparations, but always follow the dosage and usage instructions provided by the manufacturer and consult a pediatrician if you have any concerns.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get too much PVA-containing eye drops in my eye?** A:  Rinse your eye with clean water and consult your doctor if irritation persists.
