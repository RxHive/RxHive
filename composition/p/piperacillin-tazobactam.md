# Piperacillin + Tazobactam
### Generic Name
Piperacillin and Tazobactam

### Usage

Piperacillin and tazobactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat several serious bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating infections that are difficult to manage with other antibiotics, often because the bacteria producing the infection are resistant to many other drugs.  The specific infections it's used for include:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** These are infections within the abdomen, such as those following surgery or from conditions like appendicitis, peritonitis, or diverticulitis.
* **Nosocomial pneumonia:** Pneumonia acquired during a hospital stay.
* **Community-acquired pneumonia:** Pneumonia acquired outside of a hospital setting.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:**  This includes infections like cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections, particularly those that are severe or don't respond to other treatments.  It's especially useful against infections caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a bacterium often resistant to other antibiotics.
* **Pelvic infections in females:** Infections of the female reproductive organs.

It is important to note that piperacillin/tazobactam is a broad-spectrum antibiotic;  it is effective against a wide range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria.  However, its use should always be guided by culture and sensitivity testing to ensure it's the appropriate treatment for the specific infection.


### Dosage

Dosage of piperacillin/tazobactam varies significantly depending on the infection's severity, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  The drug is typically given intravenously (IV).  There are several different dosing regimens that may be used, and it's crucial that a healthcare professional determines the appropriate dosage. Below are examples;  **never attempt to self-dose or adjust the dose without direct medical supervision.**

**Adults:**  Dosages typically range from 3.375 g to 4.5 g every 6-8 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 18 g.  The specific dose and frequency will be determined by the healthcare provider.  Different infusion methods (standard 30-minute infusion, extended 4-hour infusion, or continuous 24-hour infusion) are used depending on the situation.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosing is calculated based on weight in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dose and frequency.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include diarrhea.

Less common but potentially serious side effects can include:

* Headache
* Insomnia
* Rigors (shaking chills)
* Flushing
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
*  Infections (such as *Clostridioides difficile* colitis, a potentially serious intestinal infection)
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Piperacillin is a penicillin-class antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall.  Bacteria need a strong cell wall to survive, and by disrupting its formation, piperacillin leads to the bacterial cell's death.  Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that can break down penicillin-class antibiotics, rendering them ineffective.  Tazobactam prevents this breakdown, allowing piperacillin to work more effectively against bacteria that produce these enzymes.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Piperacillin and tazobactam should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics.  Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.
* **Kidney function:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.
* **Liver function:**  While dosage adjustments aren't typically required for liver problems, liver function should be monitored.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The drug should be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding only if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Discuss this with your doctor.
* **Drug interactions:**  Piperacillin and tazobactam can interact with other medications, including some antibiotics and anticoagulants.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Superinfections:**  As with other antibiotics, long-term use can lead to the overgrowth of other microorganisms, potentially causing superinfections.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?**  A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection's type and severity and will be determined by your doctor.  Treatment may range from a few days to several weeks.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking piperacillin and tazobactam?** A: Alcohol is not explicitly contraindicated but it's advisable to discuss alcohol consumption with your physician.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on missed doses.  Don't double up on doses without consulting them.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist or doctor. Typically, it requires refrigeration.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and hives.
