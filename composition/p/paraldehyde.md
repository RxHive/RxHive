# Paraldehyde
### Generic Name
Paraldehyde

### Usage
Paraldehyde is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant with sedative and anticonvulsant properties.  Its primary use is as a last-resort treatment for convulsive seizures associated with conditions like status epilepticus, tetanus, and convulsant drug toxicity.  This means it's only used when other, more standard treatments are ineffective, inappropriate, or unavailable due to its potential for serious side effects and the availability of safer alternatives. Historically, paraldehyde was also used as a sedative-hypnotic, anxiolytic (to reduce anxiety), and for managing alcohol withdrawal delirium or acute agitation. However, these uses are now largely discouraged because safer and more effective medications exist.

### Dosage
Paraldehyde dosage varies greatly depending on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular [IM], intravenous [IV], or rectal), the patient's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  Precise dosage should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional.  The information below is for general knowledge only and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults:**

* **Sedation (Oral):** 4-8 mL of a 1 g/mL solution.
* **Status Epilepticus (IM):** 5-10 mL of a 10% solution (with normal saline or oil as a vehicle), with a maximum of 5 mL injected at any one site. The maximum daily dose is 20 mL.
* **Status Epilepticus (IV):** 0.1-0.3 mL/kg of a 4-5% solution (with normal saline as a vehicle).
* **Status Epilepticus (Rectal):** 10-20 mL of a 10% solution (with normal saline or oil as a vehicle).  A 2:1 mixture of paraldehyde and cottonseed or olive oil is often used.
* **Alcohol Withdrawal (IM):**  Initial dose of 5 mL every 4-6 hours for 24 hours (maximum 30 mL on day 1), then every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose is 20 mL.
* **Hypnotic (IM):** 10 mL; never exceed 5 mL per injection site.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and are weight-based.  They must be calculated and administered by a healthcare professional.  Dosages vary based on age and the specific condition being treated. For example, IM or rectal administration for status epilepticus involves doses ranging from 0.5 mL (for children under 3 months) to 5-6 mL (for children aged 6-12 years) of a 10% solution.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly defined in manufacturer labeling but require caution, potentially including dose reductions in patients with mild-to-moderate liver impairment. Paraldehyde is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Halitosis (bad breath)
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Skin rash
* Muscle cramps
* Tremor

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Toxic hepatitis (liver damage)
* Nephrosis (kidney damage)
* Metabolic acidosis (build-up of acid in the body)
* Injection site reactions (pain, inflammation, tissue damage, sterile abscesses, nerve damage)
* Drug dependence (with prolonged use)

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action for paraldehyde is not fully understood. However, it's known to depress the CNS, including the reticular activating system, which is responsible for arousal and wakefulness. This leads to its sedative and hypnotic effects.  It also possesses anticonvulsant properties, likely through a different mechanism. Importantly, it lacks analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at sub-anesthetic doses.  In the presence of pain, it can even cause agitation or delirium.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to paraldehyde, severe hepatic insufficiency, bronchopulmonary disease, and pregnancy.
* **Interactions:** Paraldehyde can interact with other CNS depressants (e.g., barbiturates, alcohol, opioids) and disulfiram, increasing the risk of respiratory depression and toxicity. Concomitant use should be avoided.
* **Warnings:**  Paraldehyde use carries a risk of toxic hepatitis, nephrosis, CNS depression, and metabolic acidosis. Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, or a history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism. Pregnancy must be excluded before initiating treatment in women of childbearing potential.  Paraldehyde crosses the placenta and is contraindicated in pregnancy.  The effect on breastfeeding is unknown, and breastfeeding is not recommended.  Abrupt withdrawal after prolonged use can be dangerous.
* **Administration:** Intramuscular injections are painful and can cause serious injection site reactions; avoid injecting near nerve trunks.  Never administer intravenously.  Use only glass syringes; avoid contact with plastic or rubber. Do not use if the solution is discolored or smells of acetic acid.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take paraldehyde with other medications?** A: No, paraldehyde interacts negatively with many medications, particularly other CNS depressants.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining it with other drugs.
* **Q: How should I store paraldehyde?** A: Store it as directed by your healthcare provider, usually in a cool, dark place, away from heat, flames, and sparks.
* **Q: Is paraldehyde safe for pregnant women?** A: No, it is contraindicated in pregnancy.
* **Q: Can I take paraldehyde if I have liver or kidney problems?** A: Use with extreme caution in patients with mild-to-moderate liver impairment; it's contraindicated in severe cases.  Renal impairment does not have specific dosage adjustments.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not try to double up on doses.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration. Consult with your prescribing healthcare professional.
* **Q: Can I become addicted to paraldehyde?** A: Yes, prolonged use can lead to physical and psychological dependence.
