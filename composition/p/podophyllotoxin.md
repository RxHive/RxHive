# Podophyllotoxin
### Generic Name
Podophyllotoxin

### Usage

Podophyllotoxin is primarily used topically to treat genital warts and perianal warts.  It's also sometimes used off-label for molluscum contagiosum, a common skin infection.  The medication works by directly attacking the affected skin cells, causing them to die and eventually slough off. It's important to note that podophyllotoxin is not a cure for these conditions; its effectiveness varies, and it may need to be used in combination with other treatments.  It is crucial to follow a healthcare professional's guidance.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Genital Warts:**  For topical solutions (0.5%), apply twice daily (morning and evening) for three consecutive days, followed by a four-day break. This cycle can be repeated up to four times, depending on response.  The maximum daily dose is 0.5 mL or application to no more than 10 cm² of wart tissue.
* **Perianal Warts:** The dosage is the same as for genital warts, using either a 0.5% solution or gel. The maximum daily dose is 0.5 g or application to no more than 10 cm² of wart tissue.
* **Molluscum Contagiosum (Off-label):**  Apply a 0.5% solution or gel twice daily (morning and evening) for three consecutive days, followed by a four-day break.  This cycle may be repeated up to four times, or until the lesion resolves.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of podophyllotoxin in children have not been established. It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, it's always crucial to consult a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Localized burning or pain
* Skin erosion
* Local inflammation and itching
* Local hemorrhage (bleeding)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects may include:

* Headache
* Skin stinging or redness
* Crusting, ulceration, skin peeling, edema (swelling), blistering, discoloration, cracking, rash, tenderness, tingling, or dryness

If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works

Podophyllotoxin is a cytotoxic agent, meaning it kills cells. It works by interfering with the microtubules within cells, which are essential for cell division.  By disrupting this process, podophyllotoxin prevents the growth and replication of the cells causing warts or molluscum contagiosum. This leads to the eventual destruction of the affected tissue and eventual clearance of the infection.  The drug acts topically, meaning it primarily affects the cells at the application site.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Podophyllotoxin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, people with diabetes, those on corticosteroid therapy, and individuals with poor circulation.
* **Interactions:** The potential interactions with other drugs are not fully understood; it is important to inform a healthcare professional about all other medications being used.
* **Warnings:** Avoid contact with healthy skin.  Do not use on inflamed, irritated, bleeding warts, moles, birthmarks, or warts with hair growth.  For genital warts, carefully follow instructions to avoid contact with the mucous membranes of the vagina, urethra, and rectum. Use caution in patients with pre-existing skin conditions.
