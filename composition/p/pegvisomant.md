# Pegvisomant
### Generic Name
Pegvisomant

### Usage

Pegvisomant is a medication used to treat acromegaly in adults.  Acromegaly is a rare disorder characterized by the overproduction of growth hormone (GH), leading to excessive growth of bones, tissues, and organs.  Pegvisomant is typically prescribed for individuals who haven't responded adequately to surgery or radiation therapy, or for whom these treatments aren't suitable. Its primary function is to block the effects of growth hormone, thereby controlling the symptoms of acromegaly.


### Dosage

**Acromegaly (Adults):** Pegvisomant is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  The initial dose is a 40 mg loading dose.  This is followed by a daily maintenance dose, typically starting at 10 mg.  The dosage can be adjusted, in 5 mg increments or decrements, every 4-6 weeks based on Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) levels.  The maintenance dose generally ranges from 10 to 30 mg per day, with a maximum recommended dose of 30 mg per day. Dosage adjustments are *not* based on growth hormone levels or symptoms.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of pegvisomant in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) impairment. Patients with normal liver function tests (LFTs) at the start of treatment should have their LFTs monitored regularly, while those with elevated LFTs may require closer monitoring and potential dosage adjustments or discontinuation.  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for individuals with renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Pain
* Flu-like symptoms
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abnormal liver function test results
* Antibody development
* Infection
* Injection site reactions

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Chest pain
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Lipohypertrophy (abnormal fat accumulation at injection sites)
* Back pain
* Sinusitis
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, etc.)
* Tumor growth (in rare cases)

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Pegvisomant is a growth hormone receptor antagonist.  This means it works by binding to the growth hormone receptors on cells, preventing growth hormone from attaching and exerting its effects.  By blocking the growth hormone's action, pegvisomant helps lower the levels of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), a hormone whose overproduction is a key feature of acromegaly.  Lowering IGF-1 levels helps to alleviate the symptoms and complications of the condition.


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Pegvisomant is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Liver Function:** Pegvisomant can affect liver function, and close monitoring of liver enzymes is crucial.  Treatment may need to be adjusted or stopped if liver problems develop.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Pegvisomant is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been fully established. It's generally not recommended during pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the risks.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pegvisomant can interact with other medications, such as analgesics (opioids), blood glucose-lowering agents, pegloticase, and somatostatin analogs. Discuss all medications you are taking with your healthcare provider.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Injection Site:** Rotate injection sites daily to minimize lipohypertrophy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Pegvisomant?** A: The time to see improvement in symptoms can vary, but often, reductions in IGF-1 levels and clinical improvements are observed within weeks to months of starting treatment.

* **Q: How is Pegvisomant stored?** A:  Store Pegvisomant in the refrigerator.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Pegvisomant suddenly?** A:  No, stop taking Pegvisomant only under your doctor's guidance.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to a rebound in growth hormone levels.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Is Pegvisomant suitable for everyone with acromegaly?** A: No, it is primarily used for those who haven't responded well to surgery or radiation or for whom those treatments are inappropriate.  Your doctor will determine if it's the right treatment for you.

* **Q: Are there long-term risks associated with Pegvisomant?** A: Long-term use can be associated with an increased risk of liver problems and the development of antibodies to the medication. Regular monitoring by your doctor is crucial.
