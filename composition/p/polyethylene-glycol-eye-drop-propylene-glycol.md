# Polyethylene Glycol Eye Drop + Propylene Glycol
### Generic Name
Polyethylene Glycol Eye Drop + Propylene Glycol


### Usage

This combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and propylene glycol (PG) in eye drop form is primarily used as a lubricant and moisturizer for the eyes.  It's commonly employed to relieve the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, including burning, stinging, irritation, and a gritty sensation.  While not a treatment for the underlying cause of dry eye, it provides symptomatic relief by supplementing the natural tear film and improving lubrication.  It might also be used as a vehicle for other ophthalmic medications, although this is less common for this specific PEG/PG combination.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation and the recommendation of the prescribing ophthalmologist or healthcare professional.  There is no standardized dosage across all brands or presentations.  Generally, one or two drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) as needed, several times a day.  

* **Adults:** The frequency of application depends on individual needs and symptom severity.  Some individuals may only need it a few times a day, while others may use it more frequently.  
* **Children:** Use in children should only be under the direct supervision and guidance of a pediatrician or ophthalmologist.  The dosage will be tailored to the child's age and condition.
* **Oral and IV Administration:** This combination is **not** intended for oral or intravenous administration. It is strictly for topical ophthalmic use only.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and temporary and may include:

* Transient burning or stinging sensation upon application
* Mild blurring of vision immediately after application (usually resolves quickly)
* Eye redness or irritation

Less common, but more serious side effects are rare but should be reported to your doctor immediately:

* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Persistent eye pain or redness
* Increased eye irritation or discomfort


If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol are both humectants, meaning they attract and retain moisture. When applied to the eye, they help to increase the viscosity and stability of the tear film, improving lubrication and reducing the dryness and irritation associated with dry eye.  They essentially act as artificial tears, supplementing the body's natural tear production.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to polyethylene glycol or propylene glycol should avoid using this medication.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying the eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are currently taking, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and herbal supplements, to check for potential interactions.  While rare with this specific combination, interactions are possible.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered low-risk, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this medication.
* **Children:**  Use in children should only be under the direction of a pediatrician or ophthalmologist.
