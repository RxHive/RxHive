# Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

### Usage

This combination medication is a common over-the-counter (OTC) treatment for the symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory infections.  It addresses multiple symptoms simultaneously:

* **Pseudoephedrine:** A decongestant, it shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and congestion.  This helps improve airflow and makes breathing easier.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, it works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens or irritants. This helps to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or colds.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** An antitussive (cough suppressant), it reduces the urge to cough by affecting the cough center in the brain. This is particularly helpful for a dry, unproductive cough.

This combination is primarily used for symptomatic relief of cold and flu symptoms. It doesn't treat the underlying infection itself but helps manage the unpleasant symptoms making the individual feel more comfortable.  It's important to note that this is not appropriate for a cough producing phlegm (productive cough) as suppressing that cough can be detrimental.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation and the age of the patient.  Always follow the instructions printed on the product label carefully.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**  If you have any questions, consult your doctor or pharmacist.  This information is for general guidance only and does not substitute professional medical advice.  Precise dosages for children are usually specified on the product labeling by weight or age range and should be followed exactly.  Oral administration is typical for this combination medication.  There is no IV form of this particular combination.

* Drowsiness

### How it Works

As detailed above, this medication is a combination of three active ingredients, each working through a different mechanism:

* **Pseudoephedrine:** Acts as a sympathomimetic amine, stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal blood vessels causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This reduces swelling and congestion.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks histamine receptors (H1 receptors) preventing histamine from binding and triggering the inflammatory response that causes symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts centrally on the cough center in the brain, suppressing the cough reflex.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
