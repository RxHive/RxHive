# Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, or other respiratory illnesses.  The specific symptoms it addresses are:

* **Pseudoephedrine:** A decongestant that relieves stuffy nose and nasal congestion by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes caused by allergies or the common cold.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.

This medication is typically used for short-term relief of symptoms and should not be taken for extended periods without consulting a doctor.  It's crucial to follow the dosage instructions carefully.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is particularly associated with chlorpheniramine maleate.  Do not drive or operate machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:**  This is common with both antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Headache**
* **Nausea**
* **Dizziness**
* **Insomnia (difficulty sleeping):** Particularly with pseudoephedrine, especially if taken later in the day.
* **Constipation**
* **Increased heart rate** (more likely with pseudoephedrine)
* **Increased blood pressure** (more likely with pseudoephedrine)
* **Urinary retention** (difficulty urinating)


**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention. These include:**  allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), fast or irregular heartbeat, seizures, and hallucinations.


**How it Works:**

* **Pseudoephedrine:**  This sympathomimetic amine acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This reduces swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This first-generation antihistamine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction or cold.  This reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This acts centrally in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
