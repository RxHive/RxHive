# Protein C
### Generic Name
Protein C

### Usage

Protein C is primarily used to treat Protein C deficiency. This deficiency can lead to an increased risk of blood clots (thrombosis) and a severe condition called purpura fulminans, characterized by widespread blood clotting in small blood vessels, often affecting the skin.  Protein C is also indicated in the treatment of Warfarin-induced skin necrosis, a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Intravenous):**

* **Acute episode or short-term prophylaxis:** The initial dose is typically 100-120 IU/kg intravenously. This is followed by 60-80 IU/kg intravenously every 6 hours for three doses.  Subsequently, the dose is adjusted to 45-60 IU/kg intravenously twice daily or four times daily, depending on the patient's response and clinical condition.
* **Long-term prophylaxis:** The usual dose is 45-60 IU/kg intravenously every 12 hours.

**Pediatric Dosage (Intravenous):**

The dosage for children with Protein C deficiency is similar to that of adults, but it's crucial to note that the exact dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's weight and clinical condition.

* **Acute episode or short-term prophylaxis:** The initial dose is typically 100-120 IU/kg intravenously. This is followed by 60-80 IU/kg intravenously every 6 hours for three doses.  Subsequently, the dose is adjusted to 45-60 IU/kg intravenously twice daily or four times daily, depending on the child's response and clinical condition.
* **Long-term prophylaxis:** The usual dose is 45-60 IU/kg intravenously every 12 hours.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Close monitoring is necessary in patients with kidney problems to watch for signs of sodium overload.  Patients with liver problems will also require close monitoring.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), lightheadedness, itching, and rash.
* **Less Common, but Serious:** Hemothorax (bleeding into the chest cavity), hypotension (low blood pressure), hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), fever, restlessness, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (a decrease in platelets due to heparin).

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Protein C is converted in the body to activated protein C (APC). APC is a natural anticoagulant (blood thinner) that works by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa.  These factors are crucial for blood clot formation. By inactivating them, APC helps prevent excessive clot formation.  Furthermore, research suggests APC also has anti-inflammatory effects and may promote the breakdown of existing clots.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Protein C is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Protein C can interact with various medications, especially those affecting blood clotting (anticoagulants, antiplatelets).  There is a significant potential for increased bleeding risk if Protein C is used with other drugs affecting coagulation.  Healthcare providers must carefully assess the potential for interactions and adjust therapy accordingly.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Protein C is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully established. Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  It's unknown whether Protein C is secreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring for signs of bleeding is crucial during Protein C therapy. Regular blood tests are needed to monitor protein C levels and other coagulation parameters.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Protein C administered?**
    * **A:** Protein C is administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How long does it take to see the effects of Protein C?**
    * **A:** The onset of action varies depending on the individual and the specific indication. It's crucial to follow the prescribed treatment regimen and consult with your healthcare provider for any concerns.

* **Q: How is Protein C stored?**
    * **A:** Storage instructions should be followed precisely as per the product label provided by the manufacturer.

* **Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with Protein C therapy?**
    * **A:** Long-term risks are relatively infrequent, but close monitoring of blood counts and coagulation parameters is crucial to detect and manage potential issues.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while receiving Protein C?**
    * **A:** It's vital to disclose all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to your healthcare provider before starting Protein C therapy, as it can interact with numerous medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of Protein C?**
    * **A:** Do not attempt to adjust or skip doses on your own.  Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss the missed dose and follow their instructions for resuming therapy.
