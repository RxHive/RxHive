# Primidone
### Generic Name
Primidone

### Usage
Primidone is primarily used as an anticonvulsant medication to control various types of seizures, including grand mal (tonic-clonic), psychomotor (temporal lobe), and focal seizures.  It's often used either alone or in combination with other anti-seizure medications.  In some cases, it may be used to manage seizures that haven't responded well to other treatments.  While not its primary use, primidone is sometimes used off-label to treat essential tremor.


### Dosage

**Seizures (Grand mal, focal, psychomotor):**

* **Adults:** Dosage is highly individualized and requires careful titration under a doctor's supervision.  A typical starting dose is 100-125 mg once daily at bedtime.  This may be gradually increased over several days or weeks to a maintenance dose, usually 250 mg three times daily (TID), but can range up to 2000 mg/day depending on individual response and tolerance. If already taking other anticonvulsants, a lower starting dose is used and adjusted as other medications are reduced.  Complete conversion to primidone monotherapy should take at least 2 weeks.
* **Children (under 8 years):** Starting dose is usually lower, often 50 mg once daily at bedtime, gradually increased to a maintenance dose of 125-250 mg TID, or 10-25 mg/kg/day in divided doses. The specific dosage is carefully determined by a doctor based on the childâ€™s weight and response.  
* **Children (8 years and older):**  Dosage is generally similar to that of adults.

**Essential Tremor (Off-label):**

* **Adults:** The starting dose is typically 50-62.5 mg once daily, gradually increased by 62.5-125 mg every 1-3 days, or 250 mg weekly,  up to a maximum of 750 mg daily.  The daily dose is usually split into 2-3 doses.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  In such cases,  the doctor will monitor blood levels and adjust the dose accordingly.  Hemodialysis patients require special considerations; typically, the dose is administered after dialysis, or a supplemental dose may be given before.

**Administration:** Primidone is usually taken orally as tablets.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia (lack of coordination), fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and emotional disturbances.
* **Less Common, but Serious:** Megaloblastic anemia, agranulocytosis, pure red cell aplasia, and suicidal ideation.  Skin rashes can also occur.
* **Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.



### How it Works

Primidone itself is not fully active.  In the body, it is converted into two active metabolites: phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA).  These metabolites work to decrease the excitability of neurons in the brain, thereby raising the seizure threshold and reducing the likelihood of seizures.  PEMA may also enhance the effects of phenobarbital.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Primidone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to phenobarbital or porphyria.
* **Interactions:** Primidone can interact with many other medications, including other anticonvulsants, CYP3A4 substrates and inducers (affecting metabolism), and potentially affecting blood levels of other drugs. Consult a healthcare professional about any other medications you are currently taking.
* **Warnings:**  Primidone may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in patients with a history of depression or suicidal ideation.  It can cause drowsiness and impair coordination, so avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.  It's crucial to avoid alcohol and other central nervous system depressants.  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, respiratory problems, or a history of substance abuse.   Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before taking primidone, as it can cross the placenta and be found in breast milk.  Prophylactic vitamin K is often recommended during pregnancy.
* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of primidone and require closer monitoring.
* **Children:** Children may require more frequent monitoring for side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Primidone suddenly?**  A: No, never stop taking primidone suddenly.  Abrupt withdrawal can lead to serious complications, including increased seizure frequency and severity.  The dosage must be gradually reduced under the supervision of a doctor.

* **Q: How should I store Primidone?** A: Store Primidone at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Primidone?** A: No, avoid alcohol while taking primidone.  Alcohol can significantly increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.
