# Pheniramine
### Generic Name
Pheniramine

### Usage

Pheniramine is a first-generation antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies and certain respiratory conditions.  Its primary use targets the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions.  This leads to its effectiveness in treating allergic rhinitis (hay fever), allergic conjunctivitis (allergic eye inflammation), urticaria (hives), and other skin conditions characterized by itching and inflammation.  Secondary uses include managing symptoms of the common cold (though it doesn't treat the underlying infection), motion sickness, and nausea and vomiting.  It's important to note that pheniramine treats symptoms, not the underlying cause of the condition.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated, the formulation (tablet, syrup, injection), and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow a healthcare professional's specific instructions.  Here's a general overview:

**Adults:**

* **Oral (Allergic Conditions/Skin Conditions):** Extended-release tablets: 75 mg at bedtime (higher doses may be temporarily used in severe cases). Immediate-release tablets:  Initially, 22.65 mg (half a tablet) up to three times daily as needed; may be increased to 45.3 mg (one tablet) up to three times daily. Syrup: 15-30 mg, two to three times daily. Maximum daily dose is generally 3mg/kg/day.
* **Oral (Respiratory Conditions/Motion Sickness/Nausea & Vomiting):** Immediate-release tablets:  Initially 22.65 mg (half a tablet) up to three times daily as needed; may be increased to 45.3 mg (one tablet) up to three times daily.
* **Intramuscular/Intravenous (Allergic/Respiratory Conditions/Motion Sickness/Nausea & Vomiting):** 1-2 mL (22.75 mg/mL) twice daily by intramuscular or slow intravenous injection (from ampoules). Multidose vials are not recommended for IV use.

**Children:** Dosages for children are significantly lower and highly dependent on age and weight.  Precise instructions must be obtained from a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare provider.  Generally, children's doses are calculated based on body weight (mg/kg/day), with a maximum often around 3 mg/kg/day.  Syrups are commonly used for younger children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly stated in standard prescribing information; consult with a healthcare provider.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild but can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Headache
* Irritability
* Difficulty concentrating

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Urinary retention
* Increased intraocular pressure
* Agranulocytosis (severe decrease in white blood cells)
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)

If you experience any concerning side effects, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Pheniramine is a competitive H1 histamine receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a chemical that triggers the body's allergic response, causing inflammation, itching, and other symptoms.  By blocking histamine from binding to its receptors, pheniramine prevents or reduces these symptoms.  This mechanism is responsible for its effectiveness in treating allergic reactions.  Additionally, pheniramine possesses some anticholinergic properties, which contribute to its effects on things like dry mouth and constipation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pheniramine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to pheniramine or any component of the formulation,  those with symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, those concurrently using MAO inhibitors, and newborn or premature infants.
* **Interactions:**  Pheniramine can interact with numerous other medications, including those affecting the central nervous system (CNS depressants, alcohol).  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Pheniramine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy has not been fully established. Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be under close medical supervision.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy, narrow-angle glaucoma, asthma, or severe cardiovascular disease, as well as in those with diabetes (due to sugar content in syrup formulations).  Avoid activities requiring alertness (like driving or operating machinery) until drowsiness subsides.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take pheniramine with alcohol?** A: Combining pheniramine with alcohol is strongly discouraged. Both can cause drowsiness and CNS depression; combining them increases the risk significantly.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies by formulation but is generally relatively quick for immediate-release forms.
* **Q: How should I store pheniramine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.
* **Q: Is pheniramine habit-forming?** A: No, pheniramine is not considered a habit-forming medication.
* **Q: Can I take pheniramine long-term?** A: Long-term use should be discussed with a doctor.  It is generally not recommended for extended periods without medical supervision.
