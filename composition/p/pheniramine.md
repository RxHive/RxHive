# Pheniramine

**Generic Name:** Pheniramine Maleate

**Usage:**

Pheniramine maleate is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever, and other upper respiratory allergies.  These symptoms include:

* Runny nose
* Sneezing
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Itching of the nose and throat

It's also sometimes found in combination with other medications, such as decongestants or analgesics, in over-the-counter cold and allergy medications.  Prescription formulations exist but are less common.


**Side Effects:**

Pheniramine maleate, like other antihistamines, can cause a variety of side effects, though not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Headache
* Nervousness or irritability (paradoxical effects, especially in children)
* Difficulty urinating

Less common but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast heartbeat
* Seizures
* Hallucinations


**How it Works:**

Pheniramine maleate is a first-generation antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens. Histamine causes many of the symptoms associated with allergies. By blocking histamine's effects, pheniramine maleate helps to relieve these symptoms.
