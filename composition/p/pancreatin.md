# Pancreatin
### Generic Name
Pancreatin

### Usage
Pancreatin is a medication containing enzymes naturally produced by the pancreas.  Its primary use is to treat exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). This condition occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough digestive enzymes, leading to malabsorption of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.  This can result from various conditions like cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, or after pancreatic surgery.  Pancreatin helps to supplement the body's deficient enzyme production, improving digestion and nutrient absorption.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  For exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, the typical adult dose is 1000 mg (usually one tablet) with each meal, and an additional 1000 mg (two tablets) with snacks eaten between meals.  The exact dosage will be determined by a healthcare provider based on individual needs and response to treatment.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of pancreatin in children have not been established.  Dosage in children should only be determined and overseen by a pediatrician or pediatric gastroenterologist.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution should be exercised when using pancreatin in patients with kidney problems.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Perianal pain
* Rash
* Abdominal discomfort
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Oral cavity irritation
* Lacrimation (watering eyes)
* Sneezing
* Increased uric acid levels (less common)

Less frequent but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare professional if any adverse effects develop.


### How it Works
Pancreatin contains amylase (breaks down carbohydrates), lipase (breaks down fats), and protease (breaks down proteins).  These enzymes are crucial for proper digestion. When the pancreas doesn't produce sufficient quantities of these enzymes, undigested food passes through the digestive system, leading to malnutrition and other symptoms. Pancreatin supplements these missing enzymes, allowing for more efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Pancreatin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to pancreatin, pork proteins (as it's often derived from pork), or any other components of the medication.
* **Interactions:**  While not extensively documented, potential interactions with other medications could exist.  It's essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Pancreatin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and guidance from a healthcare professional.
* **General Precautions:** Tablets are not enteric-coated and should ideally be taken with a proton-pump inhibitor. Capsules should be swallowed whole with plenty of liquid, or their contents can be sprinkled onto soft, acidic food (pH <4.5). Patients with cystic fibrosis may require additional vitamin supplementation, as advised by their doctor.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew pancreatin tablets?** A: No, it's generally recommended to swallow pancreatin tablets or capsules whole with a generous amount of liquid to avoid enzyme inactivation by stomach acid.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store pancreatin?** A: Store pancreatin as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I stop taking pancreatin suddenly?** A: No. Always consult your doctor before stopping any medication, including pancreatin. Sudden cessation might worsen symptoms.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with pancreatin use?** A:  Long-term effects are generally uncommon with proper use and monitoring.  However, consistent monitoring by a healthcare professional is important, especially for conditions like cystic fibrosis.
