# Pipamperone
### Generic Name
Pipamperone

### Usage
Pipamperone is a typical antipsychotic medication primarily used to manage chronic psychoses and aggressive behaviors stemming from various causes.  It's effective in reducing symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking associated with psychotic disorders.  It's also sometimes used to treat aggressive behaviors, but its use in this context requires careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.  It's important to note that pipamperone is not indicated for behavioral disorders related to dementia.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosages are expressed in terms of the pipamperone base. Pipamperone hydrochloride 47.8 mg is equivalent to approximately 40 mg of pipamperone.  For psychoses, the typical oral dosage (tablet or solution) is 40 mg twice or thrice daily.  Higher daily doses (up to 360 mg) may be used in divided doses, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision. Geriatric patients usually start with lower doses (20-40 mg three times daily), carefully titrated upwards as needed. Blood pressure monitoring is essential during treatment.

**Children (under 14 years):**  For psychoses, the oral solution is typically initiated at 1 mg/kg/day and adjusted incrementally (by 1 mg/kg/day) until the desired effect is achieved. A daily dose of 2-6 mg/kg is generally sufficient, divided into three administrations.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. Therefore, caution is advised in patients with liver or kidney problems.  A healthcare professional should carefully monitor patients with impaired organ function.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hypersalivation, drowsiness, insomnia, headache, dizziness
* **Less Common but Serious:** Extrapyramidal symptoms (muscle rigidity, tremors, involuntary movements), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle stiffness, altered mental status), tardive dyskinesia (a late-onset, potentially irreversible movement disorder), ECG changes, hypotension, hypertension, visual disturbances, allergic reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), blood count decreases, liver inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis), hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin levels leading to potential side effects such as galactorrhea, gynecomastia, amenorrhea).

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur, especially those that are serious or persistent, immediate medical advice should be sought.


### How it Works
Pipamperone is a dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the activity of dopamine and serotonin in the brain.  It exhibits higher affinity for 5-HT2A and D4 receptors compared to D2 receptors. By modulating these neurotransmitter systems, pipamperone helps to reduce the symptoms of psychosis and aggression.  The precise mechanism of its effects on aggression is not fully understood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to pipamperone or any formulation components; severe CNS depression; brainstem disorders (like Parkinson's disease); concomitant use with other seizure-threshold-lowering agents.
* **Increased Risk:** QT prolongation, stroke (especially in those with risk factors), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, slowed intracardiac conduction.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to other butyrophenones, parabens (in liquid formulations), those taking CNS depressants, individuals with stroke risk factors, the elderly, and those with hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Avoid use during pregnancy, particularly the third trimester.  Newborns exposed to antipsychotics during the third trimester are at risk of adverse effects.  Pipamperone is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking pipamperone?** A: No, especially not immediately after taking a dose, as drowsiness is a potential side effect.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how pipamperone affects you.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking pipamperone?** A: No. Alcohol can interact with pipamperone, increasing the risk of side effects and reducing the effectiveness of the medication.

* **Q: How should I store pipamperone?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking pipamperone suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before changing your dosage or discontinuing treatment.
