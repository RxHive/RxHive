# Povidone Iodine

**Generic Name:** Povidone-iodine

**Usage:** Povidone-iodine is a topical antiseptic used to prevent or treat infections of the skin.  Its uses include:

* **Pre-operative skin disinfection:**  Cleaning the skin before surgery or other procedures to reduce the risk of infection.
* **Treatment of minor wounds:**  Treating cuts, scrapes, burns, and abrasions to prevent infection.
* **Treatment of skin infections:**  Helping to manage minor skin infections such as impetigo or infected eczema.
* **Prevention of infection in pressure ulcers:**  Assisting in the prevention of infection in bedsores.
* **Disinfection of medical equipment:**  Although less common now, it can be used to disinfect certain medical equipment.


**Side Effects:**  While generally safe for topical use, povidone-iodine can cause side effects, including:

* **Skin irritation:**  Burning, stinging, redness, itching, or dryness at the application site. This is the most common side effect.
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, allergic reactions such as rash, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing can occur.  Stop use immediately and seek medical attention if this happens.
* **Staining:**  Povidone-iodine can stain skin, clothing, and other materials. This staining is usually temporary, but can be persistent on some fabrics.
* **Thyroid problems:**  Very rarely, absorption of large amounts of iodine can cause thyroid problems, particularly in individuals with pre-existing thyroid conditions. This is more likely with prolonged or extensive use.


**How it Works:** Povidone-iodine is a complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone.  The iodine is released slowly, providing a prolonged antiseptic effect.  It works by killing bacteria, viruses, and fungi through a process that disrupts their cell membranes and interferes with their metabolic processes. This broad-spectrum activity makes it effective against a wide range of microorganisms.
