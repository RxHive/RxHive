# Pentetate Zinc Trisodium
### Generic Name
Pentetate Zinc Trisodium (Zn-DTPA)

### Usage
Pentetate zinc trisodium (Zn-DTPA) is a medication used to remove radioactive metals like plutonium, americium, and curium from the body.  It's primarily used in cases of known or suspected internal contamination with these elements, aiming to accelerate their elimination.  This is crucial in situations like accidental exposure or nuclear incidents. While primarily used for internal contamination, it's important to note that it is not used for external contamination.  External decontamination requires different methods entirely.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Pentetate calcium trisodium (Ca-DTPA) is generally preferred as the initial dose within the first 24 hours after contamination because it's more effective during this period. Zn-DTPA should only be used initially if Ca-DTPA is unavailable.

**Adults:**

* **Internal contamination (Plutonium, Americium, Curium):**
    * **Intravenous (IV):** If Ca-DTPA isn't available within the first 24 hours, a single initial dose of 1 gram of Zn-DTPA is administered. After the first 24 hours, if continued chelation is needed, 1 gram of Zn-DTPA is given daily.  IV administration is preferred if the contamination route is uncertain or involves multiple routes.
    * **Inhalation (Nebulizer):** Zn-DTPA is diluted 1:1 with water or saline for nebulization.  This route is an alternative only if inhalation contamination occurred within the preceding 24 hours.

**Children:**

* **Internal contamination (Plutonium, Americium, Curium):**
    * **Children under 12 years:** If Ca-DTPA is unavailable within the first 24 hours, the initial IV dose is 14 mg/kg of Zn-DTPA (not exceeding 1 gram).  After 24 hours, if further treatment is needed, 14 mg/kg daily (not exceeding 1 gram) is given.
    * **Children 12 years and older/Adolescents:** Follow the adult dosage.
* **Inhalation:**  The safety and effectiveness of nebulized Zn-DTPA haven't been established in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, for heavily contaminated patients with renal impairment, high-efficiency high-flux dialysis may be used to enhance elimination.


### Side Effects

* Chills
* Fever
* Muscle cramps
* Nausea
* Itching (pruritus)
* Vomiting

While less common, serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or severe reactions.


### How it Works

Zn-DTPA works by binding to radioactive metals (like plutonium, americium, and curium) within the body. This binding forms a stable chelate, effectively removing the radioactive metal from its sites of interaction and allowing it to be filtered out of the bloodstream by the kidneys and excreted in the urine.  Essentially, it replaces the radioactive metal with zinc, making the radioactive substance easier to eliminate.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer.
* **Increased Risk:**  Nebulized Zn-DTPA may worsen asthma. Long-term use (several months) may deplete essential trace metals (e.g., magnesium, manganese, zinc) in the body.  Careful monitoring of these levels is crucial during treatment.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when administering Zn-DTPA via inhalation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Zn-DTPA is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  However, women with internal radioactive contamination should not breastfeed, regardless of whether they receive chelation therapy.  Appropriate safety measures must be taken when handling breast milk and other bodily fluids during this time.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: Treatment duration depends on the severity of contamination and the individual's response.  It's usually continued until the rate of radioactive metal elimination is deemed sufficient based on monitoring.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately.  Do not try to double up on doses.

* **Q: How is Zn-DTPA stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects are possible, particularly the depletion of trace metals with prolonged use.  Regular monitoring is crucial to assess any potential complications.

* **Q: Can Zn-DTPA treat all types of radioactive contamination?** A: No.  It is primarily effective for plutonium, americium, and curium.  Other types of radioactive contamination might require different treatments.
