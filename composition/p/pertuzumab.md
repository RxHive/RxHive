# Pertuzumab
### Generic Name
Pertuzumab

### Usage
Pertuzumab is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer.  This means it works against breast cancer cells that have an overabundance of the HER2 protein, a protein that promotes cell growth and division.  It's used in several settings:

* **Metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer:** This is breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumor site. Pertuzumab is typically used in combination with other medications, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) and docetaxel (Taxotere), to slow or stop the cancer's progression.

* **Early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer (adjuvant/neoadjuvant):** This refers to breast cancer that hasn't spread but requires additional treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence.  In the adjuvant setting, Pertuzumab is given *after* surgery and other treatments to help prevent the cancer from returning. In the neoadjuvant setting, it's given *before* surgery to shrink the tumor, making surgery more effective.  It's usually part of a combination therapy with other drugs, including trastuzumab.


### Dosage

Pertuzumab is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage varies depending on the specific treatment regimen and whether it's for metastatic or early-stage breast cancer.  The information below is for general guidance only and *should not* replace the instructions provided by your oncologist.

**Adults:**

* **Metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer:** Typically begins with an initial dose of 840 mg over 60 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 420 mg over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks.  This is usually combined with other chemotherapy agents.


* **Early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer (adjuvant/neoadjuvant):**  The starting dose is typically the same as for metastatic cancer (840 mg loading dose followed by 420 mg maintenance doses). The treatment duration is longer, usually 1 year (up to 18 cycles) for the adjuvant setting. For the neoadjuvant setting, treatment might last for 3-6 cycles before surgery, and then continue post-surgery to complete 1 year of treatment.


**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Pertuzumab in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are generally *not* recommended for Pertuzumab based solely on kidney or liver function. However,  dose modifications of other drugs in the combination therapy may be necessary depending on individual patient response and tolerability.  Your doctor will closely monitor your blood counts and other factors to determine if adjustments to any aspect of the treatment plan are required.  Specifically, careful monitoring of cardiac function (ejection fraction) is crucial and may necessitate temporary or permanent discontinuation of Pertuzumab.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Skin rash
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia)
* Infusion-related reactions (allergic-type reactions)


Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Cardiotoxicity (heart problems): Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart failure.  This is a serious risk, and your heart function will be closely monitored.
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 protein on the surface of cancer cells.  HER2 is a receptor that stimulates cell growth and division.  Pertuzumab works by binding to a specific part of the HER2 protein, preventing it from interacting with other HER2 proteins and forming dimers (pairs). This blockage of dimerization inhibits the signaling pathways that promote cancer cell growth, ultimately leading to slowed or stopped tumor growth and potentially the death of cancer cells.  It’s often used in combination with trastuzumab, which binds to a different part of the HER2 protein, enhancing the overall blocking effect.


### Precautions

* **Allergic reactions:**  Pertuzumab can cause allergic reactions, ranging from mild to severe (anaphylaxis).  Your healthcare provider will carefully monitor you for any signs of an allergic reaction during and after infusions.


* **Cardiotoxicity:** Pertuzumab can damage the heart. Your heart function (LVEF) will be carefully monitored before, during, and after treatment.


* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Pertuzumab can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose if used in combination with trastuzumab. Breastfeeding is not recommended during and for a significant period after Pertuzumab treatment.


* **Drug interactions:** While no major drug interactions are currently known, it’s crucial to inform your doctor about all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements) you are taking.


* **Other conditions:**  Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions or other health problems should discuss the risks and benefits of Pertuzumab with their healthcare provider.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long does Pertuzumab treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the type and stage of cancer and your individual response.  It can range from several months to a year or more.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to determine the best course of action.

* **Q: How is Pertuzumab stored?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Pertuzumab?** A:  While many side effects resolve after treatment, some, like cardiotoxicity or neuropathy, can be long-lasting.  Your doctor will monitor you for any long-term effects.

* **Q: Can I drive while on Pertuzumab?** A:  If you experience side effects like fatigue or dizziness, you should avoid driving or operating machinery until these subside.
