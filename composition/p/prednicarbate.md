# Prednicarbate
### Generic Name
Prednicarbate

### Usage

Prednicarbate is a topical corticosteroid used to relieve the inflammation and itching associated with corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  This means it's effective against skin conditions that respond well to corticosteroids.  Its primary use is for managing skin inflammation and itching, making it useful for a variety of conditions. While not explicitly listed for all conditions,  it's commonly used off-label for various inflammatory skin issues.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine if Prednicarbate is appropriate for your specific skin condition.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, apply a thin film of the 0.1% emollient cream or ointment to the affected skin areas twice daily (BID). Gently rub it in.  Treatment should stop once the condition is under control. If no improvement is seen within two weeks, a doctor should re-evaluate the diagnosis.

**Children:**

* **Children over 1 year old (cream only):** Apply a thin film of the 0.1% emollient cream twice daily to the affected areas. Gently rub it in. The safety and effectiveness for use beyond three weeks haven't been established in this age group.
* **Children 10 years and older (ointment only):** Apply a thin film of the 0.1% ointment twice daily to the affected areas. Gently rub it in.


**Important Note:** Prednicarbate cream's safety and effectiveness haven't been established for children under 1 year old, and its use in this age group is not recommended.  Similarly, Prednicarbate ointment's safety and effectiveness haven't been established in children under 10 years old.  Always follow a doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment for children.

### How it Works

Prednicarbate is a corticosteroid with intermediate potency. Topical corticosteroids like Prednicarbate work by reducing inflammation and itching.  They achieve this by inhibiting the production, release, and activity of substances in the body that cause inflammation. This process involves influencing the body's production of proteins that help control the inflammatory response.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Prednicarbate or any formulation component.
* Hypersensitivity to wool or lanolin (ingredients in some formulations).
* Use on skin infections (bacterial, fungal, tuberculosis, syphilitic, chickenpox, viral, or skin eruptions after vaccination).

**Increased Risk:**

* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Immunosuppression (weakened immune system)
* Systemic effects (Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, glycosuria â€“ these are rare with topical use but possible with extensive or prolonged application)
* Kaposi sarcoma (a type of skin cancer)
* Adrenal suppression (can lead to hypercortisolism or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis)
* Reduced growth velocity (in children)

**Use with Caution:**

* In pediatric patients.
* In breastfeeding women (excretion in breast milk is unknown).  Avoid applying to the nipples.
* Avoid contact with latex products as the ointment/cream may damage latex.
