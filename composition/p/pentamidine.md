# Pentamidine
### Generic Name
Pentamidine

### Usage

Pentamidine is an antiprotozoal medication primarily used to treat and prevent *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP).  PCP is a serious lung infection, particularly affecting individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Pentamidine is often considered when other first-line treatments are unsuitable or ineffective.  It's also used, though less commonly and often off-label, in the treatment of the hemolymphatic stage of West African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) caused by *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense*.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM], or inhalation), and the patient's age and weight.  Precise dosing should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  The following information is for general knowledge and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **PCP Treatment (alternative):**  Intravenous (IV): 4 mg/kg/day for 21 days. The dose may be reduced to 3 mg/kg/day if toxicity occurs.
* **PCP Prophylaxis (primary and secondary):** Inhalation: 300 mg once every 4 weeks using a Respirgard II nebulizer. Prophylaxis should continue until CD4 counts remain above 200 cells/mmÂ³ for more than 3 months after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART).
* **West African Trypanosomiasis (hemolymphatic stage):** IV or IM: 4 mg/kg/day for 7-10 days.

**Children:**

Dosage for children varies significantly based on weight and the specific condition.  Pediatric dosages are usually calculated based on body weight (mg/kg) and are best determined by a physician experienced in treating these infections.  Generally,  for PCP treatment, the dose ranges from 3-4 mg/kg daily for 14-21 days intravenously or intramuscularly.  For trypanosomiasis, the dose is similarly calculated at 4 mg/kg/day for 7-10 days.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Always consult a doctor for appropriate dosage modifications in such cases.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Changes in taste (dysgeusia)
* Loss of appetite (anorexia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Changes in blood cell counts (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia)
* Liver enzyme elevation
* Kidney problems (increased creatinine, BUN)
* Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
* Pancreatitis
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* QT prolongation (heart rhythm disturbance)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Pentamidine interferes with the growth and reproduction of certain parasites and fungi.  It does this by disrupting several essential processes within their cells, including DNA and RNA synthesis, and the creation of essential proteins and lipids. This ultimately leads to the parasite's or fungus's death and helps resolve the infection.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Pentamidine should not be used by individuals with known allergies to pentamidine or any of its components.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Use with caution in patients with impaired kidney or liver function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:** Use cautiously in patients with existing heart conditions due to the risk of QT prolongation and hypotension.
* **Diabetes:**  Monitor blood glucose levels closely, as pentamidine can affect blood sugar.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pentamidine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  The decision to use pentamidine during pregnancy should be made carefully with a physician, weighing the benefits against the potential risks. Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, necessitating careful consideration of the risks versus benefits for the nursing infant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pentamidine can interact with other medications.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are currently taking.

### FAQs

**Q: How is Pentamidine stored?**

A:  Store pentamidine as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

**Q: Can I stop taking Pentamidine if I feel better?**

A: No, complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if you feel better, unless otherwise instructed by your doctor.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and potential recurrence of the infection.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on how to proceed if you miss a dose. Do not double the dose.

**Q: Is Pentamidine safe for long-term use?**

A:  Long-term use of pentamidine can increase the risk of side effects.  Your healthcare provider will carefully monitor you for any adverse reactions.

**Q:  Are there alternative treatments for PCP?**

A: Yes, there are other medications available to treat PCP, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), which is generally the preferred first-line treatment.  Pentamidine is often reserved for situations where TMP-SMX is not tolerated or ineffective.
