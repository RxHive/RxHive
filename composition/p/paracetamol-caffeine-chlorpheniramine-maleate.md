# Paracetamol + Caffeine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Caffeine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* **Fever:** Paracetamol reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates body temperature.
* **Pain:** Paracetamol relieves mild to moderate pain, such as headache, muscle aches, and body aches.
* **Congestion:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that helps to dry up nasal secretions and reduce congestion.
* **Fatigue:** Caffeine acts as a stimulant to help combat fatigue and increase alertness.  However, its effectiveness in treating cold and flu fatigue is limited and debated.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, stomach upset.
* **Less Common:**  Blurred vision, headache, nervousness, insomnia, difficulty urinating.
* **Rare but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), liver damage (with high doses of paracetamol).


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever and relieves pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.  The exact mechanism of action is not fully understood.
* **Caffeine:** Acts as a central nervous system stimulant, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue. It may also enhance the analgesic (pain-relieving) effects of paracetamol.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction or cold. This helps reduce nasal congestion and runny nose.
