# Proparacaine + Chlorbutol

**Generic Name:** Proparacaine Hydrochloride + Chlorobutanol

**Usage:** This combination is a topical ophthalmic anesthetic.  It's used to numb the eye temporarily before procedures like eye examinations, corneal surgery, or removal of foreign bodies from the eye. The proparacaine provides the anesthetic effect, while the chlorobutanol acts as a preservative to prevent microbial growth in the solution.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and temporary, but can include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation:** This is common upon application.
* **Temporary blurred vision:**  This usually resolves quickly after the medication wears off.
* **Eye irritation or redness:** This is also relatively common.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions are possible. Symptoms may include itching, swelling, or rash around the eyes.
* **Corneal damage (rare but serious):** Prolonged or frequent use of proparacaine can damage the cornea.  This is why it's only for short-term use before specific procedures.


**How it Works:**

* **Proparacaine Hydrochloride:** This is a local anesthetic that blocks nerve impulses in the cornea and conjunctiva, preventing the transmission of pain signals to the brain.  It works by blocking sodium channels in nerve cell membranes.
* **Chlorobutanol:** This is a preservative that helps prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi in the eye drop solution, ensuring its sterility and extending its shelf life.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it last?** The numbing effect of proparacaine usually lasts for 15-20 minutes.
* **Can I use it more than once a day?**  No, it should only be used as directed by a doctor or ophthalmologist, typically just before a specific procedure. Frequent use can damage the cornea.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any significant side effects, such as severe eye pain, allergic reactions, or persistent vision changes, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.
* **Can I wear contact lenses after using it?**  Generally, you should wait until the numbing effect wears off and your vision has cleared before reinserting contact lenses.  Follow your ophthalmologist's instructions.
* **Is it safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor or ophthalmologist.
* **Can I drive after using it?**  It's advisable to wait until your vision has returned to normal before driving, as blurred vision is a potential side effect.
* **How should I store it?**  Store the eye drops at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and heat.  Discard any remaining solution after the expiration date.
