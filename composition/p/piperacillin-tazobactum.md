# Piperacillin + Tazobactum

**Generic Name:** Piperacillin/Tazobactam

**Usage:**

Piperacillin/Tazobactam is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat a variety of serious bacterial infections in adults and children.  These infections can affect many parts of the body, including:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen, such as peritonitis (infection of the lining of the abdomen) and infections after abdominal surgery.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infections):**  Severe infections where bacteria have spread to the bloodstream.
* **Lower respiratory tract infections:**  Pneumonia and other lung infections, often used when other antibiotics have failed.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:**  Infections of the skin, such as cellulitis and abscesses.
* **Gynecological infections:** Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and other infections of the female reproductive organs.
* **Bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis):** Infections of the bones and joints.
* **Infections in neutropenic patients:** Patients with low white blood cell counts (often due to chemotherapy) are highly susceptible to serious infections, and this antibiotic is frequently used.


**Specific infections and use should always be determined by a doctor.**  It's crucial to remember that it's not effective against viral infections (like the common cold or flu).

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, piperacillin/tazobactam can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity from mild to serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting**
* **Diarrhea**
* **Rash**
* **Headache**
* **Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness) if given intravenously or intramuscularly**


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):**  A potentially life-threatening bowel infection.
* **Allergic reactions:**  ranging from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention).
* **Increased risk of bleeding:**  Due to its effect on blood clotting factors.
* **Kidney problems:**  Increased creatinine levels in blood tests.
* **Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver):**  Elevated liver enzymes.
* **Seizures (especially at high doses):** More common in patients with pre-existing kidney or neurological conditions.


**How it Works:**

Piperacillin/tazobactam is a combination antibiotic.  Piperacillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial death.  Tazobactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor.  Many bacteria produce β-lactamases, enzymes that break down penicillin-type antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Tazobactam protects piperacillin from being broken down by these enzymes, extending its effectiveness against a wider range of bacteria, including those that are resistant to other penicillins.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take piperacillin/tazobactam with other medications?**  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as interactions can occur.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking piperacillin/tazobactam?**  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this antibiotic, as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **How long should I take piperacillin/tazobactam?**  The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs can include rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or lightheadedness. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.
