# Piperacillin + Tazobactum
### Generic Name
Piperacillin/Tazobactam

### Usage

Piperacillin/Tazobactam is a powerful combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of serious bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating infections caused by bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.  This includes infections of the:

* **Respiratory tract:**  Pneumonia, lung abscesses, and other serious lung infections.
* **Skin and skin structures:**  Cellulitis, wound infections, and abscesses.
* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen, often following surgery or related to appendicitis, peritonitis, or diverticulitis.
* **Gynecological infections:** Pelvic inflammatory disease and other serious infections of the female reproductive organs.
* **Septicemia:**  A life-threatening bloodstream infection.
* **Meningitis:** Infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (in certain cases, often in combination with other antibiotics).
* **Bone and joint infections (Osteomyelitis):**  Serious infections of the bones and joints.

While effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), it's crucial to remember that this medication is prescribed for *serious* infections and not for common ailments like the common cold or flu.  The specific bacteria causing the infection should ideally be identified through laboratory testing to ensure appropriate treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage of Piperacillin/Tazobactam varies greatly depending on the severity of the infection, the patient's weight, renal function (kidney health), and the route of administration (IV or IM).  This information should *never* be used in place of a healthcare professional's prescription.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose.

**Typical Adult Dosages:**

* **Intravenous (IV):**  The typical dose ranges from 3.375 grams to 4.5 grams every 6-8 hours, administered over at least 30 minutes. Higher doses may be used in severe infections.  The dose may need to be adjusted for patients with kidney problems.
* **Intramuscular (IM):**  While less common, intramuscular administration might be considered in certain situations.  The dosage and frequency will be prescribed by the physician.


**Pediatric Dosages:**

Pediatric dosing is highly individualized and depends heavily on the child's weight and the specific infection.  A pediatrician will calculate the appropriate dose, ensuring safety and efficacy.  There are different formulations available for children (e.g., diluted solutions for IV administration).

**Other Forms:**  Piperacillin/Tazobactam is primarily available as a powder for reconstitution for IV or IM injection.  There is no oral formulation.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash
* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)
* Elevated liver enzymes (detected through blood tests)

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis – a severe, life-threatening reaction)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (C. diff) – a potentially serious bowel infection
* Seizures (especially in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or kidney problems)
* Leukopenia (decrease in white blood cells)
* Thrombocytopenia (decrease in platelets)

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Piperacillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  It prevents bacteria from building their protective outer walls, leading to bacterial death.  Tazobactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by some bacteria that can break down penicillin-type antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Tazobactam prevents this breakdown, allowing Piperacillin to effectively target a wider range of bacteria, including those resistant to penicillin alone.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergies should be cautiously evaluated before using this medication as there’s a risk of cross-reactivity.
* **Kidney problems:**  The dose needs to be adjusted in patients with impaired kidney function.
* **Bleeding disorders:**  Use caution in patients with bleeding disorders.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Use only when clearly needed under the close supervision of a healthcare provider. The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.
* **Drug interactions:**  Piperacillin/Tazobactam may interact with other medications. Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.
* **Prolonged use:**  Prolonged use can increase the risk of developing resistant bacteria or other infections like C. diff.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Piperacillin/Tazobactam when I feel better?**  A: No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Piperacillin/Tazobactam?** A:  There's no direct interaction between alcohol and this medication, but excessive alcohol consumption can affect your overall health and may worsen side effects. It's best to avoid excessive alcohol during treatment.

* **Q: How should I store Piperacillin/Tazobactam?** A:  Store the medication as directed by your pharmacist.  Usually, this involves storing the powder in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.  Reconstituted solutions should be refrigerated and used within a specified timeframe.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on what to do if you miss a dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for children?** A: Piperacillin/Tazobactam can be used in children but only under the strict supervision of a pediatrician.  The dosage will be adjusted based on the child's weight and the severity of the infection.
