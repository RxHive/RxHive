# Phenylpropanolamine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Phenylpropanolamine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide  (Note: This combination is rarely, if ever, found as a commercially available product now.  Phenylpropanolamine has been largely removed from the market due to safety concerns.)


**Usage:**  *(Historically)* This combination was used as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication to treat the symptoms of the common cold and allergies.  Phenylpropanolamine acted as a decongestant, while dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppressed coughs.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects listed below are based on the individual components and should not be considered exhaustive, especially given the rarity of this combination product.

* **Phenylpropanolamine:**  Increased blood pressure, headache, nervousness, dizziness, insomnia, palpitations, nausea, vomiting.  More serious, though rare, side effects included stroke and heart attack.  These serious risks led to its removal from most OTC medications.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, constipation, vomiting.  In high doses, it can have hallucinogenic effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Phenylpropanolamine:**  This is a sympathomimetic amine that acts as a decongestant by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.  This reduces swelling and congestion.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This is a non-opioid cough suppressant (antitussive). It works by affecting the cough center in the brain.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination still available?**  No, it is extremely unlikely to find a commercially available product containing both phenylpropanolamine and dextromethorphan hydrobromide due to the safety concerns surrounding phenylpropanolamine.
* **Are there safer alternatives?** Yes, many safer and more effective alternatives exist for treating cold and allergy symptoms.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for recommendations.  Decongestants like pseudoephedrine (with cautions about potential cardiovascular side effects) are still available, though often behind the counter.  Numerous cough suppressants are also available, often containing guaifenesin (an expectorant) or other antitussive agents.
* **What should I do if I experience serious side effects?** Seek immediate medical attention.
