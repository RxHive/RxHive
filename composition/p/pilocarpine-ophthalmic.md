# Pilocarpine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Pilocarpine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage

Pilocarpine ophthalmic solution is primarily used to lower high intraocular pressure (IOP).  This makes it a crucial medication in managing two main eye conditions:

* **Open-angle glaucoma:** This is a common type of glaucoma where the drainage angle of the eye remains open, but the fluid drainage is impaired, leading to increased IOP. Pilocarpine helps improve fluid outflow, reducing pressure and preventing damage to the optic nerve.

* **Ocular hypertension:** This condition involves elevated IOP without any visible damage to the optic nerve.  Pilocarpine helps control IOP to prevent the development of glaucoma.

Pilocarpine also plays a role in:

* **Acute angle-closure glaucoma:** In this emergency situation, the iris blocks the drainage angle, causing a rapid spike in IOP. Pilocarpine is often part of a multi-drug regimen to quickly lower the pressure.

* **Postoperative IOP elevation:**  Following eye surgery, such as laser procedures, pilocarpine can help prevent a rise in IOP.

* **Miosis induction:** Pilocarpine induces constriction of the pupil (miosis), which is sometimes needed before certain ophthalmic procedures.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The following are general guidelines only and should not be considered medical advice:


**Adults:**

* **Open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension:**  Typically, 1 drop of 1%, 2%, or 4% solution is instilled into the affected eye(s) up to four times daily. The strength and frequency are determined by the doctor based on individual needs and response.  Treatment usually begins with the 1% concentration.

* **Acute angle-closure glaucoma:**  Usually, 1 drop of 2% solution is used as part of a broader treatment plan, potentially repeated every 30-60 minutes if IOP remains high (above 40 mmHg).

* **Postoperative IOP prevention:**  1-2 drops (5 minutes apart for two drops) of 1%, 2%, or 4% solution are instilled 15-60 minutes before surgery.

* **Miosis induction:** 1-2 drops (5 minutes apart for two drops) of 1%, 2%, or 4% solution are instilled into the affected eye(s).


**Children:**

Dosage for children, especially infants, is determined by the doctor and differs significantly based on age and the specific condition.  Lower concentrations and less frequent administration are typically used.  Specific instructions for pediatric use will be given by a physician.


**Administration:**  After instillation, gently press on the inner corner of the eye (lacrimal sac) for about two minutes to minimize systemic absorption.  If other eye drops are being used, allow at least 5 minutes between administrations.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Burning or stinging in the eye
* Eye redness
* Headache
* Blurred vision
* Reduced visual acuity (nearsightedness)


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects may include:

* Severe eye pain
* Changes in vision
* Allergic reactions


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist, meaning it mimics the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in eye function.  By stimulating specific receptors (muscarinic receptors) in the eye, pilocarpine causes:

1. **Miosis:**  The pupil constricts.
2. **Ciliary muscle contraction:** This affects the eye's ability to focus (accommodation).
3. **Increased outflow of aqueous humor:** This is the fluid that fills the eye; increased outflow helps lower IOP.  The reduction in IOP is the primary therapeutic effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pilocarpine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to pilocarpine or any component of the formulation, and in conditions where pupillary constriction is undesirable (e.g., acute iritis and anterior uveitis).

* **Interactions:**  Pilocarpine can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Pilocarpine is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully known.  It's crucial to discuss the use of pilocarpine with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.

* **Specific populations:**  Older adults and patients with certain underlying health conditions (e.g., heart conditions, asthma, or urinary tract issues) may require careful monitoring while using pilocarpine.


* **Driving and activities:**  Blurred vision is a potential side effect; avoid driving or operating machinery until vision clears.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for pilocarpine to work?** A: The effect on IOP varies but typically begins within 30-60 minutes.

* **Q: How should I store pilocarpine?** A: Store pilocarpine as directed on the label; usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I use pilocarpine with contact lenses?** A: Remove contact lenses before using pilocarpine; reinsert them after at least 10-15 minutes.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop pilocarpine suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping pilocarpine treatment.  Sudden discontinuation may lead to a rapid increase in IOP.
