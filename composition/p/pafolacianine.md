# Pafolacianine
### Generic Name
Pafolacianine

### Usage
Pafolacianine is an optical imaging agent used in adult patients with ovarian cancer.  Its primary use is as an adjunct to help surgeons identify malignant lesions during surgery.  This means it's used alongside other diagnostic methods to improve the accuracy of identifying cancerous tissue during the operation.  It does not treat ovarian cancer itself.

### Dosage
**Ovarian Cancer Imaging:** A single intravenous (IV) infusion of 0.025 mg/kg is administered 1 to 9 hours before surgery. The medication is diluted in 250 mL of 5% dextrose injection and infused over 60 minutes using a dedicated line.  It's crucial to use only 5% dextrose injection as the diluent; other diluents can cause Pafolacianine to aggregate, potentially leading to infusion reactions.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin <3x ULN and AST > ULN).  Severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3x ULN and any AST elevation) hasn't been studied.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (CrCl of 30-89 mL/min). Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) hasn't been studied.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Pafolacianine in pediatric patients haven't been established.

**Important Pre-Administration Steps:**  A pregnancy test is required for females of reproductive potential before administration.  Folate, folic acid, or folate-containing supplements must be discontinued 48 hours prior to administration. Prophylactic antihistamines and/or anti-nausea medication may be considered to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**
* Nausea

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia
* Pruritus (itching)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Flushing
* Chest discomfort

Serious side effects are less frequent but can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Pafolacianine is a fluorescent dye that targets folate receptors (FR), which are often overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells.  It binds to these receptors with high affinity, is taken up by the cancer cells, and concentrates in FR-positive cancerous tissues.  During surgery, a special near-infrared (NIR) imaging system detects the fluorescence emitted by Pafolacianine, highlighting the cancerous areas for the surgeon.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Pregnancy:** Pafolacianine may harm a developing fetus.  A pregnancy test is mandatory before administration in women of reproductive age.
* **Lactation:** It's unknown whether Pafolacianine is excreted in breast milk.  The risks and benefits of breastfeeding should be considered in consultation with a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Folate, folic acid, or folate-containing supplements can interfere with Pafolacianine's binding to cancer cells, potentially hindering its ability to identify malignant tissue.  Avoid these supplements for 48 hours before administration.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, chest discomfort, and itching, are possible.  If a reaction occurs, stop the infusion immediately and provide appropriate treatment.
* **Incorrect Diluent:** Using a diluent other than 5% dextrose injection can cause Pafolacianine aggregation and potentially lead to infusion reactions.
* **Interpretation:**  False-positive and false-negative results are possible.  The absence of fluorescence does not rule out cancer. Fluorescence can also be seen in non-cancerous tissues.
* **Training:** Pafolacianine should only be used by surgeons trained in the use of NIR imaging systems for fluorescence-guided surgery.



### FAQs
* **Q: How long before surgery is Pafolacianine administered?** A: It's administered intravenously 1 to 9 hours before surgery.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while receiving Pafolacianine?** A: Discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor to avoid potential interactions.  Especially avoid folate supplements for 48 hours before and after the infusion.

* **Q: How is Pafolacianine stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with the medication.

* **Q: Is Pafolacianine a cancer treatment?** A: No, it's an imaging agent to help surgeons identify cancer during surgery; it doesn't treat the cancer itself.

* **Q:  What if the test results are negative?** A: A negative result doesn't definitively rule out the presence of cancer. Other diagnostic methods should be considered.
