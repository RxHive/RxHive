# Pyrvinium
### Generic Name
Pyrvinium

### Usage
Pyrvinium is an anthelmintic medication primarily used to treat enterobiasis, commonly known as pinworm infection, caused by the parasite *Enterobius vermicularis*.  While effective, it has largely been replaced by newer, equally effective and better-tolerated anthelmintics like mebendazole and pyrantel.  Research is ongoing to explore its potential in cancer treatment, investigating its ability to inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells.

### Dosage

**Enterobiasis (Pinworm Infection):**

* **Adults and Children:** The typical dose is 5 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight, given as a single oral dose.  The maximum single dose is 350 mg.  A second dose may be necessary in two to three weeks if the infection persists.

**Dosage Forms:** Pyrvinium is typically available as an oral suspension (liquid) or tablets.  Always follow the specific dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance if you have these conditions.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal cramps
* Skin rashes
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  It's crucial to contact a doctor immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Pyrvinium's mechanism of action involves inhibiting the oxygen uptake of the adult pinworm. This respiratory inhibition leads to a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis, ultimately harming the parasite and eliminating the infection.  The exact mechanism for its potential anticancer effects is still under investigation.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Pyrvinium is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to pyrvinium or any of its components.
* **Photosensitivity:** Pyrvinium can increase photosensitivity.  Avoid excessive sun exposure, use sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection, and avoid tanning beds while taking this medication. Concomitant use with certain drugs (oxytetracycline, doxycycline, nalidixic acid, voriconazole, amiodarone, hydrochlorothiazide, naproxen, piroxicam, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine) may further increase this risk.
* **Gastrointestinal Disturbances:** Pyrvinium may cause gastrointestinal upset.
* **Children under 10 kg:** Use caution in children weighing less than 10 kg.
* **Geriatric Patients:**  Use caution in older adults.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pyrvinium is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy as it's poorly absorbed. However, its excretion in breast milk is unknown, so the benefits and risks should be carefully weighed.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to identify potential drug interactions.

### FAQs
