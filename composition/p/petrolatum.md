# Petrolatum
### Generic Name
Petrolatum

### Usage

Petrolatum is a semi-solid, jelly-like substance derived from petroleum.  It's available in two primary forms: ophthalmic (for the eyes) and topical (for the skin).

* **Ophthalmic Petrolatum:**  Primarily used as a lubricant for dry eyes, providing relief from dryness, irritation, and discomfort. It helps to maintain moisture on the surface of the eye.

* **Topical Petrolatum:** This is a versatile product with several uses:
    * **Protecting minor wounds:** Forms a protective barrier over minor cuts, scrapes, burns (including sunburns), and abrasions, helping to prevent infection and promote healing.
    * **Treating chapped skin and lips:**  Soothes and protects dry, cracked, or chapped skin and lips, preventing further moisture loss.
    * **Protecting skin from environmental factors:** Creates a barrier against wind, cold, and other environmental elements that can dry out the skin.
    * **Preventing diaper rash:** Its occlusive properties help prevent moisture from irritating the skin in the diaper area.  It's useful in preventing diaper rash or skin irritation due to incontinence.  
    * **Treating eczema:** Can help to soothe and protect skin affected by eczema, reducing dryness and irritation.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the form (ophthalmic or topical) and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.

**Ophthalmic (for the eyes):**

* **Adults:** A small amount (about Â¼ inch) of ointment is applied to the inside of the lower eyelid after pulling down the lower lid.  Application frequency can range from once to several times daily, depending on the severity of dry eye.

* **Children:**  Safety and efficacy in children haven't been established. Consult a pediatrician before use.


**Topical (for the skin):**

* **Adults and Children:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area as needed. For minor wounds, it's often recommended to apply multiple times daily for up to 7 days. For dry skin or lip protection, apply as often as necessary.  For diaper rash, apply at each diaper change.

Specific instructions will vary based on the product formulation and the intended use.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Generally well-tolerated.  However, rare instances of allergic reactions (skin rash, itching) are possible.  With ophthalmic use, temporary blurring of vision or mild eye irritation might occur.

* **Less Common (but serious):**  Severe allergic reactions are rare but can occur. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or hives.

* **Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and contact a doctor or pharmacist.


### How it Works

Petrolatum works primarily as a **barrier agent**.  It forms a protective, occlusive film over the skin or eye surface, preventing moisture loss through evaporation. This helps to maintain hydration and protect against external irritants. In the case of the eyes, it provides lubrication and reduces friction.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Avoid use if you have a known allergy to petrolatum or any petroleum-derived products.
* **Wounds:** Do not use topical petrolatum on deep wounds, puncture wounds, animal bites, or severe burns.  These require professional medical attention.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe, it's best to consult your doctor or other healthcare provider before using petrolatum during pregnancy or breastfeeding, especially for topical use near the breasts.
* **Eye use:** If using ophthalmic petrolatum, avoid touching the tip of the tube to your eye to prevent contamination. If eye irritation persists or worsens, discontinue use and consult a doctor.
* **Other medications:**  Petrolatum generally doesn't interact significantly with other medications, but inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking to ensure safety.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use petrolatum on open wounds?** A: No, only on minor cuts and scrapes. Deep or infected wounds need medical attention.

* **Q: How long can I store petrolatum?** A: Check the expiration date on the packaging. Properly stored, it generally remains effective for a considerable period.

* **Q: Is petrolatum safe for babies?** A:  Topical petrolatum is generally considered safe for babies, especially for diaper rash, but consult your pediatrician for any concerns.  Ophthalmic use in babies is not recommended without consulting a pediatrician.

* **Q:  Can I use petrolatum with contact lenses?** A:  If using ophthalmic petrolatum, remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 10-15 minutes before reinserting.
