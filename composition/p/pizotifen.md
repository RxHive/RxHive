# Pizotifen
### Generic Name
Pizotifen

### Usage
Pizotifen, also known as Pizotyline, is a medication primarily used for the *prophylactic* treatment of migraine headaches.  This means it's used to *prevent* migraine attacks from occurring, not to stop a migraine once it has started.  It's important to understand that pizotifen is *not* effective for treating acute migraine pain or tension headaches. Its use is specifically targeted at reducing the frequency and severity of migraine episodes over time.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For migraine prophylaxis, the oral dosage usually starts at 0.5 mg taken once daily at bedtime.  The dose may be gradually increased by the doctor to a maximum of 6 mg per day.  Higher doses (above 3mg) should be divided and administered throughout the day.  A therapeutic response often takes several weeks to develop.  It's crucial to never stop taking pizotifen suddenly; the dosage must be gradually reduced over two weeks under medical supervision.

**Children (aged 12 and older):**  The starting dose is also 0.5 mg at bedtime, with a gradual increase possible, up to a maximum of 1.5 mg per day.  Again, abrupt discontinuation is to be avoided.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and dose adjustments might be necessary based on individual patient factors.  A healthcare professional should guide any necessary changes.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Increased appetite and weight gain
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* Agitation or aggression (especially in children)
* Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Hallucinations
* Liver problems (hepatitis, increased liver enzymes, jaundice)
* Allergic reactions (rash, urticaria)
* Seizures
* Sleep disturbances

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Pizotifen's precise mechanism in preventing migraines isn't entirely understood. However, it's known to be a strong serotonin and tryptamine antagonist, meaning it blocks the effects of these neurotransmitters.  It also has weak anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and anti-kinin effects.  The theory is that it inhibits serotonin reuptake in blood platelets, influencing blood vessel tone and potentially reducing the distension of arteries in the head.  It may also alter pain thresholds by affecting the permeability of cranial vessels.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Pizotifen should not be used in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to pizotifen or any of its components.
* Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
* Gastric outlet obstruction.
* Children under 12 years of age.


**Warnings and Cautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with epilepsy, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver impairment, obesity, decreased gastrointestinal motility, urinary retention, benign prostatic hyperplasia, glaucoma, or those intolerant to anticholinergic agents.
* May cause drowsiness; avoid activities requiring alertness (driving, operating machinery).
*  Avoid alcohol consumption.
*  Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Use should be avoided if possible during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Other migraine preventative medications are preferred. Pizotifen is excreted in breast milk.
*  Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided.  Dosage should be gradually reduced under medical supervision.

A: It may take several weeks to see a noticeable reduction in migraine frequency and severity.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
