# Pregabalin + Etoricoxib
### Generic Name
Pregabalin + Etoricoxib (Combination)

**Note:**  Pregabalin and Etoricoxib are not typically combined into a single formulation.  They are often prescribed together, but as separate medications. This information describes each drug individually and then discusses their combined use.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.

### Usage

**Pregabalin:** Primarily used to treat neuropathic pain (nerve pain), fibromyalgia (chronic widespread pain), and anxiety disorders. It can also be used as an adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in adults.

**Etoricoxib:** A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  It's commonly used to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain, such as that following surgery or injury.


When prescribed together, pregabalin and etoricoxib aim to provide a multi-modal approach to pain management, combining the nerve pain relief of pregabalin with the anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects of etoricoxib.  This combination is often used for conditions involving both inflammatory and neuropathic pain components.

### Dosage

**Pregabalin:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and individual patient factors.  It's usually started at a low dose and gradually increased as needed under medical supervision.  

* **Oral:**  Typical starting dose for pain is 75mg twice daily, which may be increased to a maximum of 600mg per day. For anxiety, starting doses are lower.
* **IV:** Pregabalin is not typically administered intravenously.

**Etoricoxib:** Dosage also varies based on the condition and individual factors.

* **Oral:** Doses range from 30mg to 120mg daily, depending on the severity of pain and the specific indication.

**Combined Use:**  The specific dosage of each drug when prescribed together will be determined by your physician, considering your individual needs and health status.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage exactly as directed.  


### Side Effects

**Pregabalin:**

* Common: Dizziness, drowsiness, weight gain, blurred vision, swelling in the hands or feet.
* Less Common, but Serious:  Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

**Etoricoxib:**

* Common:  Headache, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, swelling in the hands or feet.
* Less Common, but Serious: Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure, serious skin reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.


It is vital to report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

**Pregabalin:**  It works by binding to specific calcium channels in the nervous system, reducing the release of neurotransmitters that transmit pain signals. This reduces the intensity of pain signals reaching the brain. For anxiety, it likely modulates the activity of neurotransmitters involved in anxiety and mood regulation.

**Etoricoxib:**  It inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, etoricoxib decreases inflammation and alleviates pain.


### Precautions

**Pregabalin:**

* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to pregabalin.
* **Interactions:**  May interact with other medications that affect the central nervous system (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your doctor.
* **Elderly:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary in older adults due to reduced kidney function.


**Etoricoxib:**

* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to etoricoxib or other NSAIDs, severe heart failure, active peptic ulcer, history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* **Interactions:** May increase the risk of bleeding when taken with anticoagulants (blood thinners).  May also interact with other NSAIDs and certain heart medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Should be avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy.  The use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered. Consult your doctor.
* **Elderly:**  Increased risk of side effects, particularly gastrointestinal problems and cardiovascular events.


**Combined Use Precautions:**  The combined use of pregabalin and etoricoxib increases the risk of certain side effects, particularly drowsiness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal problems.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is crucial.
