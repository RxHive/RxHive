# Povidone Iodine (Topical)
### Generic Name
Povidone-Iodine (Topical)

### Usage
Povidone-iodine is a topical antiseptic used to treat minor wounds and prevent infections.  Its primary use is as a disinfectant for the skin, commonly applied before surgery or other procedures to reduce the risk of infection. It's also used to treat minor cuts, scrapes, burns, and abrasions.  Secondary uses include treating some vaginal infections (though this should always be done under the guidance of a healthcare provider).  It's crucial to understand that povidone-iodine is for external use only; it should never be ingested.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (solution, swab, douche, suppository) and the intended use.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or on the product label.

**Adults:**

* **Antisepsis (minor wounds):**  Various formulations (â‰¤10%): Apply to the affected area 1-3 times daily.
* **Preoperative skin disinfection:** Solution (7.5%): Apply to the surgical site, moving outward in concentric circles for at least 5 minutes using a saturated sponge. Blot with a sterile towel and repeat the application. Swabs (10%): Apply to the operative site before surgery using the applicator.
* **Vaginal irritation (consult a healthcare professional before use):** Douche (0.3%): Insert 0.3% solution once daily for 3 days. Suppository: 200 mg once daily at bedtime.

**Children:**  Dosage is generally the same as for adults for antiseptic purposes and preoperative skin disinfection, but always consult a pediatrician before using it on children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always discuss any concerns with your doctor.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Irritation
* Burning sensation
* Skin redness
* Itching

Less common, but more serious, side effects are possible and may include allergic reactions (such as skin rash, hives, swelling), and in rare instances, hypothyroidism in newborns whose mothers used povidone-iodine before delivery.  If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a doctor.


### How it Works
Povidone-iodine's antimicrobial action comes from the release of free iodine from the povidone-iodine complex. This free iodine penetrates microbial cell membranes and interacts with essential cellular components like proteins, nucleotides, and fatty acids.  This interaction disrupts microbial function and leads to cell death, effectively killing bacteria and other microorganisms.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Povidone-iodine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to iodine, povidone, or any other component of the formulation.
* **Interactions:** Povidone-iodine can interact with certain other medications.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are currently taking.  Specifically, it can decrease the effectiveness of collagenase and allogeneic cultured keratinocytes/fibroblasts in bovine collagen.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Povidone-iodine is categorized as pregnancy category C. This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and the risk to the human fetus is unknown.  Vaginal products should be avoided during pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **General Precautions:** Povidone-iodine is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes and large areas of the body.
