# Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Sodium Citrate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu, including:

* **Nasal congestion:** Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Runny nose and sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing runny nose and sneezing.
* **Headache, fever, and body aches:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).
* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a buffer, helping to prevent stomach upset and making the medication more palatable.  It may also contribute to urine alkalinization.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** Particularly from the chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:**  A common effect of antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Headache:**  Although paracetamol is included to relieve headaches, it can also be a side effect of other components.
* **Nausea:**  Less common but possible.
* **Insomnia:** Pseudoephedrine can cause difficulty sleeping, especially if taken later in the day.
* **Nervousness, dizziness, or palpitations:** More likely with higher doses of pseudoephedrine.
* **Urinary retention:** In rare cases.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling) are possible.

**How it Works:**

* **Pseudoephedrine:**  A sympathomimetic amine that acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal passages, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and reducing nasal congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that competitively blocks histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine and alleviating symptoms like runny nose and sneezing.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature) and reduces pain through mechanisms that are not fully understood.  It's believed to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in pain and inflammation.
* **Sodium Citrate:**  A buffer that helps maintain the pH of the medication and can improve the palatability and reduce gastric irritation.
