# Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Sodium Citrate
### Generic Name
Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Sodium Citrate


### Usage

This combination medication is a common over-the-counter remedy primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu.  It targets multiple symptoms simultaneously:

* **Pseudoephedrine:** A decongestant, it works to relieve stuffiness in the nasal passages by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nasal lining. This makes breathing easier.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, it helps to reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes caused by allergies or the common cold.  It blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer), it helps to lower fever and relieve mild to moderate pain associated with cold and flu symptoms, such as headache and muscle aches.

* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a buffering agent, helping to reduce the acidity of the formulation and improve its palatability.


The combination is effective in alleviating a range of cold and flu symptoms but does *not* treat the underlying viral infection itself.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation and the age of the patient.  Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**  This information is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for personalized dosage guidance.

* **Adults:**  Typical doses for oral formulations usually involve taking one or two tablets or capsules every 4-6 hours, as needed.

* **Children:**  Formulations specifically designed for children are available, with doses adjusted according to the child's weight and age. **Never give adult formulations to children.** Always check the child-specific dosage instructions carefully.

* **Intravenous (IV) Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously.  The components are designed for oral administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness or dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Headache
* Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
* Nervousness or anxiety (more likely with pseudoephedrine)

* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Seizures


If you experience any serious side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

The medication works by targeting several mechanisms involved in cold and flu symptoms.  Pseudoephedrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. Chlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergy-like symptoms. Paracetamol reduces fever by acting on the body's heat-regulating center in the brain and relieving pain through a different mechanism not fully understood.  Sodium citrate simply improves the overall formulation.
