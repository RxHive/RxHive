# Pyrazinamide
### Generic Name
Pyrazinamide

### Usage
Pyrazinamide is an anti-tubercular drug primarily used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  It's crucial to understand that pyrazinamide is *always* used in combination with other anti-tubercular medications; it's never given as a standalone treatment.  Its role is to shorten the overall treatment duration of TB, making it a vital component of effective TB regimens.  While its primary use is in pulmonary TB, it's also part of treatment regimens for extrapulmonary TB, such as tuberculous meningitis.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on age, weight, and the specific TB treatment regimen.  It's essential to follow the prescribed dosage exactly as directed by a healthcare professional.  There isn't a single "standard" dose.  Here's a summary of common dosage guidelines, but these should not replace the advice of a doctor or pharmacist:

**Adults (≥40 kg):** Dosage depends heavily on whether a once-daily, twice-weekly, or three-times-weekly Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) regimen is used.  Dosage is typically adjusted according to weight (e.g., 1000 mg, 1500 mg, 2000 mg daily or adjusted multiples for twice or three-times weekly).

**Children (<40 kg):** Dosage is typically calculated based on weight (mg/kg/dose), ranging from 30-50 mg/kg/dose, depending on the chosen regimen (once-daily, twice-weekly, three-times-weekly DOT).  Children ≥40 kg follow adult weight-based dosing.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Dosage adjustments for milder impairment are not clearly defined in manufacturer's labeling and require careful medical supervision.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/minute or those undergoing intermittent hemodialysis.  In these cases, the dosage is significantly reduced and administered after dialysis, typically 25-35 mg/kg/dose three times per week.


**Administration:** Pyrazinamide is typically administered orally, in tablet form.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage): This is a serious concern and requires immediate medical attention. Regular liver function tests are crucial during pyrazinamide treatment.
* Gout (due to increased uric acid levels)
* Pancreatitis
* Skin rash
* Interstitial nephritis (kidney inflammation)


**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Pyrazinamide's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood.  It's metabolized in the body to pyrazinoic acid, which is believed to act within the acidic environment of macrophages (immune cells) that contain *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. The precise way it inhibits bacterial growth is still under investigation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pyrazinamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, acute gout, and severe hepatic impairment.
* **Interactions:** Pyrazinamide can interact with several other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Examples include uricosuric drugs, estrogen-containing contraceptives, and certain vaccines.  It's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Patients with a history of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, chronic gout, porphyria, renal failure, or those receiving concurrent hepatotoxic medications (especially rifampin) should use pyrazinamide with caution under close medical supervision.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Pyrazinamide is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug. While TB treatment guidelines generally include it, the risks and benefits need careful consideration on a case-by-case basis.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take pyrazinamide with food?**  A: Pyrazinamide can generally be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How long will I need to take pyrazinamide?** A: The duration of treatment varies based on individual circumstances and the specific TB regimen.  It's usually part of an initial phase of treatment lasting several months.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for instructions.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Should I avoid alcohol while taking pyrazinamide?** A: Yes, it's crucial to avoid alcohol consumption during pyrazinamide treatment.
* **Q: How is pyrazinamide stored?** A: Store pyrazinamide as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
