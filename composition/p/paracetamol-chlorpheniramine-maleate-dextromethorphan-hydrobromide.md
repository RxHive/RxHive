# Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or flu.  Specifically, it targets:

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever and relieves mild to moderate pain.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  A type of antihistamine that helps to relieve runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes (allergic symptoms).
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps to reduce coughing.


This medication is typically used for short-term relief of cold and flu symptoms.  It does *not* treat the underlying cause of the illness.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect, particularly with chlorpheniramine maleate. Avoid driving or operating machinery while taking this medication.
* **Dry mouth:** This is also a common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Constipation:**  Possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Less common but possible.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Headache:** Less common but possible.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions are possible. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or other signs of an allergic reaction.

**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever by affecting areas of the brain that regulate temperature. It also reduces pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in pain and inflammation.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This reduces the symptoms associated with allergies, such as runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Suppresses the cough reflex by affecting the cough center in the brain.
