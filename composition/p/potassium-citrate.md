# Potassium Citrate
### Generic Name
Potassium Citrate

### Usage

Potassium citrate is primarily used to treat certain kidney problems and prevent the formation of kidney stones.  Its main applications include:

* **Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) with calcium stones:** RTA is a condition where the kidneys can't properly acidify the urine, leading to a buildup of acid in the blood.  Potassium citrate helps alkalinize the urine, reducing the risk of calcium stones.
* **Hypocitraturic Calcium Oxalate Nephrolithiasis:** This refers to kidney stones made of calcium oxalate, where the urine has low levels of citrate. Citrate helps prevent the formation of these stones.
* **Uric Acid Lithiasis (with or without calcium stones):**  Potassium citrate helps prevent uric acid stones by alkalinizing the urine.

Potassium citrate can also be used for general alkalinization purposes in specific situations determined by a physician.

### Dosage

Dosage for potassium citrate varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the individual's response to the medication, and the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release tablets).  **It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage exactly.**  Self-adjusting the dosage is dangerous and could lead to serious complications.

**Adult Dosage (examples only - always follow physician's instructions):**

The dosage is typically determined by monitoring urinary citrate levels and pH.  Dosage adjustments are usually made to reach a target urinary citrate level of 320-640 mg/day and a urine pH of 6.0-7.0.  The maximum daily dose is generally 100 mEq.  Different starting doses and titration schedules are used depending on the severity of hypocitraturia (low urinary citrate).  This is determined by testing.

* **Mild to Moderate Hypocitraturia:**  May start with 15 mEq twice daily or 10 mEq three times daily (extended-release).
* **Severe Hypocitraturia:**  May start with higher doses, such as 30 mEq twice daily or 20 mEq three times daily (extended-release).

Immediate-release formulations may have different dosing regimens.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of potassium citrate in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on factors such as kidney function and liver function.  Individuals with impaired kidney function are usually not candidates for this medication, and it's contraindicated in those with severe renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are usually mild but can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal distress
* Diarrhea

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood): This is a serious condition that can lead to heart problems.  Symptoms can include muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, and nausea.  
* Other less frequent reactions can occur.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Potassium citrate works by increasing the alkalinity of the urine.  It metabolizes to produce bicarbonate, which neutralizes acids in the body. This increased alkalinity helps to:

* **Increase urinary citrate levels:** Citrate inhibits the formation of calcium oxalate stones.
* **Increase urinary pH:**  This helps to dissolve uric acid stones and prevent the formation of calcium phosphate stones.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Potassium citrate is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to the drug, anuria (absence of urine production), severe renal impairment (GFR < 0.7 mL/kg/min), hyperkalemia, conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia, delayed gastric emptying, bowel obstruction, active urinary tract infection, peptic ulcer disease, or who are concurrently taking potassium-sparing diuretics.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potassium citrate should be used cautiously with certain medications, especially potassium-sparing diuretics. Concomitant use with anticholinergics is not recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of potassium citrate during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with cardiovascular disease, impaired kidney function, acid-base imbalances, and those taking digoxin should use potassium citrate with caution.  Adequate fluid intake is essential.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take potassium citrate with other medications?** A:  It's essential to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all the medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store potassium citrate?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What are the signs of hyperkalemia?** A:  Signs can include muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, and nausea.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect hyperkalemia.
* **Q: Can I crush or chew the tablets?** A:  Only follow your physician's explicit instructions for administration.  Typically extended-release tablets should not be crushed or chewed.
