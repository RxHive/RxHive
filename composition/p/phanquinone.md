# Phanquinone
### Generic Name
Phanquinone

### Usage
Phanquinone is an organic compound with a history of use in treating amebiasis (an infection caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*) and other protozoal diseases.  It was formerly used in combination with clioquinol, but this combination was discontinued due to the risk of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) associated with clioquinol.  Currently, medications like metronidazole and tinidazole are preferred for treating amebiasis.  Research is ongoing to explore the potential of phanquinone in treating Alzheimer's disease, based on its observed antioxidant properties.

### Dosage
There is no currently established standard dosage for phanquinone for human use due to its discontinuation in most applications.  Any potential dosage regimen for research purposes would be strictly determined and overseen by a medical professional within a controlled clinical trial setting.  Information regarding dosage should not be sourced from this information and only obtained through direct consultation with a physician or medical researcher.

### Side Effects
Because phanquinone is not currently used in standard medical practice, a comprehensive list of side effects is not readily available.  The past use in combination with clioquinol highlighted the serious risk of SMON, a neurological disorder.  Any potential side effects from phanquinone alone require further research and should be evaluated under strictly controlled clinical conditions.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action of phanquinone in treating amebiasis is not fully understood.  In the context of its potential use in Alzheimer's disease research, it is believed that phanquinone acts as an antioxidant.  Antioxidants help to neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, preventing damage to cells and potentially mitigating some of the effects of oxidative stress thought to contribute to Alzheimer's disease. This action, however, remains under investigation.

### Precautions
Due to the lack of current clinical use and the previously observed adverse effects related to its combination with clioquinol, significant precautions are necessary.  Phanquinone should not be used unless explicitly prescribed within a rigorously controlled clinical trial setting.  Information on potential drug interactions, contraindications, and safety measures in specific populations (pregnant women, children, elderly) are currently unavailable and require further research.  Given the potential neurotoxicity associated with similar compounds, caution is advised.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is phanquinone currently available as a prescription medication?**
    *A: No. Phanquinone is not currently approved or available for prescription use due to safety concerns and the availability of more effective treatments for amebiasis.  Its use is limited to research settings.*

* **Q: Can I buy phanquinone over-the-counter?**
    *A: No. Phanquinone is not available for over-the-counter purchase.*

* **Q: What are the risks associated with phanquinone?**
    *A:  The primary known risk is the potential for neurological side effects, particularly when combined with clioquinol, as seen with the occurrence of SMON. Further research is needed to fully delineate the safety profile of phanquinone when used alone.*

* **Q: Is phanquinone being studied for any other conditions?**
    *A:  Current research focuses primarily on exploring its potential as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease due to its antioxidant properties.*
