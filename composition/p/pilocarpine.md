# Pilocarpine

**Generic Name:** Pilocarpine

**Usage:**

Pilocarpine is used to treat a variety of conditions, primarily those related to insufficient tear production or increased intraocular pressure.  Its specific uses include:

* **Glaucoma:**  Pilocarpine eye drops are used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma, particularly open-angle glaucoma.  It works by constricting the pupil (miosis), which improves the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye, reducing pressure.
* **Dry Eye Disease (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca):** Pilocarpine eye drops can stimulate tear production in patients with dry eye.  This helps to lubricate the eyes and relieve symptoms like dryness, burning, and irritation.
* **Xerostomia (Dry Mouth):** Pilocarpine, sometimes in tablet form, can be used to stimulate saliva production in patients experiencing dry mouth due to certain medications (like those used in cancer treatment) or other medical conditions like Sjogren's syndrome.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the route of administration (eye drops vs. oral tablets) and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Eye Drops:**  Blurred vision, eye pain, headache, burning or stinging in the eyes, brow ache, eye redness, and increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).  Prolonged use can lead to cataracts and retinal detachment in some cases.
* **Oral Tablets:**  Excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, shortness of breath, and slow heart rate (bradycardia).  More severe side effects are possible and need immediate medical attention.

This is not an exhaustive list, and individuals may experience other side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist, meaning it mimics the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the parasympathetic nervous system.  In the eye, it primarily acts on muscarinic receptors, causing:

* **Miosis (pupil constriction):** This reduces the resistance to aqueous humor outflow, thus lowering IOP in glaucoma.
* **Increased Aqueous Humor Production (to a lesser extent):** While primarily affecting outflow, it also slightly increases the production of aqueous humor.
* **Increased Tear Production:** In the lacrimal glands, it stimulates the production of tears.
* **Increased Salivary Gland Secretion:**  Similarly, it increases saliva production in the salivary glands.


**FAQs:**

* **Is pilocarpine safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to the fetus and infant.
* **Can pilocarpine be used with other medications?**  Interactions with other medications are possible, so inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of pilocarpine eye drops are usually seen within minutes, while the effects of oral tablets may take longer.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Follow your doctor's instructions regarding missed doses.  Generally, do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Can pilocarpine cause allergic reactions?**  Yes, allergic reactions are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.
