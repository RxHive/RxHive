# Pitavastatin

**Generic Name:** Pitavastatin Calcium

**Usage:**

Pitavastatin is used to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides in the blood.  It's prescribed to adults with high cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) or mixed dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides) who need additional help lowering their cholesterol even after making diet and lifestyle changes.  It's often used in conjunction with diet and exercise.  Specifically, it may be used:

*   As monotherapy (alone) in patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond adequately to statins other than pitavastatin.
*   In combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications, such as bile acid sequestrants,  for more significant reductions in LDL cholesterol.
*   To reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke in patients with high cholesterol and risk factors for heart disease.


**Side Effects:**

Pitavastatin, like other statins, generally has mild side effects, but some can be serious.  Common side effects include:

*   Muscle aches and pains (myalgia) – this is the most common side effect and can range from mild discomfort to severe muscle pain (myopathy).  In rare cases, it can lead to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), a serious condition.
*   Headache
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Constipation
*   Abdominal pain
*   Fatigue
*   Dizziness

Less common but more serious side effects include:

*   Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) – liver function tests are usually monitored during treatment.
*   Elevated blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia)
*   Type 2 diabetes (in some individuals)
*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
*   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)


**How it Works:**

Pitavastatin belongs to a class of drugs called statins. It works by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which is crucial in the liver's production of cholesterol. By inhibiting this enzyme, pitavastatin reduces the liver's production of cholesterol, leading to lower LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.  It also increases the number of LDL receptors in the liver, further enhancing the removal of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is pitavastatin better than other statins?** A:  Pitavastatin is generally considered to be well-tolerated and has a lower incidence of muscle-related side effects compared to some other statins. However, the best statin for a particular individual depends on various factors, including their medical history, other medications they are taking, and their response to treatment. A doctor should determine the most appropriate statin.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking pitavastatin?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of liver damage. It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience muscle pain?** A:  Muscle pain is a common side effect.  If the pain is mild, it may resolve on its own. However, if the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms (e.g., weakness, dark urine), contact your doctor immediately.

* **Q:  What are the dietary considerations while on pitavastatin?** A:  Maintaining a healthy, low-cholesterol diet is crucial for optimal results.  Your doctor or a registered dietitian can advise you on the appropriate diet plan.

* **Q: Can I stop taking pitavastatin on my own?** A: No, never stop taking pitavastatin without first consulting your doctor.  Suddenly stopping the medication can lead to a rebound increase in cholesterol levels.
