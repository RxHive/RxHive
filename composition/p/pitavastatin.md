# Pitavastatin
### Generic Name
Pitavastatin

### Usage

Pitavastatin is primarily used to lower high cholesterol levels in adults and children aged 8 years and older.  It's an add-on to a healthy diet and lifestyle changes. Specifically, it reduces levels of total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (a protein associated with LDL), and triglycerides (another type of fat in the blood).  It also helps raise HDL ("good") cholesterol levels.  Pitavastatin is used to treat primary hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol with no known cause) and mixed dyslipidemia (a combination of high and low cholesterol levels).  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used off-label to help prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals, but this requires careful discussion with a doctor.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  The starting dose is usually 2 mg once daily.  Your doctor will adjust the dose based on your cholesterol levels and response to treatment, up to a maximum of 4 mg daily.  The dose may be adjusted every 4 weeks after starting or changing the dose, depending on blood tests.

**Children (aged 8 and older):**  The starting dose is 2 mg once daily.  Dosage adjustments are made based on individual responses, with a maximum dose of 4 mg daily.  Blood tests are crucial for monitoring cholesterol levels and adjusting dosage as needed.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with kidney or liver problems.  People with severe liver disease shouldn't take Pitavastatin. The dosage should be adjusted in individuals with decreased kidney function. Consult your doctor for specific recommendations in these situations.

**Important Note:** Pitavastatin is available in different salt forms (calcium and magnesium), but the dose is always given in milligrams of pitavastatin base.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of users):**

* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Back pain
* Muscle pain (myalgia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Muscle weakness or pain (myopathy)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Increased blood sugar levels
* Cognitive impairment (memory problems, confusion)

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine, stop taking Pitavastatin and contact your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Pitavastatin is a statin medication. It works by blocking an enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) in the liver that's essential for producing cholesterol. By inhibiting this enzyme, Pitavastatin lowers the liver's cholesterol production. This also leads to the liver absorbing more cholesterol from the bloodstream, effectively reducing the overall cholesterol levels in your body.  Beyond this primary effect, statins like Pitavastatin also have other beneficial effects on blood vessels and the cardiovascular system.


### Precautions

* **Liver Disease:** Pitavastatin is contraindicated in people with active liver disease or unexplained elevated liver enzymes.  Regular liver function tests are essential during treatment.
* **Kidney Disease:** Dose adjustment is necessary for individuals with reduced kidney function.
* **Muscle Problems:**  Pitavastatin can, rarely, cause muscle damage (myopathy or rhabdomyolysis).  This risk increases with other medications that can affect muscles.  It is crucial to report any muscle pain, weakness, or tenderness immediately.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pitavastatin is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it's contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Effective contraception is crucial during treatment for women of childbearing age.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pitavastatin interacts with several medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  Some specific interactions to be aware of involve medications like erythromycin, rifampicin, gemfibrozil, colchicine, and cyclosporine.
* **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption may increase the risk of liver damage.
