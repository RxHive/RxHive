# Proglumetacin
### Generic Name
Proglumetacin

### Usage
Proglumetacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders.  This includes conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other forms of inflammatory joint disease.  It's also used to manage pain and inflammation from traumatic and non-traumatic soft tissue injuries such as tendinitis, tenosynovitis, bursitis, lower back pain (lumbalgia), stiff neck, and sprains.  The specific formulation (capsule, tablet, suppository, or cream) will influence the most appropriate application.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Proglumetacin should always be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient factors and response to treatment.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Oral:** For musculoskeletal and joint pain/inflammation, capsules may be prescribed at 150 mg twice or three times daily. Tablets, at a dose of 300 mg once or twice daily, might be used for 3-10 days as needed.
* **Rectal:** For musculoskeletal and joint pain/inflammation, suppositories of 200 mg can be administered twice daily for 3-10 days as needed. For chronic rheumatic diseases, a dose of 200 mg once or twice daily may be prescribed as needed.
* **Topical:** For traumatic and non-traumatic painful soft tissue disorders, a 5% cream can be applied to the affected area twice or three times daily.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Proglumetacin in children have not been established, and its use is contraindicated in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Lower doses might be necessary for patients with severe hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Consult your physician for guidance on dose adjustments based on your individual health status.


### Side Effects

Proglumetacin, like other NSAIDs, can cause various side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Common:** Headache, dizziness, fatigue, heartburn, epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia (loss of appetite), dry mouth.  Skin rash and itching are also possible.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Heart failure, elevation of liver enzymes, hepatic dysfunction (liver problems), nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), renal dysfunction (kidney problems), hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), sepsis (a life-threatening infection), diabetes mellitus (newly diagnosed or worsening diabetes).


### How it Works

Proglumetacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from indoleacetic acid.  It works by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is responsible for producing prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, Proglumetacin helps decrease inflammation and alleviate pain.  It may also inhibit other inflammatory mediators like bradykinin and leukotrienes.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Proglumetacin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to it, those with a history of allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs (such as rhinitis, urticaria, or asthma), individuals with active gastric or duodenal ulcers, those with active gastrointestinal bleeding, those with a recent history of proctitis (rectal inflammation â€“ for suppository use only), and pregnant women in their third trimester. It's also contraindicated in children.
* **Increased Risk:** Use with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, or perforation; hepatic, renal, or cardiac dysfunction.  Increased risk of gastrointestinal effects, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), hypersensitivity reactions, nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), and central nervous system (CNS) effects (headache, dizziness, fatigue) are possible.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with ACE inhibitors may increase the risk of renal impairment and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). Alcohol increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Concomitant use with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants elevates the bleeding risk.  Co-administration with beta-blockers may affect blood pressure control. Using Proglumetacin with other NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Proglumetacin is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy. It may be excreted in breast milk, so its use during breastfeeding should be avoided.  It's categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully known.
