# Propiverine
### Generic Name
Propiverine

### Usage
Propiverine is primarily used to treat urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence.  These symptoms often stem from an overactive bladder, a condition where the bladder muscles contract involuntarily, leading to a frequent and urgent need to urinate.  It's also used in cases of neurogenic bladder, where nerve damage affects bladder control.  While its main application is in managing bladder symptoms, it's crucial to remember that it addresses the symptoms and not the underlying cause.  Therefore, identifying and treating the root cause of overactive bladder remains essential.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Immediate-release tablets:**  The usual dose is 15 mg taken 1-3 times daily, or 20 mg taken 1-2 times daily. The maximum daily dose is 45 mg.
* **Modified-release capsules:** The starting dose is 30 mg once daily. This can be increased to a maximum of 45 mg once daily.

**Children and Adolescents:**  Modified-release capsules are not suitable for children.  For children with overactive bladder, the dosage of immediate-release tablets is determined based on weight:


* **General Dosing (mg/kg/day in two divided doses):** 0.8 mg/kg/day
* **Weight-adjusted dosing (immediate-release tablets):**
    * 12-16 kg: 5 mg twice daily
    * 17-22 kg: 5 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening
    * 23-28 kg: 10 mg twice daily
    * 29-34 kg: 10 mg in the morning and 15 mg in the evening
    * â‰¥35 kg: 15 mg twice daily (maximum 30 mg/day)


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild impairment, but use with caution.  It's contraindicated in moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate impairment, but use with caution. For severe impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the maximum daily dose is 30 mg.
* **Coadministration with potent CYP3A4/5 and FMO inhibitors:** When co-administered with potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (like some antifungals) and potent FMO inhibitors (like methimazole), start with a lower dose (15mg/day) and titrate cautiously.


**Administration:** Immediate-release tablets should be taken at least one hour before meals, especially in patients with renal or mild hepatic impairment. Modified-release capsules can be taken without regard to meals, but should not be crushed or chewed.

Less common but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Propiverine works in two ways: it inhibits calcium influx into urinary bladder smooth muscle cells, leading to muscle relaxation (musculotropic spasmolysis), and it also inhibits nerve signals that trigger bladder contractions (anticholinergic action). This dual mechanism helps reduce the involuntary contractions of the bladder muscles, thus alleviating symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Propiverine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, uncontrolled angle-closure glaucoma, significant bladder outflow obstruction, rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or congenital lactase deficiency, children with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency, bowel obstruction, myasthenia gravis, intestinal atony, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon, uncontrolled angle-closure glaucoma, tachyarrhythmia, and moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.

**Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, glaucoma, mild hepatic impairment, hiatal hernia with reflux esophagitis, autonomic neuropathy, prostatic hyperplasia, urinary stricture, and renal impairment.  Increased risk of severe congestive heart failure exacerbation, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, hiatus hernia with reflux oesophagitis, and prostatic hyperplasia may exist. CNS effects are also possible.


**Drug Interactions:** Propiverine may interact with various medications.  Specifically, it can: reduce blood pressure when used with isoniazid; enhance drowsiness when combined with CNS depressants; decrease the effect of prokinetics; have its effects decreased by cholinergic drugs; and have its effects increased by tricyclic antidepressants, tranquilizers, other anticholinergics, amantadine, neuroleptics, and beta-adrenoceptor agonists.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Propiverine is not recommended during pregnancy.  Because excretion in breast milk is unknown, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive after taking Propiverine?**  A: Drowsiness is a possible side effect. Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience dizziness or drowsiness.

* **Q: How should I store Propiverine?** A:  Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
