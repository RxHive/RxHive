# Prussian Blue
### Generic Name
Prussian Blue

### Usage
Prussian blue is primarily used as an antidote for internal radioactive cesium and thallium contamination.  It works by binding to these radioactive isotopes in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream and promoting their elimination from the body through feces.  This reduces the overall radiation exposure and the associated health risks.  It's crucial to understand that Prussian blue *does not* treat the effects of radiation already absorbed by the body; it focuses solely on minimizing further absorption.

### Dosage

**Cesium/Thallium Contamination:**

* **Adults:** The typical oral dosage is 3 grams three times a day (tid). The maximum daily dose is 9 grams.
* **Children:** For children 12 years old and younger, the oral dose is 1 gram tid, with a maximum daily dose of 3 grams.  Children older than 12 years receive the adult dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

The safety and efficacy of Prussian blue in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment haven't been established.  It may be less effective in individuals with liver problems.

### Side Effects

* **Common (>10%):** Gastrointestinal distress (such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), constipation.
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Asymptomatic hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood).  This usually doesn't cause symptoms but should be monitored.


**Serious Side Effects:** While less common, increased absorption of radiation in the gastrointestinal tract, electrolyte imbalances (beyond hypokalemia), and blue discoloration of bodily fluids (mouth, teeth, feces, saliva, sweat) can occur.  Consult a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works

Prussian blue is a complex iron cyanide compound.  After ingestion, it binds to cesium and thallium ions in the gastrointestinal tract.  This binding prevents the radioactive isotopes from being absorbed into the bloodstream. The bound cesium and thallium are then eliminated from the body through the feces.  This mechanism effectively reduces the overall body burden of these radioactive elements, lessening the harmful effects of radiation exposure.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  A relative contraindication exists for individuals with hypersensitivity to Prussian blue or any of its components.  There are no absolute contraindications explicitly listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) or electrolyte imbalances.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Prussian blue is classified as Category C for pregnancy. This means that potential benefits might outweigh risks in some cases, but it should only be used if clearly needed.  Excretion into breast milk is unknown; hence, caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  The drug can cause constipation, and patients should maintain adequate hydration and be advised on promoting regular bowel movements.  The harmless blue discoloration of bodily fluids should be explained to the patient beforehand.  If swallowing large numbers of capsules proves difficult, the contents can be mixed with bland food or liquids.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long is the treatment typically needed?** A: Treatment duration depends on the individual and the level of contamination. It may last for 30 days or longer, guided by regular monitoring of cesium/thallium elimination rates in urine and feces.

* **Q:  Does Prussian blue treat radiation sickness?** A: No, Prussian blue only helps to reduce the absorption of radioactive cesium and thallium. It doesn't treat the effects of radiation already absorbed into the body. Supportive care for radiation toxicity is essential alongside Prussian blue treatment.

* **Q: What if I can't swallow the capsules?** A:  The contents of the capsules can be mixed with bland food or liquids to aid ingestion.

* **Q:  Is the blue discoloration harmful?** A: No, the blue discoloration of the mouth, teeth, feces, saliva, and sweat is a harmless side effect of the medication.

* **Q:  Should I take this medication with food?** A: Yes, it's recommended to take Prussian blue with food.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects, especially severe gastrointestinal issues or signs of electrolyte imbalance.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.  The specific dosage and treatment approach should be determined by a qualified physician based on the individual's situation and severity of contamination.
