# Propylthiouracil
### Generic Name
Propylthiouracil

### Usage
Propylthiouracil is an antithyroid medication primarily used to treat hyperthyroidism.  This means it's used to manage an overactive thyroid gland that produces too much thyroid hormone.  The primary conditions it addresses are Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter.  It's typically prescribed for individuals who can't tolerate methimazole (another antithyroid drug) or for whom surgery or radioactive iodine therapy isn't a suitable option.  Propylthiouracil can also be used to control hyperthyroid symptoms before a thyroidectomy (surgical removal of the thyroid) or radioactive iodine therapy, again, particularly in patients intolerant to methimazole.  It's important to note that its use in thyroid storm (a life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism) is considered off-label.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and individual response.  A physician will determine the appropriate dose.

* **Hyperthyroidism:**  Initial doses typically range from 300-450 mg daily, divided into three doses taken approximately 8 hours apart.  This may need to be increased to 600-900 mg/day in some cases.  The maintenance dose is usually lower, around 100-150 mg/day, divided into three doses.

* **Graves' Disease:** The initial dose is often 50-150 mg three times daily. The maintenance dose is usually 50 mg twice or three times daily for 12-18 months, after which it's gradually reduced and potentially discontinued if the thyroid hormone levels normalize.

* **Thyrotoxic Crisis (Thyroid Storm):** This is an emergency situation requiring immediate medical attention. Initial doses are much higher, often 200-300 mg every 4-6 hours on the first day, potentially reaching 800-1200 mg/day. Doses are then gradually reduced.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage is calculated based on the child's weight and age and should only be determined and supervised by a pediatrician.  Generally, initial doses are lower than in adults, with adjustments made based on the child's response to treatment.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. A physician must carefully consider the individual's health status in these cases.


### Side Effects

Propylthiouracil, like all medications, can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, headache, drowsiness, skin rash, itching.
* **Serious (but less common):** Liver damage (including acute liver failure), kidney problems, bone marrow suppression (leading to decreased blood cell counts), allergic reactions (potentially severe), agranulocytosis (a dangerous decrease in white blood cells), hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).  Some serious dermatological reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are possible, though rare.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Propylthiouracil works by interfering with the thyroid gland's ability to produce thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). It does this by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which is crucial for the synthesis of these hormones.  It also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, further reducing the levels of active thyroid hormone in the body.  By lowering the amount of thyroid hormone, it helps to manage the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Propylthiouracil is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to propylthiouracil or any of its components.

* **Interactions:**  Propylthiouracil can interact with other medications, particularly anticoagulants (blood thinners), potentially increasing their effects.  Concomitant use with these should be avoided or carefully monitored.

* **Warnings:**  Propylthiouracil carries a boxed warning regarding severe liver injury and acute liver failure, which can be fatal.  Regular monitoring of liver function is crucial.  There's also a risk of agranulocytosis, bone marrow suppression, and other serious side effects.  Special caution is necessary in pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and children.  The lowest effective dose should always be used, especially during pregnancy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take propylthiouracil?** A:  Treatment duration varies depending on your condition and response. Your doctor will determine the appropriate length of treatment.

* **Q: Can I take propylthiouracil with other medications?** A:  It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some may interact negatively with propylthiouracil.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store propylthiouracil?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A:  Signs include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, hives, and severe itching. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
