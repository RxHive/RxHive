# Pseudoephedrine + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate
### Generic Name
Pseudoephedrine + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It's a multi-symptom formulation addressing several common complaints simultaneously.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** This is a decongestant, meaning it shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and congestion. It works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels.

* **Bromhexine:** This is an expectorant. It helps to loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up phlegm. This helps clear congestion in the lungs and bronchi. It achieves this by reducing the viscosity of mucus.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine. It helps to reduce the symptoms of allergies, such as runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body in response to allergens.

Therefore, the combined effect tackles congestion (nasal and chest), reduces the production of mucus, and alleviates allergy-like symptoms often accompanying respiratory infections.  It is primarily used for symptomatic relief and does not cure the underlying infection.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be as directed by a physician or pharmacist.  Self-medication should be avoided.  The specific dosage will vary depending on the product formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of symptoms.  It's crucial to carefully read the label and follow instructions precisely.  There is no standardized dosage as formulations vary significantly.  **Oral administration is standard.**  Intravenous (IV) administration is not applicable for this combination drug.  

**General information, not a substitute for professional advice:**  Adult dosages generally involve taking one or two tablets or a specific volume of syrup several times a day, with a gap of several hours between doses.  Children's dosages are significantly lower and strictly age and weight-dependent.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.


### Side Effects

Common Side Effects:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness

Less Common but Serious Side Effects:

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

As explained under "Usage," each component of the medication works independently to target different aspects of respiratory symptoms.  Pseudoephedrine constricts blood vessels, reducing nasal congestion.  Bromhexine thins mucus, making expectoration easier.  Chlorpheniramine blocks histamine receptors, mitigating allergy symptoms.  The combined action provides broader symptomatic relief compared to using any single component alone.


### Precautions

* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:** Consult a doctor before use.
* **People with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, glaucoma, enlarged prostate, or thyroid problems:**  This medication may worsen these conditions; use should be carefully considered and supervised by a medical professional.
* **Interactions with other drugs:** This combination may interact with certain medications, particularly other decongestants, MAO inhibitors, or antidepressants.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Avoid alcohol:** Alcohol can exacerbate side effects, especially drowsiness.
* **Driving or operating machinery:** Drowsiness is a potential side effect; avoid activities requiring alertness if affected.
* **Children:**  Use only as directed by a pediatrician and strictly follow the prescribed dosage.
* **Older adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.


### FAQs
