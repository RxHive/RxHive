# Pseudoephedrine + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Pseudoephedrine + Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Specifically, it addresses:

* **Nasal congestion:** Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Cough:** Bromhexine is an expectorant that helps to loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, and watery eyes (allergic symptoms):** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

It's important to note that this combination is often used for symptomatic relief and does not treat the underlying cause of the infection.  A doctor should be consulted for diagnosis and treatment.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Pseudoephedrine related:**  Increased heart rate, nervousness, dizziness, insomnia, headache, high blood pressure, difficulty urinating.
* **Bromhexine related:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset.
* **Chlorpheniramine related:**  Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness.

More serious, though less common, side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), fast or irregular heartbeat, and seizures.


**How it Works:**

* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Acts as a sympathomimetic amine, stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and reducing nasal congestion.
* **Bromhexine:**  Reduces the viscosity (thickness) of mucus by altering the structure of mucopolysaccharides. This makes it easier to expectorate (cough up) the mucus.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks the action of histamine at H1-receptors, reducing allergic symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of chlorpheniramine, leading to increased drowsiness.  It's best to avoid alcohol while using this combination.
