# Proanthocyanidin

It's impossible to provide details about a "generic Proanthocyanidin" because proanthocyanidins are not a single, generic substance.  Proanthocyanidins (also known as condensed tannins) are a large and diverse group of oligomeric and polymeric flavan-3-ol compounds found in many plants.  Their chemical structure varies greatly depending on the plant source.  This means there's no single "generic" proanthocyanidin with a uniform usage, side effect profile, or mechanism of action.

To illustrate, proanthocyanidins from grape seeds will have a different composition and effects than those from cranberry, pine bark, or cocoa.  Therefore, providing a single profile is misleading and inaccurate.

Instead of a generic profile, information should be sought on *specific* proanthocyanidin extracts, always specifying the plant source and ideally, the standardized extract composition (e.g.,  "Grape Seed Proanthocyanidin Extract standardized to 95% proanthocyanidins").  Only then can accurate information about usage, side effects, and mechanism be provided.


If you have a specific proanthocyanidin extract in mind (e.g., PycnogenolÂ® which is a specific pine bark extract rich in proanthocyanidins), please provide the name, and I can try to give you information based on that specific product.
