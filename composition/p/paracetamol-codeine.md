# Paracetamol + Codeine

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol/Codeine

**Usage:**

Paracetamol/Codeine is a combination medicine used to relieve moderate to severe pain.  The paracetamol reduces fever and provides mild pain relief, while the codeine is an opioid that offers stronger pain relief.  It's commonly used for headaches, muscle aches, back pain, toothaches, menstrual cramps, and post-surgical pain.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor or pharmacist based on the individual's needs and health condition.  It's crucial to use it only as directed and for the prescribed duration.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very common side effect due to the codeine's action on the digestive system.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These can occur, especially with higher doses.
* **Drowsiness and dizziness:** Codeine can cause significant drowsiness, affecting alertness and coordination.  Driving or operating machinery should be avoided.
* **Headache:**  This can be a paradoxical effect, meaning it can sometimes worsen the condition it's intended to treat.
* **Lightheadedness:** Feeling faint or unsteady.
* **Sweating:** Increased perspiration.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
* **Respiratory depression:**  Slowed or shallow breathing, a serious and potentially life-threatening side effect.
* **Dependence and addiction:** Prolonged use can lead to physical and psychological dependence.
* **Seizures:** In rare cases, particularly with high doses or pre-existing conditions.
* **Liver damage:**  High doses of paracetamol can damage the liver.


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by reducing the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, which are substances that cause pain and fever.
* **Codeine:**  This is an opioid analgesic.  It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, altering the perception of pain and reducing pain signals.  Codeine is converted in the liver to morphine, its active metabolite, which contributes to its pain-relieving effects.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?** The onset of pain relief typically occurs within 30-60 minutes.
* **How long can I take it for?**  Do not take this medication for longer than recommended by your doctor. Prolonged use can lead to dependence.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking it?** No, alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the risk of liver damage from the paracetamol and enhance the sedative effects of the codeine.
* **Can I take it with other medications?**  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, to avoid potential interactions.  Certain medications can interact dangerously with paracetamol/codeine.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  Take the next dose as scheduled.
* **What should I do if I overdose?** Seek immediate medical attention. Overdose can lead to serious complications, including liver damage and respiratory depression.
