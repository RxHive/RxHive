# Propyl Thiouracil
### Generic Name
Propylthiouracil (PTU)

### Usage
Propylthiouracil is a medication primarily used to treat hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones.  This overproduction leads to symptoms like rapid heartbeat, weight loss, nervousness, and heat intolerance. PTU works by interfering with the production of these hormones in the thyroid gland.  While its primary use is in hyperthyroidism, it may also be used to prepare patients for thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine therapy by reducing the thyroid's activity beforehand.  It's less commonly used now compared to methimazole due to a higher risk of liver damage, but it remains an option for certain patients.


### Dosage
Dosage of propylthiouracil varies greatly depending on the individual's age, weight, severity of hyperthyroidism, and response to treatment.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage.  It's crucial to follow their instructions precisely.  

* **Adults (Oral):** Initial doses typically range from 100 to 150 mg three or four times daily.  The dosage is adjusted based on the patient's response and thyroid function test results.  Maintenance doses are typically lower.

* **Children (Oral):** Dosage for children is determined by weight and the severity of the condition.  A physician will calculate the appropriate dose, usually divided throughout the day.

* **IV Administration:** Intravenous administration of propylthiouracil is rarely used, and only in specific situations under strict medical supervision in a hospital setting. The dosage in such cases will be determined by a physician based on the individual's needs.


Different forms of PTU include tablets.  It's essential to take the medication as directed and not crush or chew tablets unless specifically instructed by the doctor.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  These include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, rash, loss of taste, and itching.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  More serious, though less common, side effects include liver damage (hepatitis), bone marrow suppression (leading to decreased white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets), and allergic reactions (including a rare but potentially fatal condition called agranulocytosis, characterized by a severe lack of white blood cells).  

* **Important Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, particularly signs of liver damage (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain), bone marrow suppression (easy bruising, bleeding, fatigue, fever), or allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Propylthiouracil works by interfering with the process of thyroid hormone synthesis.  Specifically, it inhibits the enzymes necessary for the thyroid gland to convert iodide into thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)).  By blocking this conversion, PTU reduces the amount of circulating thyroid hormones, thereby alleviating the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** PTU is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to the drug.

* **Drug Interactions:**  PTU can interact with several other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), and some medications used for heart conditions.  It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  PTU can cross the placenta and is secreted in breast milk.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits against potential risks to the mother and child.  Methimazole is generally preferred in pregnancy due to a lower risk of liver problems.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly liver damage. Careful monitoring is necessary.

* **Liver Function Tests:** Regular liver function tests are recommended during PTU treatment to monitor for potential liver damage.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take PTU?**  A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual's condition and response to therapy. It can range from several months to several years.

* **Q: Can I stop taking PTU suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping PTU can lead to a sudden worsening of hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm), a life-threatening condition.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding tapering off the medication.

* **Q: How should I store PTU?** A: Store PTU tablets in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and keep them out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Are there any alternatives to PTU?** A: Yes, Methimazole is another commonly used antithyroid medication.  Your doctor can help determine the best option for you.
