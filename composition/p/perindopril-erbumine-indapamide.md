# Perindopril erbumine + Indapamide
### Generic Name
Perindopril erbumine + Indapamide

### Usage

Perindopril erbumine + Indapamide is a combination medication used primarily to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by combining two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: an ACE inhibitor (perindopril erbumine) and a thiazide diuretic (indapamide).  This combination is often more effective than either drug alone in controlling blood pressure.  While its primary use is hypertension, it may sometimes be considered for patients with heart failure, particularly those with hypertension as a contributing factor.  However, the use in heart failure is usually determined on a case-by-case basis by a cardiologist.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication for any condition.

### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  There isn't a universally applicable dosage for children as this combination is generally not used in pediatric populations.  The following is for informational purposes only and should not be taken as medical advice.

**Adults (Oral):**  The usual starting dose is one tablet of the combination daily, often taken in the morning.  The doctor may adjust the dose based on blood pressure readings and individual response.  Higher doses may be prescribed, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision.

**Children (Oral):** This combination is generally not recommended for children.

**IV Administration:** This medication is not administered intravenously. It's strictly for oral use.

**Different Forms:** This medication is typically available as a fixed-dose combination tablet.  There are different strengths of tablets available, and the doctor will prescribe the appropriate strength.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients) may include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dry cough (a characteristic side effect of ACE inhibitors)
* Nausea
* Muscle cramps
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)

Less common but more serious side effects (though still relatively rare) might include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat – seek immediate medical attention if this occurs)
*  Kidney problems
*  Changes in blood potassium levels
*  Increased sensitivity to sunlight
*  Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Perindopril erbumine, an ACE inhibitor, works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).  ACE plays a role in raising blood pressure by constricting blood vessels.  By inhibiting ACE, perindopril helps relax blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.  Indapamide, a thiazide diuretic, increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys.  This reduces blood volume, which in turn lowers blood pressure. The combined effect of these two mechanisms provides a more potent and controlled lowering of blood pressure than either drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitors, severe kidney impairment, severe liver impairment, or hypersensitivity to either perindopril or indapamide or any of their components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Many drugs can interact with this medication, including potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and lithium.  It’s crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters.  It's also generally not recommended during breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor regarding the risks and benefits.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medication and require lower doses or closer monitoring.

* **Patients with Kidney or Liver Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is often necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  It's best to limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication, as alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound effect in blood pressure.

* **Q:  What if I experience a severe side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience serious side effects, such as angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), difficulty breathing, or severe dizziness.
