# Perindopril erbumine + Indapamide

**Generic Name:** Perindopril erbumine + Indapamide

**Usage:**

This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It contains two different medications: perindopril erbumine (an ACE inhibitor) and indapamide (a diuretic).  Perindopril helps relax blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow. Indapamide helps your body get rid of excess salt and water, which also lowers blood pressure.  This combination is often prescribed when a single medication isn't enough to control blood pressure effectively.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects can include:

* **From Perindopril:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, dry cough (a persistent dry cough is a reason to contact your doctor), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, changes in taste, muscle cramps, and rarely, angioedema (a serious allergic reaction that causes swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs).

* **From Indapamide:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, muscle cramps, increased urination, thirst, low potassium levels (hypokalemia), and photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).

* **Both Medications:**  Low blood pressure (hypotension), especially when first starting the medication or increasing the dose.

Serious but less common side effects may also occur. It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately. This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication leaflet for a complete list of potential side effects.


**How it Works:**

Perindopril erbumine inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is responsible for producing angiotensin II, a substance that narrows blood vessels. By blocking ACE, perindopril reduces the production of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and a decrease in blood pressure.

Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic. It increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body via the kidneys. This reduces the volume of blood circulating in the body, lowering blood pressure.  The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more potent and effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so combining it with this medication could lead to excessive blood pressure drops.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Can I take this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Generally, this medication is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Consult your doctor immediately if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  No, you should never stop taking this medication abruptly.  Stopping suddenly can cause a rebound effect, leading to a sudden increase in blood pressure. Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose before you stop taking the medication completely.

* **What are the potential drug interactions?** This medication can interact with other drugs, including other blood pressure medications, potassium supplements, lithium, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
