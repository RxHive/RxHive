# Pancreatin + Simethicone
### Generic Name
Pancreatin + Simethicone

### Usage
Pancreatin + Simethicone is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms associated with insufficient pancreatic enzyme production and excessive gas.  Pancreatin, the primary active ingredient, contains enzymes (amylase, lipase, and protease) naturally produced by the pancreas. These enzymes aid in the digestion of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.  A deficiency in these enzymes, often due to conditions like pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis, can lead to digestive problems such as bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Simethicone, the second active ingredient, is an antiflatulent that helps reduce gas and bloating by breaking up gas bubbles in the digestive tract.  Therefore, this combination medication is primarily used to treat symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency and to alleviate gas-related discomfort that often accompanies digestive enzyme deficiency.  It may be used as part of a broader treatment plan for conditions like cystic fibrosis.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose.  It's crucial to follow their specific instructions.  Generally, the medication is administered orally with meals.

* **Adults:** Dosage typically ranges from one to several capsules or tablets per meal, based on the severity of symptoms and physician recommendation. The exact amount of pancreatin and simethicone will be specified on the prescription.
* **Children:** Dosage for children is strictly determined by a physician based on age, weight, and specific needs.  It is usually given in a form suitable for children, such as a chewable tablet or a liquid suspension.  Never administer adult-strength medication to a child.
* **IV Administration:** Pancreatin + Simethicone is not administered intravenously (IV).  It is always given orally.

**Important Note:** Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist. Do not alter the dosage without consulting a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Pancreatin + Simethicone can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramping or discomfort
* Constipation (less common)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Fibrosis (scarring) in the liver or lungs (rare but a serious long-term complication of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy â€“ the risk is usually minimized by using appropriate doses and monitoring).
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels in the blood)

If you experience any unusual or severe side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Pancreatin supplements the body's natural pancreatic enzyme production, helping to break down food more effectively. This improves digestion and reduces symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea associated with pancreatic insufficiency.  Simethicone works by reducing gas and bloating. It alters the surface tension of gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing them to coalesce into larger bubbles, which are then easier to expel.  The combined action of pancreatin and simethicone alleviates both enzyme deficiency symptoms and gas-related discomfort.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergies to any of its components (pancreatin, simethicone, or other inactive ingredients).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Some interactions are possible, though not commonly reported.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The safety of this medication in pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been extensively studied.

* **Other Precautions:** Swallow capsules or tablets whole with plenty of water. Do not crush or chew the tablets unless specifically instructed by your physician.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.
