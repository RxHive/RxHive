# Pemetrexed

**Generic Name:** Pemetrexed

**Usage:** Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy medication used to treat several types of cancer, including:

* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):**  Often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs or immunotherapy.  Specifically, it's used in patients with metastatic NSCLC (cancer that has spread) and sometimes in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.
* **Mesothelioma:** A cancer of the lining of the lungs and other organs.  It is often used in combination with other treatments.
* **Breast cancer:** In some cases, it might be used in combination with other treatments for certain types of metastatic breast cancer.
* **Other cancers:**  It's being investigated in clinical trials for other types of cancer.

**Note:** The specific usage and dosage of pemetrexed will depend on the type and stage of cancer, the patient's overall health, and other factors.  A physician will determine the appropriate course of treatment.

**Side Effects:** Pemetrexed can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some rare.  The severity can vary from person to person.  Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Often manageable with anti-nausea medications.
* **Diarrhea:**  May require medication to control.
* **Decreased appetite:** Leading to weight loss.
* **Mouth sores (stomatitis):** Can make eating and drinking difficult.
* **Low blood counts:**  (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) increasing the risk of infection, bleeding, and fatigue.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  Indicating possible liver damage.
* **Kidney problems:** Including decreased kidney function.
* **Rash or skin reactions:**  May be mild or severe.
* **Hair loss (alopecia):** Often temporary.
* **Cough and shortness of breath:** Especially relevant for lung cancer patients.

**Serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention. These can include:**

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Such as anaphylaxis.
* **Severe infections:** Due to low white blood cell count.
* **Severe bleeding:** Due to low platelet count.
* **Kidney failure:**  Requires close monitoring of kidney function.
* **Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis:** Inflammation of the lungs, potentially life-threatening.


**How it Works:** Pemetrexed is an antimetabolite.  It works by interfering with the synthesis of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) that are essential for cell growth and replication.  Cancer cells are rapidly dividing, making them particularly susceptible to the effects of pemetrexed.  It inhibits several enzymes involved in folate metabolism, effectively starving the cancer cells of the building blocks they need to grow.

**FAQs:**
