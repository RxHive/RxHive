# Pemetrexed
### Generic Name
Pemetrexed

### Usage

Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy medication classified as an antifolate antineoplastic agent.  Its primary use is in the treatment of certain cancers.  Specifically, it's used in combination with cisplatin for treating malignant pleural mesothelioma (a cancer of the lining of the lungs) in adults whose tumors are unresectable (cannot be surgically removed) or who aren't suitable candidates for potentially curative surgery.  Pemetrexed is also used as a single agent (monotherapy) for treating locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after other chemotherapy treatments have been tried.  It's important to note that  Pemetrexed is sometimes used off-label (meaning not officially approved for that use) in treating other cancers like bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, thymic malignancies, and cervical cancer.  However, the efficacy and safety in these off-label uses should be carefully considered with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Pemetrexed dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors including the type of cancer being treated, the patient's overall health, and other medications they are taking.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and administration instructions precisely as directed by a physician or qualified healthcare professional.

**Adult Dosage:** The typical dose is 500 mg/mÂ² administered intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes.  The frequency of administration varies depending on the treatment regimen and the cancer type.  For malignant pleural mesothelioma, it is often given on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, usually in combination with cisplatin. For NSCLC, the regimen can vary depending on whether it's a first-line, maintenance, or second-line treatment, and if used in combination with other drugs like pembrolizumab.  The specific schedule and duration of treatment should be determined by an oncologist.  Before beginning treatment with Pemetrexed, patients usually receive folic acid (400-1000 mcg daily orally) starting 7 days prior to the first dose and continuing throughout treatment, and vitamin B12 (1000 mcg IM) 7 days before treatment initiation.  Dexamethasone may also be given to reduce side effects. Dosage adjustments are often necessary based on factors such as renal and hepatic function, and the occurrence of side effects.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Pemetrexed have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are frequently required based on several factors, including renal function (creatinine clearance), liver function (serum transaminases), and the development of side effects (hematologic or non-hematologic toxicities).  Specific guidelines exist for adjusting the dose based on these factors, and these adjustments must be carefully managed by an oncologist.  Obese patients may require adjustments in their dosage calculations, often based on actual body weight.

### Side Effects

Pemetrexed, like many chemotherapy drugs, can cause a range of side effects.  The severity and frequency of these side effects vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count, a type of white blood cell)
* Nausea
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Rash/desquamation (skin peeling)
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Vomiting

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 10% of patients, but potentially life-threatening):**

* Severe allergic reactions
* Severe bone marrow suppression
* Interstitial pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Renal failure
* Severe gastrointestinal problems
* Neurotoxicity (nerve damage)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or persistent ones, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Pemetrexed is an antifolate drug.  It works by interfering with the metabolic pathways crucial for cell growth and division, particularly those involving folic acid.  Pemetrexed inhibits several enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, including thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase.  By blocking these enzymes, Pemetrexed prevents the formation of essential building blocks needed for DNA and RNA replication, ultimately slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pemetrexed is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and in those receiving the yellow fever vaccine concurrently.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pemetrexed can interact with several other medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), nephrotoxic drugs, and other chemotherapy agents.  The potential for interactions necessitates careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.  Use of NSAIDs should be avoided or carefully managed around Pemetrexed dosing, particularly in patients with reduced kidney function.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is warranted in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.  Pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits of Pemetrexed treatment with their healthcare provider. Breastfeeding is not recommended during Pemetrexed therapy and for a week after the final dose.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver and kidney function, and other relevant parameters is essential during Pemetrexed treatment to detect and manage potential side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Pemetrexed administered?**  A: Pemetrexed is administered intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see a response to Pemetrexed varies depending on several factors, including the individual patient, the cancer type, and the treatment regimen.  It may take weeks or months before observable effects occur.
* **Q: How long is the treatment course?** A: The duration of Pemetrexed treatment depends on the cancer type, response to therapy, and the development of side effects. It's determined on a case-by-case basis by an oncologist.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a dose.  Do not attempt to double up on doses.
* **Q: How should Pemetrexed be stored?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication packaging. Generally, it should be stored at a controlled room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  Are there any dietary restrictions while taking Pemetrexed?** A: Patients are generally advised to consume a balanced diet and to maintain adequate hydration.  A diet rich in folic acid and vitamin B12 is often recommended, though specific dietary advice should come from a registered dietician and/or healthcare professional.  Alcohol should generally be avoided.
