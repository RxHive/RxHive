# Perindopril
### Generic Name
Perindopril

### Usage

Perindopril is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood. This helps lower blood pressure and reduces the strain on the cardiovascular system.  Perindopril is also indicated for the treatment of stable coronary artery disease (CAD), a condition where the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed.  In CAD, Perindopril helps to improve blood flow to the heart muscle.  While not explicitly listed on all labels, it's also sometimes used off-label in the management of heart failure, though this should only be done under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the condition being treated, the individual's health status (especially kidney function), and their response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.  Perindopril comes in tablet form.

* **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):**  The starting dose is typically low (e.g., 4 mg or 5 mg daily, depending on the specific salt of perindopril used - erbumine or arginine), gradually increasing as needed and tolerated under medical supervision, up to a maximum of 16 mg daily.

* **Stable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD):**  Treatment usually begins with a low dose (e.g., 4 mg or 5 mg daily) for a couple of weeks, then potentially increasing as tolerated to 8 mg or 10 mg daily under medical guidance.

* **Heart Failure (Off-Label):**  Starting doses are very low (e.g., 2 mg or 2.5 mg daily) with careful, gradual increases, as tolerated, up to a target dose typically within the range of 8-16 mg daily.  This is strictly under the care of a cardiologist.

**Renal Impairment:** Doses are significantly reduced or the dosing interval is increased in patients with impaired kidney function.  This is to prevent the build-up of the drug in the body.  In severe cases, perindopril may be contraindicated.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of perindopril in children have not been established, therefore its use in pediatric patients is not recommended.

**Note:**  These are general guidelines; individual dosages should always be determined and adjusted by a healthcare professional based on the patient's specific needs and response.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dry cough

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
*  Muscle cramps
* Skin rash

**Serious but Rare Side Effects (less than 1% of patients but requiring immediate medical attention):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) â€“ this is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*  Changes in kidney function
*  Significant drop in blood pressure
*  Low blood potassium levels

If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as serious or concerning, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Perindopril is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, perindoprilat, in the body.  Perindoprilat is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE is an enzyme involved in the body's regulation of blood pressure. By inhibiting ACE, perindoprilat reduces the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict.  This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), resulting in lower blood pressure.  Additionally, it reduces the amount of aldosterone, a hormone that causes the body to retain sodium and water. By reducing aldosterone, fluid is excreted, which also contributes to lower blood pressure.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Perindopril is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of serious harm to the developing fetus. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while taking this medication.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Perindopril is excreted in breast milk.  Consult a healthcare provider about whether to breastfeed while taking this medication.
* **Kidney problems:** Perindopril should be used with caution in patients with kidney disease, as it can further impair kidney function.  Dosage adjustments are often required.
* **Liver problems:** Perindopril should be used with caution in patients with liver disease.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Prior history of angioedema or allergic reactions to ACE inhibitors is a contraindication for using perindopril.
* **Other Medications:** Perindopril can interact with other medications, including diuretics, potassium supplements, and NSAIDs.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking perindopril suddenly?**  A: No, abruptly stopping perindopril can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: How should I store perindopril?** A: Store perindopril in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as per the directions on the packaging.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking perindopril?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure, potentially leading to adverse effects when combined with perindopril.  Moderate alcohol intake is generally acceptable, but it's best to discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q:  What if I experience a dry cough?** A: A dry cough is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors.  Consult your doctor, they may suggest alternatives if it becomes bothersome.  Do not stop the medication without your doctor's guidance.
