# Paricalcitol
### Generic Name
Paricalcitol

### Usage

Paricalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D analog primarily used to treat and prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism. This condition is characterized by overactive parathyroid glands, often a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD).  It's particularly helpful for individuals with stages 3 and 4 CKD and is also used in stage 5 CKD patients undergoing dialysis (both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis).  While its primary use is in managing secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with CKD,  it works by improving calcium and phosphorus balance, which are essential for overall bone health and other bodily functions affected by kidney disease.  It's crucial to remember that Paricalcitol doesn't treat the underlying CKD itself, but manages a serious complication stemming from it.  

### Dosage

Paricalcitol dosage is highly individualized and depends on factors including the patient's age, weight, the severity of hyperparathyroidism, the type of kidney disease, and whether they are on dialysis.  It's available in both oral (tablet or capsule) and intravenous (IV) formulations.


**Adults:**

* **Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (CKD on Dialysis):**  Intravenous administration is typical.  Dosage is usually started at 0.04-0.1 mcg/kg, given no more frequently than every other day during dialysis.  Subsequent doses are adjusted based on serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, calcium, and phosphorus, usually by a healthcare professional. Oral administration may also be used, with the initial dose calculated based on the baseline iPTH level. 
* **Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (Stages 3 or 4 CKD):** Oral administration is common.  The starting dose is determined based on the baseline iPTH level and adjusted according to regular monitoring of iPTH, calcium and phosphorus.


**Children:** Dosage for children (generally aged 10 years or older with stage 5 CKD) varies considerably depending on their age, weight, and iPTH levels and whether they are on dialysis.  Intravenous or oral administration might be used, with specific calculations necessary for initial and titration dosing based on iPTH levels.  A healthcare professional specializing in pediatric nephrology should always determine the appropriate dosage.  


**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments are frequently made based on regular monitoring of serum calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH levels.  These blood tests are crucial for guiding safe and effective treatment.  Never adjust the dosage independently; always consult a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages)
* Infections (various types)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium):  This is a potential, serious side effect that requires immediate medical attention.
* Hyperphosphatemia (high blood phosphorus):  Another serious concern, requiring monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.
* Allergic reactions (such as rash, itching, or swelling).  Seek immediate medical help if an allergic reaction occurs.


If any concerning side effects develop, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.  

### How it Works

Paricalcitol is a synthetic analogue of the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol).  It binds to vitamin D receptors in various cells, including those in the parathyroid glands, kidneys, intestines, and bones. By activating these receptors, it helps:

* Reduce the production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by the parathyroid glands.
* Enhance calcium absorption in the intestines.
* Increase calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.
* Improve calcium and phosphorus balance overall.


This action helps to regulate calcium and phosphorus levels, preventing or alleviating the symptoms associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism, leading to improvements in bone health and other aspects affected by the imbalance.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Paricalcitol should not be used by anyone with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Hypercalcemia:** Pre-existing hypercalcemia is a contraindication.  Careful monitoring of calcium levels is essential during treatment.
* **Vitamin D Toxicity:** Paricalcitol should not be used in individuals with vitamin D toxicity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Paricalcitol can interact with several other medications, including calcium supplements, phosphate binders, digitalis glycosides, certain diuretics, and some other vitamin D analogs.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy should only be considered if clearly necessary, as it falls into the FDA pregnancy category C. Breastfeeding mothers should consult with their physician as excretion into breast milk is unknown, and careful monitoring of the infant is necessary.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and require more careful monitoring.
* **Renal Impairment:** While no dosage adjustment is typically needed for renal impairment, careful monitoring is essential due to the underlying condition of the patients.  



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Paricalcitol with food?** A: The oral formulation can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How often do I need blood tests while on Paricalcitol?** A:  Frequent blood tests (calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH) are necessary, especially during the initial phases of treatment and after dosage adjustments.  The frequency will be determined by your healthcare provider.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not try to compensate for a missed dose by doubling up. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice on managing missed doses.
* **Q: How should I store Paricalcitol?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the product label carefully. Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Paricalcitol suddenly?** A: No, always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.  Sudden cessation may lead to adverse consequences.
