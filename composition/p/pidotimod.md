# Pidotimod

**Generic Name:** Pidotimod

**Usage:** Pidotimod is an immunomodulator used to treat recurrent respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children, particularly those with a history of frequent infections.  Its use is primarily focused on reducing the frequency and severity of these infections, not treating acute episodes.  The specific indications may vary by country.  It's important to note that pidotimod is not a first-line treatment for RTIs and is generally used only after other treatments have been considered or have proven ineffective.

**Side Effects:** Pidotimod is generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain. These are relatively common but usually mild and transient.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling are possible.
* **Other rare side effects:**  Headache, dizziness, and changes in liver function tests have been reported.

The frequency and severity of side effects can vary, and it is crucial to report any concerning symptoms to a doctor.

**How it Works:** Pidotimod's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to modulate the immune system by influencing several aspects of immune function. It's thought to:

* **Enhance T-lymphocyte function:**  This boosts the activity of immune cells crucial for fighting infections.
* **Stimulate antibody production:** This helps the body produce more antibodies to combat pathogens.
* **Increase phagocytosis:** This enhances the ability of immune cells to engulf and destroy pathogens.

By improving the overall functioning of the immune system, pidotimod aims to reduce the susceptibility to recurrent infections.
