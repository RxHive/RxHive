# Pidotimod
### Generic Name
Pidotimod

### Usage
Pidotimod is an immunostimulant primarily used to treat cell-mediated immunodepression in patients experiencing respiratory and urinary tract infections.  It works by boosting the body's immune response, helping it fight off infection more effectively.  While its primary use is in these types of infections, further research may explore its potential in other immune-related conditions.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the patient's age and the form of the medication:

**Adults (Respiratory or Urinary Tract Infection):**

*   **Oral Powder:**  The initial dose is typically 800 mg twice daily (BID) for two weeks. This is then followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg once daily (OD) for 60 days.

**Children â‰¥ 3 years and Adolescents (Respiratory or Urinary Tract Infection):**

*   **Oral Solution:** The starting dose is usually 400 mg twice daily (BID) for two weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg once daily (OD) for 60 days.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent (<1% incidence based on post-marketing surveillance and case reports).  These may include:

*   Angioedema (swelling under the skin)
*   Constipation
*   Diarrhea
*   Fever
*   Urticaria (hives)
*   Vomiting


While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any adverse reactions, particularly unusual or severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Pidotimod is a synthetic dipeptide that enhances both the innate and adaptive immune responses.  It achieves this by boosting the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, which are crucial components of the innate immune system, and by improving the function of phagocytes, cells that engulf and destroy pathogens.  By strengthening these immune mechanisms, pidotimod helps the body more effectively combat infections.


### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Pidotimod is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to pidotimod or any component of the formulation, and in those concurrently using other immunostimulant agents.
*   **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
*   **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with atopic or allergic disorders.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Avoid use during the first trimester of pregnancy.  The excretion of pidotimod in breast milk is currently unknown.  Consult a doctor before using pidotimod if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
*   **Drug Interactions:** The effects of pidotimod may be reduced when used concurrently with immunosuppressants.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
