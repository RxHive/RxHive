# Protriptyline
### Generic Name
Protriptyline

### Usage
Protriptyline is primarily used to treat depression.  It's a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), a class of medications that works differently than newer antidepressants like SSRIs and SNRIs.  While its primary use is for major depressive disorder, it may sometimes be considered for other conditions where its specific properties might be beneficial, though this is less common and should always be determined in consultation with a doctor.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual starting dose for depression is low (around 10 mg daily), gradually increasing in 5-10mg increments every 3-7 days  as tolerated,  up to a maximum of 60 mg per day.  The daily dose is typically divided into smaller doses taken throughout the day (e.g., three times daily).  Older adults may start with an even lower dose (5 mg three times daily) and need more careful monitoring due to increased sensitivity to side effects.  The doctor will adjust the dosage based on individual response and tolerance.

**Children:** Protriptyline is generally **not** recommended for children under 12 years of age due to a lack of sufficient safety and efficacy data.  For those 12 and older, the starting dose and increase schedules are determined by their physician, usually starting lower than the adult dose.

**Important Note:**  All dosage adjustments should be made under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  They will carefully monitor your response to the medication and adjust the dose accordingly to find the most effective and safe level.

### How it Works

Protriptyline works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters, namely serotonin and norepinephrine, in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are involved in regulating mood and emotions. By inhibiting their reuptake (reabsorption) by nerve cells, protriptyline allows these neurotransmitters to remain active in the synaptic cleft for a longer period, thereby improving mood and alleviating depressive symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Protriptyline should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to the medication or those currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  It's also contraindicated in patients with acute recovery from a heart attack or severe cardiovascular disease.
* **Interactions:** Protriptyline can interact with many other drugs, including other antidepressants, certain antihistamines, and some heart medications. It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Protriptyline is categorized as a pregnancy Category C drug, meaning potential risks to the fetus haven't been fully established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  The decision to use it during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made carefully with your doctor weighing the potential benefits against the risks.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults are generally more sensitive to the side effects of protriptyline, especially those related to the heart.  They require closer monitoring and lower starting doses.
* **Children:**  Use in children under 12 is not recommended.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  There is a risk of increased suicidal thoughts, especially in young adults. Close monitoring for such ideation is vital, particularly when starting treatment or adjusting dosages.
