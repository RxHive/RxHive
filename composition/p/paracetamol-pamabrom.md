# Paracetamol + Pamabrom

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Pamabrom

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of mild to moderate pain and menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever and relieves pain. Pamabrom is a diuretic (water pill) that helps to reduce bloating and fluid retention often associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menstrual cramps.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects are usually mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention and include:**

* Liver damage (especially with excessive paracetamol use)
* Kidney problems (especially with excessive pamabrom use)
* Low blood pressure
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)

This is not an exhaustive list, and individual reactions can vary.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, which are chemicals that cause pain and fever.
* **Pamabrom:** This is a mild diuretic that increases urine output.  It's thought to reduce bloating and fluid retention by promoting the excretion of sodium and water from the body, thereby alleviating symptoms related to water retention associated with PMS.
