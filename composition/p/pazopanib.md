# Pazopanib
### Generic Name
Pazopanib

### Usage
Pazopanib is primarily used to treat patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) and advanced soft tissue sarcoma (cancer of the connective tissues).  It's typically used in patients who have already received other chemotherapy treatments.  While not officially approved for these conditions, Pazopanib is sometimes used off-label to treat progressive desmoid tumors (benign but aggressive tumors of connective tissue) and advanced differentiated thyroid cancer.  Use in these off-label indications should be under the strict supervision of a qualified oncologist.

### Dosage
The standard adult dose of Pazopanib is 800 mg once daily (OD), orally, until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur. This applies to both advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced soft tissue sarcoma.  For off-label uses such as desmoid tumors, the same dosage is typically employed, but treatment may be limited to a maximum of one year.  The dosage for advanced differentiated thyroid cancer is also 800 mg OD.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary based on several factors, including liver and kidney function.  Patients with mild hepatic impairment generally do not require dose adjustments. However, those with moderate impairment may need a dose reduction to 200 mg OD, and it's generally not recommended for those with severe hepatic impairment.  Renal impairment usually does not require dosage changes, as Pazopanib is not primarily eliminated through the kidneys.  However, significant proteinuria (protein in the urine) may necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation.  Dose reductions are also recommended for various adverse effects such as hypertension, hemorrhagic events, and cardiac toxicity.  Specific adjustments depend on the severity of the adverse event and should be guided by a healthcare professional.  Pazopanib is not recommended for use in children; its safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations.

### Side Effects
Pazopanib, like many cancer therapies, can cause various side effects.  The frequency and severity vary from person to person. Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Decreased appetite
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
*   Hair discoloration
*   Weight loss

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Cardiac issues (decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, heart failure)
*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula (hole or abnormal connection in the digestive tract)
*   Hemorrhagic events (bleeding)
*   QTc prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm)
*   Thromboembolic events (blood clots)
*   Thrombotic microangiopathy (damage to small blood vessels)
*   Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)

If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Pazopanib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This means it works by blocking the activity of several enzymes (tyrosine kinases) involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Specifically, it targets several receptors crucial for angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow) and tumor cell survival.  By inhibiting these kinases, Pazopanib slows down tumor growth and can lead to tumor shrinkage.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Pazopanib is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Pazopanib can interact with many other medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme or those that prolong the QT interval (risk of abnormal heart rhythms).  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Pazopanib is classified as Category D during pregnancy, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus.  Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for at least two weeks after the final dose. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for two weeks after the last dose.
*   **Other Precautions:**  Patients with pre-existing liver or kidney problems should be carefully monitored.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure, liver function, thyroid function, and other relevant parameters is essential during treatment.  Pazopanib should be withheld before and after major surgeries to minimize the risk of complications.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Pazopanib with food?**  A: It's recommended to take Pazopanib on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal.

*   **Q: How should I store Pazopanib?** A: Store Pazopanib tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose and it's less than 12 hours until your next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose as usual. Don't double the dose.

*   **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Pazopanib?** A: Long-term effects are possible; ongoing monitoring for side effects is crucial throughout therapy and for a period after treatment ends.  A healthcare provider can discuss potential long-term risks and benefits.

*   **Q:  Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Pazopanib?** A: No, avoid grapefruit juice as it can interfere with the metabolism of Pazopanib, increasing its concentration in your blood and potentially raising the risk of side effects.
