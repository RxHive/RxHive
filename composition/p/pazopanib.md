# Pazopanib

**Generic Name:** Pazopanib

**Usage:** Pazopanib is used to treat certain types of advanced kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), advanced soft tissue sarcoma, and certain types of thyroid cancer.  It's a targeted therapy, meaning it works by specifically targeting cancer cells rather than affecting all rapidly dividing cells like traditional chemotherapy.  The specific type of cancer and the stage of the cancer will determine if pazopanib is an appropriate treatment.  A doctor will assess this.

**Side Effects:** Pazopanib can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can vary in severity from person to person.  Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak.
* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  This is a frequent and potentially serious side effect requiring monitoring.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can be severe in some cases.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Often managed with anti-nausea medication.
* **Loss of appetite:** Leading to potential weight loss.
* **Mouth sores (stomatitis):**  Can make eating painful.
* **Hair thinning (alopecia):** Often mild.
* **Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia):** Redness, swelling, pain, and numbness in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
* **Changes in liver function:** Requiring regular blood tests.


**Serious side effects:** While less common, serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* **Bleeding:**  Increased risk of bleeding, including internal bleeding.
* **Heart problems:**  Such as irregular heartbeats.
* **Blood clots:**  Increased risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs.
* **Kidney problems:** Worsening of existing kidney problems.
* **Severe infections:** Due to weakened immune system.


**How it Works:** Pazopanib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  This means it blocks the activity of certain enzymes called tyrosine kinases, which are crucial for the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Specifically, pazopanib targets several different receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), and c-Kit.  By inhibiting these receptors, pazopanib reduces the formation of new blood vessels that feed the tumor (angiogenesis), and also directly inhibits the growth and survival of cancer cells.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is pazopanib administered?**  A: Pazopanib is taken orally as a tablet.
* **Q: How long do I need to take pazopanib?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the response to treatment and the presence of side effects.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
