# Polystyrene Sulfonate

**Generic Name:** Polystyrene Sulfonate (various sodium and calcium forms exist, often specified in product names)

**Usage:**  Polystyrene sulfonate is primarily used as a **cation-exchange resin** in medicine, specifically to treat **hyperkalemia** (high potassium levels in the blood).  It's also used in some industrial applications, notably water treatment to remove dissolved cations.  The medical use will be the focus here.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can be significant and depend on the route of administration (usually oral) and the patient's overall health.  They include:

* **Constipation:** This is a very common and often severe side effect.  Patients may require laxatives or stool softeners.
* **Hypokalemia (low potassium):**  Paradoxical hypokalemia can occur if the resin binds too much potassium.
* **Dehydration:**  The resin can bind to water and electrolytes, potentially leading to dehydration.  Adequate fluid intake is crucial.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Besides potassium, other electrolyte imbalances (sodium, magnesium, calcium) are possible.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Gastrointestinal upset is common.
* **Bowel obstruction:**  In rare cases, large amounts of resin can cause bowel obstruction.
* **Hypocalcemia (low calcium):**  Especially with calcium-containing formulations.
* **Hypermagnesemia (high magnesium):**  Although less common, it can occur.

**How it Works:** Polystyrene sulfonate is an anionic resin containing negatively charged sulfonate groups (-SO₃⁻).  These groups attract and bind positively charged ions, such as potassium (K⁺), sodium (Na⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), and magnesium (Mg²⁺) in the gastrointestinal tract.  When administered orally, the resin exchanges its sodium or calcium ions for potassium ions in the gut, effectively removing potassium from the body through excretion in the feces.  This lowers the potassium levels in the blood.  The effectiveness depends on factors like the formulation, dosage, and patient's gastrointestinal function.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is polystyrene sulfonate absorbed into the bloodstream?** A:  No, it's not significantly absorbed.  Its action is primarily within the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Q: How is polystyrene sulfonate administered?** A:  Usually orally, as a powder or suspension mixed with water or juice.
* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A:  The effect on potassium levels can be seen within hours, but optimal reduction may take several days.
* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, it can interact with other medications.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions.  Simultaneous use with other medications can interfere with their absorption.
* **Q: Who should not use polystyrene sulfonate?** A: Patients with bowel obstruction, severe constipation, or known hypersensitivity to the drug.  Careful monitoring is needed in patients with other medical conditions, including renal impairment.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe constipation, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms.
