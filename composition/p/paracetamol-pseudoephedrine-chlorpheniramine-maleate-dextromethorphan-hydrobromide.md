# Paracetamol + Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) + Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu, including:

* **Fever:** Paracetamol reduces fever.
* **Pain:** Paracetamol relieves mild to moderate pain.
* **Nasal Congestion:** Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Runny Nose/Sneezing:** Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that reduces these symptoms.
* **Cough:** Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that reduces the urge to cough.

This medication is usually taken orally, following the dosage instructions on the packaging or as prescribed by a doctor.  It's crucial to follow the recommended dosage and not exceed it.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is particularly common with chlorpheniramine and can be exacerbated by the combination of ingredients.
* **Dry Mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines and some decongestants.
* **Dizziness:** Especially when standing up quickly.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Insomnia (difficulty sleeping):**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Nervousness/Irritability:**  More likely with pseudoephedrine.
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with pseudoephedrine.
* **Increased blood pressure:** More likely with pseudoephedrine.

Serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.  Paracetamol overdose can cause severe liver damage.


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates temperature.  It also relieves pain through mechanisms not fully understood.
* **Pseudoephedrine:**  A sympathomimetic amine that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing runny nose and sneezing.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A centrally acting cough suppressant that affects the cough center in the brain, reducing the urge to cough.
