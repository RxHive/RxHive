# Poractant Alfa
### Generic Name
Poractant Alfa

### Usage
Poractant alfa is a pulmonary surfactant replacement therapy.  Its primary use is in the rescue treatment of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).  This condition occurs when the lungs haven't yet developed enough surfactant, a substance that helps the lungs inflate and prevents them from collapsing.  Poractant alfa helps to reduce mortality and the incidence of pneumothoraces (collapsed lungs) in these infants.  It is not indicated for use in adults.

### Dosage
Poractant alfa is administered intratracheally (directly into the trachea via an endotracheal tube).  Dosage varies depending on whether it's used for prophylaxis (prevention) or treatment of RDS in neonates:

* **Prophylaxis (Prevention of RDS):**  1.25-2.5 mL/kg of birth weight administered once within 15 minutes of birth.

* **Treatment of RDS:** The initial dose is 2.5 mL/kg of birth weight. Up to two additional doses of 1.25 mL/kg of birth weight may be given at 12-hour intervals if the infant continues to require mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.  The maximum total dose is 5 mL/kg of birth weight.

**Important Considerations:**  Poractant alfa is not for use in adults.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.  Administration requires specialized training and equipment, and should only be performed by healthcare professionals experienced in managing premature infants with respiratory problems.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** The frequency of these side effects is not specifically defined in the provided information.

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Patent ductus arteriosus (a heart condition present in some newborns)
* Oxygen desaturation (low blood oxygen levels)
* Obstruction of the endotracheal tube

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Reported in less than 1% of cases, post-marketing, and/or from case reports:

* Pulmonary hemorrhage (bleeding in the lungs)

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.  Close monitoring is crucial after administration.


### How it Works
Poractant alfa is a synthetic pulmonary surfactant.  Naturally occurring pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension in the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs), preventing their collapse during breathing.  Premature infants often lack sufficient surfactant, leading to RDS.  Poractant alfa replaces this missing surfactant, restoring surface activity in the lungs and improving gas exchange. This helps the lungs inflate more easily and reduces the risk of lung collapse.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Poractant alfa is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of pulmonary hemorrhage, transient bradycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, endotracheal tube blockage, and hypotension.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Poractant alfa may enhance the bradycardic effects of other medications that slow the heart rate (e.g., bretylium, ceritinib, ivabradine, lacosamide, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib). Close monitoring is necessary if these medications are used concurrently.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Poractant alfa is not indicated for use in adults and therefore its use in pregnancy or lactation is not applicable.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Poractant Alfa administered?**
    * **A:** It's administered intratracheally (directly into the trachea) via an endotracheal tube by trained medical professionals.
