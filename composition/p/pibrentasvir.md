# Pibrentasvir
### Generic Name
Pibrentasvir

### Usage

Pibrentasvir is a medication used in combination with glecaprevir, another antiviral drug, to treat chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.  This combination therapy is effective against multiple genotypes (types) of HCV, including genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  It's approved for use in adults with or without cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), provided the cirrhosis is compensated (meaning the liver is still functioning adequately).  A key application is in treating patients who have previously been treated unsuccessfully with other HCV medications, either those containing an NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor (but not both). The combination targets different stages of the HCV life cycle for enhanced effectiveness.


### Dosage

Pibrentasvir is always administered in combination with glecaprevir, and the dosage is always a fixed-dose combination (FDC).  The standard adult dose is three tablets daily, taken with food.  Each tablet contains both glecaprevir (300mg) and pibrentasvir (120mg), providing a total daily dose of 300mg of glecaprevir and 120mg of pibrentasvir.  The duration of treatment varies depending on several factors:

* **Treatment-naive patients (never treated for HCV before):** 8 weeks for those without cirrhosis, and 12 weeks for those with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A).
* **Treatment-experienced patients (previously treated for HCV):** The duration and specific regimen depend on the prior treatment history (whether NS5A inhibitor or NS3/4A protease inhibitor was used previously).  Treatment durations range from 12 to 16 weeks.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration based on your medical history.

**Pediatric use:**  The safety and efficacy of pibrentasvir/glecaprevir in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Itchiness (pruritus)


Less common but serious side effects include reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection.  

**Important:**  This list doesn't include all possible side effects. If you experience any concerning symptoms, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Pibrentasvir works by inhibiting the NS5A protein of the Hepatitis C virus.  NS5A is crucial for the virus's replication and assembly.  By blocking NS5A, pibrentasvir prevents the virus from making copies of itself, ultimately leading to a reduction in the viral load. Glecaprevir, the drug it is combined with, works by inhibiting the NS3/4A protease, another vital viral protein involved in replication. This dual mechanism of action significantly enhances the effectiveness of the treatment.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Pibrentasvir/glecaprevir is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to either drug or its components.
* **Hepatic impairment:**  It's not recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and is contraindicated in those with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).  For patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), no dose adjustment is usually necessary.
* **Renal impairment:**  No dose adjustment is usually needed for patients with renal impairment, including those undergoing dialysis.
* **Drug interactions:**  Pibrentasvir/glecaprevir can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Some notable interactions involve statins (increased risk of myopathy), cyclosporine, ethinyl estradiol, lopinavir, rifampin, rosuvastatin, and St. John's Wort. Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting treatment.
* **Hepatitis B reactivation:** There is a risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients with prior or current HBV infection.  Monitoring for HBV reactivation is essential during and after treatment.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** The safety of pibrentasvir/glecaprevir during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Geriatric population:** No dose adjustment is usually required for patients 65 years or older.



### FAQs

**Q: How long does treatment with pibrentasvir/glecaprevir last?**

A: The treatment duration varies depending on the genotype of HCV, the presence or absence of cirrhosis, and prior treatment history.  It can range from 8 to 16 weeks. Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration for your specific situation.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

**Q: How should I store pibrentasvir/glecaprevir?**

A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and light.


**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking pibrentasvir/glecaprevir?**

A:  It's best to avoid alcohol during treatment, as excessive alcohol consumption can damage the liver and affect treatment outcomes. Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

**Q:  Are there any long-term effects of this treatment?**

A:  Long-term effects are generally uncommon; however, it's important to monitor for any unexpected symptoms.
