# Pinacidil
### Generic Name
Pinacidil

### Usage
Pinacidil is a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels.  Its primary use was in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It worked by relaxing the muscles in the walls of smaller arteries (arterioles), reducing peripheral vascular resistance, and thus lowering blood pressure.  Note that Pinacidil is no longer available in the United States due to its discontinuation by the FDA.

### Dosage
Dosage information for Pinacidil is not provided here because the drug is no longer available and prescribing information is outdated.  Any previous dosage recommendations should not be followed.

### Side Effects
Because Pinacidil is no longer available, a comprehensive list of side effects is not included here.  However, it's important to remember that all medications can cause side effects, and Pinacidil, like other vasodilators, likely had the potential for side effects such as:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Flushing
* Nausea
* Fluid retention (edema)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)


More serious, though less common, side effects were also possible.  **If you experienced any adverse effects while taking Pinacidil in the past, you should consult a medical professional.**

### How it Works
Pinacidil works by opening ATP-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. This opening of potassium channels causes hyperpolarization (a more negative membrane potential) in the smooth muscle cells of the arterioles.  This hyperpolarization inhibits calcium influx into the cells, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.  The resulting widening of blood vessels reduces peripheral resistance, thus lowering blood pressure. The drug's vasodilatory effect primarily targets arterioles, which are the small arteries that regulate blood flow to the tissues.

### Precautions
Because Pinacidil is no longer available, specific precautions are not detailed here. However, it's crucial to remember that medications of this class may interact with other drugs and have contraindications for certain individuals.  Any prior information on Pinacidil precautions should not be considered current or valid for use.
