# Pranlukast
### Generic Name
Pranlukast

### Usage
Pranlukast is primarily used for the long-term control of chronic asthma and to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  It's a maintenance medication, meaning it's taken regularly to prevent symptoms rather than to treat acute attacks.  While not its primary use, it can help manage the symptoms associated with both conditions, reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction in the airways.

### Dosage

**Adults (Allergic Rhinitis or Asthma):** The typical dose is 225 mg taken twice daily (BID), orally.

**Children (Allergic Rhinitis or Asthma):** Dosage for children aged 1 year and older, and adolescents, is determined by weight and is usually given orally as a disintegrating tablet or dry syrup.  The recommended dose is 7 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses, with a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day or 450 mg/day.  A weight-based chart can be more helpful:

* Weight ≥12 kg to <18 kg: 50 mg BID
* Weight ≥18 kg to <25 kg: 70 mg BID
* Weight ≥25 kg to <35 kg: 100 mg BID
* Weight ≥35 kg to <45 kg: 140 mg BID
* Weight ≥45 kg: 225 mg BID


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised when using Pranlukast in these patients, and close monitoring may be necessary.


### Side Effects

Pranlukast, like all medications, can have side effects. While not everyone experiences them, some common ones include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Sleep disturbances (insomnia)
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but more serious side effects, include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis – a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Liver problems (hepatic insufficiency)
* Blood abnormalities (eosinophilia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Psychiatric symptoms (depression, suicidal thoughts, aggressive behavior)
* Eosinophilic pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)


If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Pranlukast is a selective leukotriene D4 (LTD4) receptor antagonist. Leukotrienes are substances released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing inflammation and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways).  By blocking the LTD4 receptor, pranlukast prevents these leukotrienes from binding and thus reduces airway inflammation and constriction. This leads to improved breathing and reduced allergy symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Pranlukast is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Hepatic/Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease.
* **Pregnancy/Breastfeeding:** Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Alternative medications might be preferred during pregnancy. Breastfeeding is not recommended while using Pranlukast.
* **Warfarin Interaction:** Concurrent use with warfarin (a blood thinner) and other anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding.  Concomitant use should be avoided or carefully monitored.
* **Psychiatric Effects:**  There's an increased risk of psychiatric events, such as depression and suicidal thoughts.  Close monitoring is important, particularly in patients with a history of psychiatric conditions.
* **Eosinophilia and Vasculitis:**  An increased risk of eosinophilia (increased eosinophils in the blood) and vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) has been associated with this medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Pranlukast with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking.  Some interactions are possible, especially with anticoagulants.
* **Q: How should I store Pranlukast?** A: Store Pranlukast as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.
