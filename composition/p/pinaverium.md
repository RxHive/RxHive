# Pinaverium
### Generic Name
Pinaverium

### Usage
Pinaverium is primarily used to alleviate symptoms associated with functional disorders of the biliary tract.  This means it helps manage discomfort stemming from problems with the gallbladder and bile ducts,  not necessarily treating the underlying cause.  It's also employed to treat and provide relief from symptoms related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  The medication works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, thus reducing spasms and associated pain.  It's important to note that Pinaverium treats symptoms, not the root cause of the conditions.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For both Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and biliary disorders, the typical starting dose is 50 mg three times a day (TID).  This dose may be increased, up to a maximum of 100 mg TID, depending on the individual's response and the severity of their symptoms. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 300 mg.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Pinaverium in children have not been established; therefore, it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Because Pinaverium has low systemic absorption, dosage adjustments may not be necessary in these cases.  However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using Pinaverium if you have liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of Pinaverium are generally mild and may include:

* Abdominal distension
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common, but more serious side effects, that require immediate medical attention include:

* Allergic skin reaction
* Anaphylactic shock
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen)
* Erythema (redness of the skin)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Urticaria (hives)
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Xerostomia (dry mouth)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works
Pinaverium is a calcium channel antagonist.  It works by blocking the entry of calcium ions into the smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract.  Calcium is essential for muscle contraction. By reducing calcium influx, Pinaverium relaxes these muscles, thus reducing spasms and relieving pain associated with biliary tract disorders and IBS.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Pinaverium is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Pinaverium or any components of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:** Use caution in patients with esophageal irritation.  Some formulations may contain lactose; therefore, avoid use in patients with hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, congenital lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.  The safety of Pinaverium during pregnancy is not established. Some formulations may contain bromine, which could theoretically pose neurological risks to newborns if used late in pregnancy. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, making use in breastfeeding women inadvisable.  Avoid using Pinaverium to treat motility dysfunction caused by underlying diseases.
