# Paliperidone

**Generic Name:** Paliperidone

**Usage:** Paliperidone is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes).  It can also be used to treat depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as an adjunct to mood stabilizers.  It's available in both oral and injectable forms.  The injectable form is typically used for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia after an initial stabilization period with oral medication.

**Side Effects:**  Like other antipsychotics, paliperidone can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.

* **Common Side Effects:** These can include drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, weight gain, increased appetite, restlessness, anxiety, and trouble sleeping.
* **Serious Side Effects:**  More serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention.  These include:
    * **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):** A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
    * **Tardive dyskinesia (TD):**  A potentially irreversible movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements, especially of the face, mouth, tongue, and limbs.
    * **Prolongation of the QT interval:** This can increase the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities.
    * **Increased risk of stroke and death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.**
    * **Metabolic effects:**  Weight gain, increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia), and increased cholesterol and triglycerides.  These can increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
    * **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  These include muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness, and involuntary muscle movements.


**How it Works:** Paliperidone is a dopamine system stabilizer.  It works primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and cognition. By blocking dopamine receptors, paliperidone helps to reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.  It also has some effects on serotonin receptors, which may contribute to its efficacy in treating mood disorders.

**FAQs:**

* **Is paliperidone habit-forming?**  Paliperidone itself is not physically addictive, but stopping it suddenly after long-term use can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking paliperidone?**  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of paliperidone, especially drowsiness and dizziness.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can paliperidone cause drowsiness?**  Yes, drowsiness is a common side effect.  It's advisable to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how the medication affects you.
* **What should I do if I experience serious side effects?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects, such as high fever, muscle rigidity, difficulty swallowing, or unusual movements.
