# Paliperidone
### Generic Name
Paliperidone

### Usage

Paliperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.  It's effective as a standalone treatment (monotherapy) for schizophrenia and can also be used alongside mood stabilizers or antidepressants for schizoaffective disorder to improve symptom management.  While not its primary indication, it may sometimes be considered for other conditions under specific circumstances and physician guidance.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the patient's age, weight, condition severity, and renal function.  Always follow the prescription provided by your doctor.  Here's a general overview, and note that these are *not* recommendations for self-medication:

**Adults (Schizophrenia & Schizoaffective Disorder):**

* **Oral:**  The typical starting dose is 6 mg once daily. This may be adjusted to a range of 3-12 mg/day, but adjustments should be done carefully under medical supervision, with increases occurring only after a clinical assessment and at intervals longer than 4-5 days.
* **Intramuscular (IM) Injection:**  This is a longer-acting formulation.  Dosage and frequency (monthly or three-monthly) are highly individualized and depend on the patient's response.  The initial dose and subsequent maintenance dose are determined by the physician. The conversion between once-monthly and three-monthly injections, or from IM injection to oral tablets, also requires careful physician guidance.

**Children (Schizophrenia):**

* Oral:  Use in children under 12 is not established. For those 12 and older, the starting dose is lower (3 mg/day) and is adjusted based on weight (less than 51 kg versus 51 kg or more) and clinical response. The maximum dose is generally lower for children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are often needed for patients with liver or kidney problems.  Lower doses are usually recommended for those with moderate to severe kidney impairment. Patients with severe liver impairment should have their case carefully evaluated by a physician before using paliperidone.  Precise adjustment details must be determined in consultation with a medical professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include: drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms (muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness), headache, increased prolactin levels (which can affect menstrual cycles and libido),  and weight gain.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:  orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing), abnormal heart rhythms (QT prolongation), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a rare but life-threatening condition).  Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are also possible.

**If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Paliperidone is a metabolite of risperidone, another antipsychotic.  It works by affecting several neurotransmitter systems in the brain.  Specifically, it blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors which are implicated in the symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.  By altering the activity of these neurotransmitters, it helps to reduce psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.  Its effects on other receptors (alpha-adrenergic and histamine receptors) also contribute to its overall action and side effect profile.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Paliperidone is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to paliperidone or risperidone.
* **Drug Interactions:** Paliperidone can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the heart (QT-prolonging drugs) or the central nervous system. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Paliperidone is a category C pregnancy drug.  The risks and benefits of using paliperidone during pregnancy or while breastfeeding should be carefully weighed with a healthcare professional.
* **Elderly Patients:** There is an increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotics; paliperidone is not approved for this use.
* **Patients with Cardiovascular Disease:**  Caution is needed for patients with existing heart problems due to the potential for orthostatic hypotension and cardiac rhythm changes.
* **Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be required.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take paliperidone with alcohol?**  A: No, it's best to avoid alcohol while taking paliperidone, as it can increase drowsiness and other side effects.
* **Q: How should I store paliperidone?** A:  Store as directed on the medication label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking paliperidone suddenly?** A: No, always consult your doctor before stopping paliperidone treatment.  Sudden cessation may lead to withdrawal symptoms.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Is paliperidone habit-forming?** A: Paliperidone is not considered a habit-forming drug in the same way as opioids or other substances of abuse. However, it should only be taken as prescribed.
