# Parecoxib
### Generic Name
Parecoxib

### Usage

Parecoxib is a non-opioid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for the short-term management of acute postoperative pain in adults.  It's specifically designed to provide pain relief following surgical procedures.  It's not intended for long-term pain management or for treating chronic conditions.


### Dosage

**Adults:** Parecoxib is administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). The typical starting dose is 40 mg, followed by 20-40 mg every 6-12 hours as needed, not to exceed a total daily dose of 80 mg.  For patients at higher risk of fluid retention (such as those with pre-existing heart or kidney conditions), the initial dose should be reduced to 20 mg, and these patients should be closely monitored.  Always use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of parecoxib have not been established in children.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  For mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6), no dose adjustment is needed.  However, for moderate impairment (Child-Pugh score 7-9), the initial dose should be reduced by 50%, and the maximum daily dose should not exceed 40 mg.  Parecoxib is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥10). For renal impairment, if the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is greater than 30 mL/min, no dose adjustment is necessary. If CrCl is less than 30 mL/min, the lowest initial dose (20 mg) should be used, and renal function should be closely monitored.  Note that current guidelines generally advise against using NSAIDs when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nausea

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Agitation, dizziness, hypoesthesia, insomnia
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension (including severe hypotension), peripheral edema
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, vomiting
* Dermatologic: Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), pruritus (itching)
* Endocrine and metabolic: Hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Genitourinary: Oliguria (reduced urine production)
* Hematologic: Anemia (postoperative)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Back pain
* Renal: Increased serum creatinine levels
* Respiratory: Pharyngitis (sore throat), respiratory insufficiency

**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including serious ones like cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, and various allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema).  See the full list in the original data provided for a comprehensive overview.


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Parecoxib, like other NSAIDs, carries a risk of serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events (e.g., heart attack, stroke, bleeding, ulcers, perforation).  Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, are also possible, though rare.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or concerning ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Parecoxib is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, valdecoxib, in the body. Valdecoxib selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, parecoxib helps alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.  Importantly, at therapeutic doses, it does not significantly inhibit COX-1, an enzyme crucial for protecting the stomach lining, potentially reducing the risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Parecoxib is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to parecoxib, other NSAIDs, aspirin, sulfonamides, or any component of the formulation
* History of serious allergic drug reactions, especially skin reactions
* Active peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding
* History of bronchospasm, asthma, rhinitis, or urticarial reactions with NSAIDs or aspirin
* Severe hepatic impairment
* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Congestive heart failure (NYHA II-IV)
* Established ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, or cerebrovascular disease
* Perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery
* Third trimester of pregnancy
* Breastfeeding

**Interactions:** Parecoxib may interact with other medications, such as antihypertensives, anticoagulants, diuretics, lithium, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

**Warnings:** Parecoxib should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic or renal impairment, those at risk of fluid retention, and those performing tasks requiring mental alertness.  The use of NSAIDs close to conception may increase the risk of miscarriage, and chronic use may be associated with reversible infertility.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take Parecoxib?** A: Parecoxib is for short-term use only, typically for a few days post-surgery.  Do not exceed the prescribed duration.
* **Q: Can I take Parecoxib with other pain relievers?** A: Talk to your doctor before combining Parecoxib with other medications, including over-the-counter pain relievers.
* **Q: How should I store Parecoxib?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the medication label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is Parecoxib safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Parecoxib is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy and while breastfeeding.  Discuss pain management options with your healthcare provider during pregnancy.
