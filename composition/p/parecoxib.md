# Parecoxib

**Generic Name:** Parecoxib sodium

**Usage:** Parecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve moderate to severe pain, especially postoperative pain.  It's often used for short-term pain management, typically for up to 3 days following surgery.  It is *not* for long-term use.

**Side Effects:**  Like other NSAIDs, parecoxib can cause various side effects, though the frequency and severity vary among individuals.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, indigestion, heartburn.  More serious gastrointestinal complications like bleeding or ulcers are possible, though less common.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (although this risk is generally considered lower than with some other NSAIDs).
* **Allergic Reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling (especially of the face, lips, or tongue â€“ a sign of a serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention).
* **Renal (Kidney):**  Fluid retention, kidney problems (especially in individuals with pre-existing kidney disease).
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.


**How it Works:** Parecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor.  COX-2 is an enzyme involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By selectively inhibiting COX-2, parecoxib reduces the production of these prostaglandins, leading to pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects.  It is thought to have a lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects than non-selective NSAIDs because it doesn't inhibit COX-1, an enzyme that protects the stomach lining.  However, gastrointestinal side effects are still possible.
