# Plasma Protein Fraction
### Generic Name
Plasma Protein Fraction

### Usage
Plasma Protein Fraction is primarily used to treat shock resulting from the loss of plasma fluids. This includes situations such as burns, crushing injuries, or abdominal emergencies leading to significant fluid loss.  It's also indicated for emergency treatment of hemorrhagic shock.  Essentially, it replaces the proteins lost in these situations, helping restore blood volume and pressure.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Shock Treatment):**  The usual minimum intravenous (IV) dose is 250-500 mL (containing 12.5-25 g of protein).  The dose should be adjusted based on the patient's response to treatment.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.  However, for infants and young children with shock due to dehydration and infection, intravenous administration may be considered at 6.6-33 mL/kg (0.33-1.65 g/kg of protein), infused at a rate of 5-10 mL/min as needed. This should only be done under strict medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, though the exact frequency isn't specified, may include:

* Headache
* Edema (swelling)
* Flushing
* Hypotension (low blood pressure) – particularly linked to rapid infusion rate
* Nausea
* Urticaria (hives)
* Back pain
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)

Serious but less common side effects are possible.  Any adverse reaction should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Plasma Protein Fraction is primarily composed of albumin, a major protein in blood plasma. It acts as a volume expander, meaning it increases the blood volume by drawing fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream. This helps restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion (blood flow to tissues) in individuals experiencing shock due to fluid loss. It essentially provides a replacement for the proteins lost, contributing to the body's ability to maintain proper fluid balance and circulatory function.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Plasma Protein Fraction is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Plasma Protein Fraction, albumin, or any component of the formulation.
* Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.
* Severe anemia.
* Heart failure.
* Increased blood volume.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of hypotension (low blood pressure), especially with rapid infusion.  Careful monitoring of blood pressure and other vital signs is crucial.

**Other Precautions:**

* This medication is for intravenous use only.  Administration should begin within 4 hours of accessing the vial. Rapid infusion can cause vascular overload.
* Although rigorously screened, there remains a theoretical risk of transmitting infectious agents.
* Plasma Protein Fraction does not contain coagulation factors; it does not correct coagulation disorders.
*  Use caution in patients with pre-existing cardiac or circulatory conditions.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Plasma Protein Fraction is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Plasma Protein Fraction stored?**
A: Storage instructions should be found on the product label, but generally, it involves refrigeration.  Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines.


**Q: How long does it take to see effects?**
A: The effects will vary depending on the severity of the shock and the patient’s response, but improvement in blood pressure and fluid balance should be observed relatively quickly after administration.

**Q: Are there any drug interactions?**
A: While no specific drug interactions are listed, it's vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, to assess potential interactions or risks.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Stop the infusion immediately and seek immediate medical attention.
