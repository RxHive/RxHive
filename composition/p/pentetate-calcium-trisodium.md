# Pentetate Calcium Trisodium
### Generic Name
Pentetate Calcium Trisodium (Ca-DTPA)

### Usage
Pentetate calcium trisodium is a medication used to treat internal contamination with specific radioactive elements. Its primary use is to increase the rate of elimination of plutonium, americium, and curium from the body following accidental exposure or ingestion.  This chelating agent works by binding to these radioactive metals, forming a complex that is then excreted through the urine.  While primarily used for acute contamination, it may be considered in scenarios requiring ongoing chelation therapy if other options aren't available.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Ca-DTPA is most effective when administered within the first 24 hours of contamination.  If Ca-DTPA is unavailable, Pentetate zinc trisodium (Zn-DTPA) should be used initially, followed by daily Zn-DTPA if needed.  Never exceed one dose per 24 hours.

**Adults:**

* **Intravenous (IV):** Initial dose: 1 gram as a single dose.  If Zn-DTPA is unavailable for subsequent treatment, the maintenance dose is 1 gram daily. IV administration is preferred if the route of contamination is unknown or if multiple routes are suspected.
* **Inhalation (Nebulizer):**  Ca-DTPA should be diluted 1:1 with sterile water or saline before nebulization. This route is an alternative only when contamination occurred via inhalation within the preceding 24 hours.

**Children:**

* **Intravenous (IV):**
    * Children under 12 years: Initial dose: 14 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 1 gram). Maintenance dose (if Zn-DTPA unavailable): 14 mg/kg daily (up to a maximum of 1 gram). IV administration is preferred if the route of contamination is unknown or if multiple routes are suspected.
    * Children 12 years and older: Same as adult dose.
* **Inhalation (Nebulizer):** The safety and effectiveness of nebulized Ca-DTPA have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment. However, for heavily contaminated patients with renal impairment, high-efficiency high-flux dialysis may be used to enhance elimination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not specified):

* Anosmia (loss of smell)
* Chills
* Fever
* Muscle cramps
* Nausea
* Pruritus (itching)
* Vomiting
* Chest pain
* Dermatitis
* Diarrhea
* Metallic taste

Less common, but serious side effects:

* Trace element deficiency (particularly zinc, magnesium, and manganese, especially with prolonged treatment)
* Depletion of metalloproteinase

If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Pentetate calcium trisodium is a chelating agent. It works by binding to radioactive metals like plutonium, americium, and curium within the body.  This binding action forms stable complexes that are larger and more readily excreted through the kidneys in urine.  Essentially, it traps the radioactive metals and helps remove them from the body.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Increased Risk:**  Asthma exacerbation can occur with nebulized administration; prolonged treatment may lead to depletion of essential trace metals (zinc, magnesium, manganese).  Use caution in patients with severe hemochromatosis or asthma.
* **Pregnancy & Lactation:** Ca-DTPA is classified as Category C during pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown. Breastfeeding is strongly discouraged for women with suspected or confirmed internal contamination, regardless of chelation treatment.
* **Other Medications:**  Interactions with other medications are not explicitly listed but should be discussed with a healthcare professional.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of blood counts, kidney function (BUN, creatinine), electrolytes, and urinalysis is essential during treatment. Serum levels of essential trace metals should also be monitored, particularly with prolonged therapy.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A:  Treatment typically involves a single dose, but further treatment might be needed depending on the severity of contamination and the availability of Zn-DTPA.
* **Q: How is Ca-DTPA administered?** A:  It is typically administered intravenously or via nebulizer (inhalation). Intramuscular administration is not recommended.
* **Q: What should I do if I spill the medication?** A: Follow established safety protocols for handling radioactive materials. Immediately report the spill to the appropriate authorities and follow their instructions.
* **Q:  Are there long-term effects?** A:  Prolonged treatment increases the risk of trace metal depletion. Regular monitoring is crucial to detect and manage potential long-term effects.
* **Q: How should I store Ca-DTPA?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer. Usually, it involves storage at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
