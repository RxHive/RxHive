# Perhexiline
### Generic Name
Perhexiline

### Usage
Perhexiline is primarily used to treat chronic stable angina, a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It's reserved for patients whose angina isn't adequately controlled by other treatments or who can't tolerate those treatments, and who aren't suitable candidates for coronary bypass surgery.  Perhexiline's role is to reduce the frequency and severity of angina attacks.

### Dosage
**Adults:**  Treatment begins with an oral dose of 100 mg per day.  The dose is adjusted at intervals of 2-4 weeks, based on regular monitoring of Perhexiline plasma levels.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 300-400 mg, divided into multiple administrations.  Precise dosage adjustments are critical and require careful monitoring by a physician.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of perhexiline in children have not been established, and its use is not recommended in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Perhexiline is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Adjustments aren't applicable due to the contraindications for patients with reduced liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects
Perhexiline can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare but potentially serious. Common side effects may include:

*   Nervous system effects: Dizziness, headache, insomnia, nervousness, numbness or tingling (paresthesia), unsteady gait, fatigue.  More serious neurological effects like peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) can occur.
*   Cardiovascular effects:  Changes in heart rhythm (ECG abnormalities), flushing.  Serious effects like syncope (fainting) or torsades de pointes (a dangerous heart rhythm) are possible.
*   Gastrointestinal effects: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia (loss of appetite).
*   Dermatological effects: Skin rash, excessive sweating (diaphoresis).
*   Metabolic effects: Changes in blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia in diabetics), changes in lipid levels, weight loss.
*   Hepatic effects:  Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) ranging from increased liver enzyme levels to serious liver diseases.

**Serious, though less frequent, side effects may require immediate medical attention.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or severe symptoms.**

### How it Works
Perhexiline works by altering the way the heart muscle uses energy.  It inhibits the action of enzymes (CPT-1 and CPT-2) involved in the breakdown of fatty acids for energy. By reducing the heart's reliance on fatty acids, Perhexiline shifts its energy source to glucose and lactate, improving the heart's efficiency and reducing the oxygen demand that triggers angina. This improved efficiency reduces the frequency and severity of angina attacks.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Perhexiline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, porphyria (a group of genetic blood disorders), hepatic impairment, or renal impairment.
*   **Interactions:** Perhexiline can interact with several drugs, including insulin, other antidiabetic medications, beta-blockers, and Adriamycin (doxorubicin).  These interactions can lead to increased risk of hypoglycemia or drug toxicity.  Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking.  CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitors or substrates also warrant caution.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Perhexiline during pregnancy is not fully established.  It's generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
*   **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for neurological side effects like peripheral neuropathy, and hepatic toxicity (liver function tests and symptoms like fatigue, loss of appetite, and jaundice).  Patients should avoid tasks requiring alertness if they experience dizziness or weakness.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Perhexiline with food?** A: Perhexiline can be taken with or without food, but it should always be swallowed whole with water.
*   **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of Perhexiline's effect varies, but improvements in angina symptoms generally become apparent over several weeks as the dosage is adjusted.
*   **Q: How should I store Perhexiline?** A: Store Perhexiline as directed on the prescription label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and sunlight.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
*   **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: Long-term use of Perhexiline can potentially lead to peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. Regular monitoring by a physician is crucial.
