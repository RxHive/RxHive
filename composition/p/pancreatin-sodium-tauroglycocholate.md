# Pancreatin + Sodium Tauroglycocholate

**Generic Name:** Pancreatin + Sodium Tauroglycocholate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to help digest food.  It's typically prescribed for people with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition where the pancreas doesn't produce enough enzymes to properly break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates in food.  This can be caused by conditions like cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer. It may also be used off-label for other digestive issues, but this should only be done under a doctor's supervision.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are relatively infrequent but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, constipation.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing.
* **Hyperuricemia:** Increased uric acid levels in the blood (rare, more likely with prolonged use).


**How it Works:**

* **Pancreatin:** This is a pancreatic enzyme supplement containing amylase (breaks down carbohydrates), lipase (breaks down fats), and protease (breaks down proteins). It replaces the enzymes the pancreas is unable to produce, allowing for proper digestion and nutrient absorption.

* **Sodium Tauroglycocholate:** This is a bile salt. Bile salts aid in the digestion and absorption of fats.  By improving fat digestion, it enhances the effectiveness of the lipase in pancreatin.
