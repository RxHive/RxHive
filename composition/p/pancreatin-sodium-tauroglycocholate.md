# Pancreatin + Sodium Tauroglycocholate
### Generic Name
Pancreatin + Sodium Tauroglycocholate


### Usage

Pancreatin + Sodium Tauroglycocholate is a combination medication used to treat pancreatic enzyme insufficiency. This means it's prescribed for individuals whose pancreas doesn't produce enough enzymes to properly digest food.  The pancreas naturally produces enzymes crucial for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.  When the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient quantities of these enzymes (due to conditions like cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, or after pancreatic surgery), undigested food can lead to various digestive problems.

This combination medication works by supplementing these missing enzymes. Pancreatin provides the pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase, and protease) needed for carbohydrate, fat, and protein digestion, respectively.  Sodium tauroglycocholate, a bile salt, aids in the absorption of fats, enhancing the effectiveness of lipase. Therefore, the combination improves overall nutrient absorption and alleviates symptoms associated with malabsorption.  The primary use is to reduce symptoms of maldigestion, such as steatorrhea (fatty stools), abdominal pain, bloating, and weight loss.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the individual's age, weight, the severity of pancreatic insufficiency, and the specific formulation (e.g., capsules, tablets, granules).  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions meticulously.  There isn't a standard "adult" or "child" dosage that can be provided here; dosage is always tailored to the patient's needs.

**Administration:**  Oral administration is typical. Capsules or tablets are usually swallowed whole with meals or snacks. Granules might need to be mixed with food to aid ingestion.  Intravenous (IV) administration is not applicable for this medication as it needs to work within the digestive system.  Always adhere to the physician's guidance on timing, frequency, and amount of medication relative to meals.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting. These are often mild and might resolve as the body adjusts to the medication.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels), abdominal pain (severe), formation of fibrous tissue around the medication (in the intestine â€“ a rare complication), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).  
* **Note:**  If any severe or persistent side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.  Even seemingly minor side effects warrant a consultation if they're concerning or don't improve.

### How it Works

Pancreatin contains amylase, lipase, and protease.  Amylase breaks down carbohydrates, lipase breaks down fats, and protease breaks down proteins.  These enzymes are essential for the efficient breakdown of food in the small intestine.  Without sufficient levels, undigested food passes through, leading to malabsorption and the associated symptoms.  Sodium tauroglycocholate enhances fat absorption by assisting in the emulsification of fats, making them more accessible to lipase.  The combined action improves nutrient digestion and absorption, alleviating the symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Known hypersensitivity to any component of the medication is a contraindication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Pancreatin might interact with certain medications, notably those affecting blood clotting. Inform your physician about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be considered after careful assessment of benefits and risks by a physician.
* **Children:**  Dosage for children is always tailored to their individual needs and weight.
* **Elderly:**  Older adults might require dosage adjustments due to potential age-related changes in digestive function.
* **Conditions requiring caution:**  Individuals with a history of hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels) or bowel obstruction should be monitored closely.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication without a prescription?** A: No.  Pancreatin + Sodium Tauroglycocholate is a prescription medication.  Self-medicating can be risky. Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store according to the label instructions, typically in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
