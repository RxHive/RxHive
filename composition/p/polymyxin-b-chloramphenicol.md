# Polymyxin B + Chloramphenicol
### Generic Name
Polymyxin B + Chloramphenicol

### Usage

Polymyxin B + Chloramphenicol is a combination antibiotic used primarily to treat serious bacterial eye infections, particularly those affecting the cornea (the clear front part of the eye).  It's often employed when a single antibiotic might not be sufficient to tackle the infection effectively.  While primarily used for ophthalmic (eye-related) applications,  in some rare instances and under strict medical supervision, this combination might be considered for other severe bacterial infections, though this is not its typical application.  The specific bacterial strains targeted are those susceptible to both Polymyxin B and Chloramphenicol.  A doctor will determine if this combination is appropriate based on the specific infection and the results of culture and sensitivity tests.

### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary greatly depending on the specific formulation (eye drops, ointment), the severity of the infection, and the patient's age and overall health.  **It is crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.**  There is no standard "over the counter" availability for this combination drug; it is always prescribed by an ophthalmologist or physician.

* **Ophthalmic Use (Eye):** The most common application is topical, meaning it is applied directly to the eye.  Dosage and frequency are determined by the physician and usually involve several instillations or applications per day for a specified duration.

* **Other Routes (Very Rare):** While extremely uncommon, in very specific and severe cases (not related to ophthalmic issues) this combination might be administered intravenously (IV) or in other ways. The dosages and administration methods would be entirely determined and strictly monitored by a specialist physician.  Dosage for any route other than ophthalmic is not typically found in readily available sources because it is extremely unusual.

**Pediatric Use:**  Use in children must be under strict medical supervision. The dosage and safety in young children may be different from that of adults.  

**Adult Use:**  Dosage for adults is likewise determined by the physician based on the severity and type of infection.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects (Ophthalmic Use):** Burning or stinging sensation in the eye, temporary blurred vision, mild eye irritation.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Ophthalmic and Other Routes):** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), blood disorders (rare but potentially life-threatening), kidney damage (especially with systemic administration),  neurological side effects (including hearing loss â€“ more likely with systemic use).

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Polymyxin B and Chloramphenicol work by targeting bacteria in different ways, making the combination more effective.  Polymyxin B is a polypeptide antibiotic that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. Chloramphenicol inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing the bacteria from reproducing and growing.  By attacking the bacteria from two different angles, the combination can be more potent than either drug alone against susceptible bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Prior hypersensitivity to either Polymyxin B, Chloramphenicol, or any component of the formulation is a contraindication (meaning the drug should absolutely not be used).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal) and supplements you are taking, as interactions can occur.

* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Caution is advised in patients with impaired kidney or liver function, as these organs play a role in the metabolism and elimination of the drugs.

* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Chloramphenicol can suppress bone marrow function, potentially leading to blood disorders.  Regular blood tests may be needed during treatment.

* **Age Considerations:** The safety and efficacy may differ across age groups; always follow physician instructions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this medication without a prescription?** A: No, this is a prescription-only medication.  It should only be used as directed by an ophthalmologist or physician.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with the medication. Generally, this involves keeping it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double the dose; apply or take the next dose as soon as you remember.  If it's close to the next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose.
