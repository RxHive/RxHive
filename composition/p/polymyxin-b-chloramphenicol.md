# Polymyxin B + Chloramphenicol

**Generic Name:** Polymyxin B Sulfate + Chloramphenicol

**Usage:**  This combination is primarily used topically (applied to the skin or eyes) to treat bacterial infections of the eyes and skin, particularly those caused by susceptible Gram-negative bacteria.  It is *not* typically used systemically (orally or intravenously) due to the significant side effects associated with systemic chloramphenicol.  Specific indications might include conjunctivitis (pinkeye), superficial skin infections, and otitis externa (swimmer's ear) in some cases, although the use is becoming less common due to resistance concerns and availability of alternatives.  Always consult a physician for appropriate usage.

**Side Effects:**

* **Topical application:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized when applied topically.  They can include burning, stinging, itching, redness, and swelling at the application site.  Allergic reactions, although rare, are possible.  Prolonged use can lead to irritation.

* **Systemic absorption (though unlikely with topical application):**  Systemic absorption, although rare with topical use, can lead to the more severe side effects associated with chloramphenicol, including:
    * **Blood disorders:**  Bone marrow suppression (aplastic anemia, a life-threatening condition), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and leukopenia (low white blood cell count).
    * **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
    * **Neurological effects:**  Headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy.
    * **Gray baby syndrome (in infants):**  A serious and potentially fatal condition characterized by cardiovascular collapse, gray discoloration of the skin, and respiratory distress.  This is particularly relevant with systemic administration, but even small amounts of systemic absorption can pose a risk to infants.


**How it Works:**

* **Polymyxin B:** This is a polypeptide antibiotic that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. It is primarily effective against Gram-negative bacteria.

* **Chloramphenicol:** This is a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic antibiotic (meaning it inhibits bacterial growth rather than directly killing them) that binds to bacterial ribosomes, preventing protein synthesis essential for bacterial survival.  It's effective against a wider range of bacteria, including some Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.

The combination of these two antibiotics provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination available in all countries?** No, availability varies by region and regulatory approvals.  It is less commonly prescribed than in the past due to resistance issues and safety concerns surrounding chloramphenicol.

* **Can I use this without a doctor's prescription?** No.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using any medication, especially antibiotics.  Improper use can lead to antibiotic resistance and serious side effects.

* **What if I experience side effects?**  Discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately if you experience any adverse reactions.

* **Are there alternatives?** Yes, many other topical antibiotic ointments and eye drops are available to treat bacterial infections, offering potentially safer and equally effective alternatives.

* **Is this safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered under strict medical supervision due to the potential risks associated with chloramphenicol.
