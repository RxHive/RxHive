# Prothionamide
### Generic Name
Prothionamide

### Usage
Prothionamide is a second-line antitubercular drug used primarily in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).  It's not a first-line treatment because of its significant side effects and the availability of safer alternatives for drug-susceptible TB. Prothionamide is always used in combination with other antituberculosis medications, never alone.  It has also shown some activity against atypical mycobacteria and has been investigated for use in leprosy treatment, though this application isn't widespread.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage for MDR-TB, in both intensive and continuous phases, is typically 500 mg to 1 g per day, divided into 1-3 doses. Some sources recommend a dosage of 15-20 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 1 g/day.  The dose is gradually increased over several days to reach the optimal level.  Concurrent use of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is often recommended to help prevent neurological side effects.  When used with isoniazid, the maximum dose is reduced to 500 mg/day.

**Children:** For MDR-TB, the recommended dose is 10 mg/kg/day, divided into 1-3 doses, with a maximum daily dose of 1 g.  Alternative recommendations suggest 15-20 mg/kg/day divided into 2-3 doses, again with a maximum of 1 g daily.  Gradual dose titration and concurrent pyridoxine are recommended.  When used with isoniazid, the maximum dose is 10 mg/kg/day or 500 mg/day, whichever is less.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are given for mild to moderate hepatic impairment, but caution is advised. Prothionamide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustments are recommended for renal impairment, but caution is again warranted.

### Side Effects

**Common (Frequency >10%):**

* Metallic taste
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Dysgeusia (altered taste, often described as a sulfurous taste)
* Nausea
* Sialorrhea (increased saliva production)
* Dry mouth


**Less Common (Frequency 1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Weakness
* Hepatitis
* Jaundice


**Rare (Frequency <1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**  A wide range of other side effects are possible, including neurological problems (psychosis, encephalopathy, peripheral and optic neuritis), thyroid problems (hypothyroidism), visual disturbances, skin reactions, gastrointestinal issues, and blood disorders.  Many more are listed in the detailed information, highlighting the need for careful monitoring.  Severe liver damage and other life-threatening conditions are possible, though uncommon.


**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Prothionamide inhibits the synthesis of proteins essential for the growth and survival of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria that cause tuberculosis.  It achieves this through a cell-based activation mechanism.  It's considered bacteriostatic (slows bacterial growth) at therapeutic concentrations.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Prothionamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to prothionamide or ethionamide, severe hepatic impairment, epilepsy, or psychosis.
* **Increased Risk:**  Prothionamide increases the risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage), neurological effects (including psychotic disturbances), hypothyroidism, visual disturbances, and hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes (may cause hypoglycemia), renal or hepatic dysfunction, acute gastritis or gastric ulcer, thyroid dysfunction, or allergies to certain dyes.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Prothionamide can interact with other drugs, such as cycloserine (increased neurotoxicity risk), isoniazid (increased prothionamide serum levels), p-aminosalicylic acid (increased risk of hypothyroidism and hepatotoxicity), and rifampicin (increased risk of hepatotoxicity).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Limited data exist on its use during pregnancy.  It's generally recommended to avoid use during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.  It's excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding is not recommended while taking prothionamide.  Pyridoxine supplementation is recommended for both the mother and infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take prothionamide with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as prothionamide can interact with some medications.
* **Q: How should I store prothionamide?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is within 6 hours of your next dose. Do not take a double dose.
* **Q: Is prothionamide safe for long-term use?** A:  Prothionamide's long-term safety profile is a concern due to its significant side effect potential.  It's usually used for a specific duration in combination therapy and under close medical supervision.  Regular monitoring of liver function and other parameters is essential.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking prothionamide?** A: Excessive alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged because it can increase the risk of psychotic reactions.
