# Poliovirus Vaccine (Live/Bivalent/Oral)
### Generic Name
Poliovirus Vaccine (Live/Bivalent/Oral)

### Usage
Poliovirus Vaccine (Live/Bivalent/Oral), often referred to as OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine), is primarily used for active immunization against poliomyelitis.  Specifically, it protects against infection caused by poliovirus types 1 and 3.  This vaccine is crucial in preventing the debilitating and potentially fatal effects of polio, including paralysis. While primarily used for preventing polio, its use contributes to the global eradication efforts of this disease.

### Dosage

**For Poliovirus Prevention:**

* **Primary Immunization (Infants and Children >6 weeks):** The recommended dose is 0.1 mL (2 drops) orally for each of three doses, administered at least four weeks apart.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a birth dose (zero dose) followed by the primary series in certain high-risk areas.
* **Primary Immunization (Adults):** The same dosage as for infants and children older than 6 weeks applies to adults who require primary immunization against polio.
* **Booster Immunization (Children and Adults):** A single dose of 0.1 mL (2 drops) orally is typically sufficient.

**Important Note:** The vaccine is for oral administration only; it should never be injected.  The drops should be administered directly into the mouth, avoiding contact between the dropper and saliva.  The vaccine may be mixed with food or beverages that don't inactivate the polioviruses, such as simple syrup, milk, bread, or a lump of sugar.

### Side Effects

Common side effects, which are generally mild and transient, include:

* Diarrhea
* Fever
* Vomiting

Serious side effects, though rare,  include the possibility of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) leading to outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms after vaccination should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

The Poliovirus Vaccine (Live/Bivalent/Oral) contains live, attenuated (weakened) strains of poliovirus types 1 and 3. When administered orally, these weakened viruses replicate in the intestines, inducing an immune response. This response generates antibodies that protect against future infections with wild-type polioviruses.  The body's immune system learns to recognize and fight off the poliovirus without causing the disease.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine, primary or secondary immunodeficiency (except HIV), immunodeficiency due to immunosuppressant treatment, household contact with immunocompromised individuals, a history of acute flaccid paralysis after receiving the vaccine, and infants younger than 6 weeks old.
* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), which can lead to outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis.  Individuals with close contact to immunocompromised persons should use caution.
* **Interactions:**  This vaccine may interact with other medications, affecting their efficacy or the vaccine's effectiveness. Specifically, it may decrease the effectiveness of tuberculin skin tests and other live vaccines.  Conversely, certain immunosuppressant drugs may reduce the effectiveness of the polio vaccine.  Consult a healthcare professional about any medications you are currently taking before receiving this vaccine.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Pregnant women at increased risk for wild poliovirus infection may receive the vaccine.  However, females of childbearing potential should use contraception for three months following vaccination.  The excretion of the vaccine in breast milk is unknown, but infants receiving the vaccine can be breastfed; however, administration should be separated by 2 hours before or after vaccination.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I get polio from this vaccine?** A: The vaccine contains weakened polioviruses. While there is a minimal risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, it's significantly lower than the risk of contracting polio from the wild virus.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your healthcare provider or on the vaccine packaging.  Generally, it needs to be stored at a consistently cold temperature to maintain its effectiveness.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Most side effects are mild.  However, if you experience anything concerning, contact your doctor immediately.

* **Q: Is this vaccine effective for everyone?** A: While generally effective, the immune response can vary between individuals.  Some individuals may not develop full immunity.  This vaccine may not prevent or modify the course of disease in individuals already infected with wild-type poliovirus.

* **Q: Can I receive this vaccine if I'm taking other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking before receiving this vaccine to assess potential interactions.
