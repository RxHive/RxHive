# Pyrethrins + Piperonyl butoxide
### Generic Name
Pyrethrins + Piperonyl Butoxide

### Usage
Pyrethrins + Piperonyl butoxide is a combination medication used topically to treat infestations of *Pediculus humanus*, which includes head lice, body lice, and pubic lice, along with their eggs (nits).  This combination is effective because it leverages the insecticidal properties of pyrethrins, enhanced by piperonyl butoxide, which inhibits the metabolism of pyrethrins in the lice, increasing its effectiveness.

### Dosage
**Pediculus humanus Infestations:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥2 years:**  The typical dosage involves applying a shampoo containing 0.33% pyrethrins and 4% piperonyl butoxide to dry hair and/or other infested areas.  Leave the product on for 10 minutes, then wash and rinse thoroughly.  Repeat the treatment in 7-10 days if necessary.  Always follow the specific instructions on the product label.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, although the frequency is not precisely defined, can include:

* Localized burning sensation
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin irritation (especially with repeated use)
* Stinging of the skin

While rare, more serious side effects can occur.  If breathing difficulties or eye irritation develop, or if skin or scalp irritation persists or worsens (potentially indicating an infection), discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Pyrethrins are naturally occurring insecticides that work by disrupting the nerve function of lice. They affect the neuronal membranes, causing paralysis and ultimately death of the insects. Piperonyl butoxide acts as a synergist, meaning it enhances the effectiveness of pyrethrins by inhibiting the lice's ability to metabolize and break down the pyrethrins.  This allows the pyrethrins to remain active for a longer period, leading to better control of the infestation.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to pyrethrins, piperonyl butoxide, or any other component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of topical irritation, especially with repeated use or prolonged exposure.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The CDC (2015) guidelines suggest that pregnant and breastfeeding women can generally use pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide for lice treatment, though excretion in breast milk is not fully established.  Consult a healthcare professional before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **General Precautions:** This is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and other mucous membranes. If accidentally ingested, contact a poison control center or seek immediate medical attention.
