# Piroxicam

**Generic Name:** Piroxicam

**Usage:** Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It's also sometimes used to treat acute gouty arthritis and tendinitis.  It reduces pain, swelling, stiffness, and inflammation.

**Side Effects:**  Like other NSAIDs, piroxicam can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare but potentially serious.  These include:

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Fluid retention (edema), high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attack and stroke, ulcers, bleeding in the stomach or intestines (which can be fatal), kidney problems, liver problems, blood disorders (including anemia), hearing loss, ringing in the ears (tinnitus).
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions, including skin rashes, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), and difficulty breathing can occur.  Stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention if you experience these symptoms.

**How it Works:** Piroxicam works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, piroxicam helps to alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory conditions.
