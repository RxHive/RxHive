# Piroxicam
### Generic Name
Piroxicam

### Usage
Piroxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  These are all forms of arthritis characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.  Piroxicam works by reducing inflammation and pain, thereby improving joint mobility and function. While its primary use targets these chronic inflammatory conditions, it may also be used to manage acute pain in certain situations,  though this is less common due to the availability of other NSAIDs with potentially better short-term pain relief profiles.  It's crucial to remember that piroxicam treats symptoms and does not cure the underlying disease.

### Dosage

Dosage recommendations for piroxicam vary depending on the individual's condition, age, and overall health.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  Generally:

* **Oral Administration (Capsules/Tablets):**  The typical adult dose is 20 mg once daily.  However, some doctors may start with a lower dose (10mg) and gradually increase it as tolerated.  Children should not generally take piroxicam. The medication should not be taken at higher doses without medical advice.

* **Intravenous (IV) Administration:** Piroxicam is not typically administered intravenously.  Oral administration is the standard route.

**Important Considerations:**  Elderly patients and those with kidney or liver problems may require a lower dose or more frequent monitoring due to the increased risk of side effects.  It's vital to discuss any pre-existing conditions with your physician before starting piroxicam.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of piroxicam include:

* Nausea
* Heartburn
* Stomach pain
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation or diarrhea
* Swelling in the ankles or feet (edema)

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe stomach pain or bleeding
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems
* Increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use or high doses)

**If you experience any of these side effects, particularly severe ones, stop taking piroxicam immediately and contact your doctor.**

### How it Works

Piroxicam works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, piroxicam helps to decrease inflammation and alleviate pain in affected joints.  This mechanism is typical of many NSAIDs.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Piroxicam should not be taken by people with known allergies to piroxicam or other NSAIDs, individuals with active peptic ulcers or bleeding, or those with severe heart, liver, or kidney disease.

* **Drug Interactions:** Piroxicam can interact with many other medications, including blood thinners (warfarin), aspirin, other NSAIDs, lithium, and certain diuretics.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Piroxicam should be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the late stages, and breastfeeding unless specifically recommended by a doctor due to the potential risks to the fetus or infant.

* **Older Adults:**  Older adults are at increased risk of side effects from piroxicam, including gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney problems. Close monitoring is crucial.

* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Excessive alcohol use may increase the risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding when taking piroxicam.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be considered.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for piroxicam to work?**  A:  You may start to feel some relief from pain and inflammation within a few days, but the full therapeutic effect may take several weeks.

* **Q: Can I stop taking piroxicam suddenly?** A: No, you should always talk to your doctor before stopping piroxicam.  Sudden discontinuation may cause withdrawal symptoms or worsen your condition.

* **Q: How should I store piroxicam?** A: Store piroxicam in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture, as directed on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Is piroxicam habit-forming?** A: No, piroxicam is not considered a habit-forming medication.
