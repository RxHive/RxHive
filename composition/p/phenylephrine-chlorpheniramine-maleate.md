# Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever, and other allergies.  Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passages, providing relief from nasal congestion. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that reduces the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Together, they help relieve stuffy nose, sneezing, and runny nose.  It's important to note that this combination is often available over-the-counter, but it's crucial to follow the dosage instructions precisely.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect of chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth:** Both phenylephrine and chlorpheniramine can cause dry mouth.
* **Dizziness:** Particularly with higher doses.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:** Less frequent but possible.
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Constipation:** Less frequent but possible.
* **Increased heart rate:** More likely with phenylephrine, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  More likely with phenylephrine.


Serious side effects are rare but possible and include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Phenylephrine:** This sympathomimetic amine acts as a decongestant by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages. This causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is a first-generation antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine at H1 receptors.  Histamine causes many allergy symptoms, so blocking it reduces sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
