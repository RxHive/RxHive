# Phloroglucinol
### Generic Name
Phloroglucinol

### Usage
Phloroglucinol is primarily used as an antispasmodic agent.  Its main application is in providing symptomatic relief from acute smooth muscle spasms. This includes spasms affecting various parts of the body, such as:

*   **Renal colic:**  Severe pain in the flank and abdomen caused by kidney stones.
*   **Gastrointestinal spasms:** Painful contractions of the muscles in the stomach and intestines.
*   **Urogenital spasms:** Painful contractions of the muscles in the urinary and genital tracts.
*   **Uterine contractions:**  Painful contractions of the uterine muscles (though often used as an adjuvant therapy in this case, meaning it's used alongside other treatments).


### Dosage

**Adults:** For spasms, the recommended oral dose is 160 mg (20 mL of an 8 mg/mL solution) as a single dose at the onset of symptoms.

**Children:** For spasms, the recommended oral dose is 80 mg (10 mL of an 8 mg/mL solution), up to twice in a 24-hour period.


**Important Considerations:** The dosage may need adjustment based on the severity of symptoms and the age of the patient.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional.  The information above is a summary, and individual dosages should be determined by a physician considering the specific needs of each patient.  There are no specific dosage adjustments provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in current manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

*   Malaise (general discomfort)
*   Nausea
*   Increased thirst

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:

*   Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP): A rare but serious skin reaction.
*   Allergic skin reactions
*   Diplopia (double vision)

**If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Phloroglucinol is believed to act as a potent antimuscarinic agent. This means it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that triggers muscle contractions. By inhibiting acetylcholine's effects, phloroglucinol helps relax the smooth muscles causing the spasms, thus relieving pain and discomfort.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindication:** Phloroglucinol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to phloroglucinol or any components of the formulation.
*   **Pregnancy:** Phloroglucinol has been studied in pregnant women as an adjunct therapy for contractions, used in conjunction with other treatments.  However, its use should be carefully evaluated by a physician due to potential risks.
*   **Breastfeeding:** It is not known whether phloroglucinol is excreted in breast milk.  Therefore, its use in breastfeeding women should be avoided.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Although specific interactions are not extensively documented, it's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.
