# Promethazine + Dextromethorphan
### Generic Name
Promethazine + Dextromethorphan

### Usage
Promethazine and Dextromethorphan syrup is a combination medication used for the temporary relief of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms often associated with allergies or the common cold.  Promethazine is an antihistamine that helps reduce the symptoms of allergies, while dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant that helps to quiet a cough.  This combination aims to alleviate both the allergic response and the cough associated with these conditions.  It's important to note that this medication is for temporary relief and should not be used to treat underlying respiratory illnesses like asthma.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The following dosage information is for guidance only and should not replace the advice of a healthcare professional. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**  The usual dose is 5 mL (containing Promethazine 6.25 mg and Dextromethorphan 15 mg) every 4-6 hours.  The maximum daily dose is 30 mL.

**Children:** This medication is **contraindicated** (should not be used) in children under 2 years of age.  For children aged 2 to under 6 years, the dosage is typically 1.25-2.5 mL every 4-6 hours, with a maximum of 10 mL per day. Children aged 6 to under 12 years may take 2.5-5 mL every 4-6 hours, with a maximum of 20 mL per day. Children 12 years and older should follow the adult dosage.

### How it Works

Promethazine works by blocking histamine receptors in the body, which helps reduce allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itching. It also has some sedative properties. Dextromethorphan acts on the brain to suppress the cough reflex, reducing the urge to cough.  The combination works to tackle both the allergic response and the cough simultaneously.
