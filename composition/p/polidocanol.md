# Polidocanol
### Generic Name
Polidocanol

### Usage
Polidocanol is primarily used as a sclerosing agent to treat varicose veins.  Specifically, it's indicated for uncomplicated spider veins (those with a diameter of 1 mm or less) and uncomplicated reticular veins (1-3 mm in diameter) in the lower extremities.  It's also used to treat incompetent great saphenous veins, accessory saphenous veins, and visible varicosities associated with the great saphenous vein system, both above and below the knee.  The goal of treatment is to close off these affected veins, reducing symptoms and improving cosmetic appearance.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the type and size of the affected veins, as well as the form of Polidocanol used (solution or foam).  The information below is for guidance only and should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional.  They will determine the appropriate dosage based on your individual needs.

**Adults:**

* **Spider Veins (â‰¤1 mm):**  Intravenous injection of 1-0.3 mL of a 1% solution per injection. The maximum dose per session is 10 mL.  Repeat doses may be given 7-14 days apart.

* **Reticular Veins (1-3 mm):** Intravenous injection of 0.1-0.3 mL of a 0.5% solution per injection. The maximum dose per session is 10 mL.  Repeat doses may be given 7-14 days apart.

* **Great Saphenous & Accessory Saphenous Veins:**  Intravenous injection of Polidocanol foam. Up to 5 mL of a 1% solution per injection, with a maximum of 5 mL per injection and 15 mL per session.  Repeat doses can be given after at least 5 days.


**Children:**

The safety and effectiveness of Polidocanol in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  However, it's crucial to discuss any pre-existing conditions with your doctor before treatment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These are usually mild and localized to the injection site.

* Hematoma (bruising)
* Irritation
* Discoloration
* Pain
* Itching
* Warm sensation
* Venous thrombosis (blood clot) at the injection site


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

* Allergic dermatitis
* Anaphylactic shock
* Angioedema
* Asthma
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Circulatory shock
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Tissue necrosis (tissue death)
* Other serious adverse reactions


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Polidocanol is a sclerosing agent.  This means it causes inflammation and damage to the lining of the veins.  This damage triggers a process where platelets (blood clotting cells) accumulate at the site of injury, ultimately leading to the closure of the affected vein.  Over time, the closed-off vein is replaced by scar tissue.  This process effectively eliminates the varicose vein.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Polidocanol is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to Polidocanol or its components, acute thromboembolic disease (blood clots in the blood vessels), or thrombophilia (a predisposition to blood clots).

* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), arterial embolism (stroke, heart attack), tissue ischemia (lack of blood flow), and necrosis (tissue death).

* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with reduced mobility, a history of DVT or PE, recent major surgery, or prolonged hospitalization.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the use of Polidocanol with their doctor as the safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment take?** A:  The duration of treatment varies depending on the extent of the varicose veins and may involve multiple sessions.

* **Q: How long will the results last?** A: The results of Polidocanol treatment are generally long-lasting, but new varicose veins can develop over time.

* **Q: What should I avoid after treatment?** A: Avoid heavy exercise, sunbathing, long flights, hot baths, and saunas for a period of time following treatment (the specific duration will be advised by your doctor).  Maintain compression as directed by your doctor.

* **Q: Is Polidocanol safe?** A:  While generally safe, Polidocanol carries potential risks like any medication.  It's crucial to discuss potential side effects and contraindications with your doctor before treatment.

* **Q: How should I store Polidocanol?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Polidocanol is typically administered by a healthcare professional, so there's no concept of "missing a dose" in the home setting.  If you have concerns, contact your doctor.
