# Polyethylene Glycol 4000
### Generic Name
Polyethylene Glycol 4000

### Usage
Polyethylene Glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) is primarily used as an osmotic laxative to treat constipation.  It works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and increasing its bulk, making bowel movements easier.  While its primary use is for constipation in adults and children, it may also be used in bowel preparation before certain medical procedures.  In children, it can be used for fecal impaction, requiring a longer course of treatment for disimpaction and then a maintenance dose to prevent recurrence.


### Dosage

**Adults (Constipation):** The typical oral dose is 10-20 grams per day (this often equates to one or two sachets, depending on the product formulation).  It's generally recommended to take the dose in the morning.  Some individuals may find that 10 grams every other day is sufficient.

**Children (Constipation, â‰¥8 years):**  The dose is similar to adults, 10-20 grams daily (or one or two sachets), preferably in the morning.  Again, a lower dose (10 grams every other day) may be effective for some children.

**Children and Adolescents (Fecal Impaction):**  For fecal impaction, a higher dose of 1-1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight is given daily for 3-6 consecutive days. This is followed by a lower maintenance dose of 0.4 grams per kilogram daily for at least two months to prevent recurrence.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by the healthcare professional.

**Administration:**  Powdered PEG 4000 is typically dissolved in a glass of water (approximately 125 ml) before consumption. It's advisable to drink an additional 125 ml of liquid after taking the dose.  Take the medication at least two hours before or after other medications to avoid affecting their absorption.

### How it Works
PEG 4000 is an osmotic laxative. This means it works by increasing the amount of water in the intestines.  It's not absorbed into the body, instead, it draws water into the stool, making it softer and bulkier. This increased bulk stimulates bowel movements and relieves constipation.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Known allergy to polyethylene glycol or any components of the formulation.
* Severe inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease).
* Toxic megacolon, symptomatic bowel stenosis, or bowel obstruction.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in elderly patients, those with impaired liver or kidney function, and individuals taking diuretics.
*  Avoid using PEG 4000 during pregnancy unless other treatments have proven ineffective.
*  The effect on breastfeeding infants is unknown, but given the low systemic absorption, it's generally considered safe to use while breastfeeding.
*  Prolonged or excessive use can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.  Always follow the prescribed dosage.
*  PEG 4000 may interact with certain medications, including digoxin, potentially reducing their effectiveness.

### FAQs
