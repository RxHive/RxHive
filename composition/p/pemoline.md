# Pemoline
### Generic Name
Pemoline

### Usage
Pemoline is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  However, it's crucial to note that due to a significant risk of severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity), pemoline has been withdrawn from the market in most countries.  It remains available only in a few regions, such as Japan, and its use is strictly limited.  Because of the serious risk of liver damage, it is rarely prescribed and only considered in exceptional circumstances when other ADHD treatments have been ineffective.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (for ADHD):**  The usual starting dose is 37.5 mg orally once daily in the morning.  The dosage is gradually increased at weekly intervals by 18.75 mg, up to a maximum daily dose of 112.5 mg.  However, the typical effective dose range lies between 56.25 mg and 75 mg daily.


**Pediatric Dosage (for ADHD):**  Pemoline is contraindicated in children under 6 years old. For children 6 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults, starting low and gradually increasing under strict medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Pemoline is contraindicated in individuals with hepatic (liver) impairment.  No dosage adjustment is specifically needed for those with renal (kidney) impairment, but caution is advised.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Loss of appetite
* Insomnia (trouble sleeping)
* Weight loss

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Increased irritability
* Mental depression
* Stomach ache

**Rare but Very Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients, but potentially life-threatening):**

* Dark urine
* Yellowing of the eyes or skin (jaundice)
* Seizures (convulsions)
* Hallucinations
* Nausea and vomiting
* Shortness of breath
* Wheezing or chest tightness
* Skin rash
* Sores or ulcers in the mouth
* Swollen or painful glands
* Uncontrolled movements of the eyes, tongue, lips, face, arms, or legs
* Unusual bleeding or bruising
* Unusual tiredness or fatigue

**Important:** Any of these side effects, especially the rare but serious ones, necessitate immediate medical attention.  Stop taking pemoline and contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
Pemoline is a CNS stimulant that acts as an indirect sympathomimetic agent. This means it increases the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, which influences alertness, attention, and energy levels.  The exact mechanism by which it improves ADHD symptoms isn't fully understood, but it's believed to increase the release of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, neurotransmitters crucial for focus and attention.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Pemoline is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to the drug
* Children under 6 years of age
* Tourette syndrome
* Psychosis
* Impaired liver function


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Severe Liver Damage (Hepatotoxicity):** This is a major concern with pemoline use.  It can cause life-threatening liver failure. Regular liver function tests are essential, and the drug should be discontinued immediately if any abnormalities are detected.  The potential benefits must be carefully weighed against this significant risk.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pemoline can interact dangerously with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and may lower the seizure threshold in individuals with epilepsy who are taking anti-epileptic drugs. Avoid concurrent use with these medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of pemoline during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  It should only be used if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks and only under strict medical supervision.
* **Other Precautions:** Exercise caution in individuals with bipolar disorder, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, insomnia, porphyria, or hypertension.


### FAQs
**Q: How long does it take for pemoline to work?**
A: The onset of effects varies, but improvement in ADHD symptoms may be noticeable within a few weeks of starting treatment. However, if there is no substantial improvement within three weeks of dose adjustment, treatment should be stopped.


**Q: How should I store pemoline?**
A: Store pemoline as directed on the prescription label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.
