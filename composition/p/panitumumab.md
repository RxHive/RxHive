# Panitumumab

**Generic Name:** Panitumumab

**Usage:**

Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat certain types of colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer.  Specifically:

* **Metastatic colorectal cancer:** It's used in combination with other medications or as a single agent for patients whose cancer has progressed after treatment with other therapies, particularly those whose tumors have a specific genetic characteristic (KRAS and NRAS wild-type).
* **Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN):** It's used in combination with other therapies for patients whose cancer has progressed after prior treatments.


**Side Effects:**

Panitumumab can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common side effects:**  These can include skin reactions (rash, acne-like eruptions, dry skin, itching, redness, pain, and inflammation), diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting.
* **Serious side effects:** These are less common but potentially life-threatening and require immediate medical attention. They include:
    * **Interstitial lung disease (ILD):**  Inflammation and scarring of the lungs. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain.
    * **Infections:**  Weakened immune system can increase susceptibility to infections.
    * **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis.
    * **Severe skin reactions:**  These can include blistering, peeling, and ulceration of the skin.
    * **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Changes in blood levels of electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, and calcium.


**How it Works:**

Panitumumab is a targeted therapy that works by blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  EGFR is a protein found on the surface of some cancer cells. By blocking EGFR, panitumumab inhibits the growth and spread of cancer cells that depend on this receptor for their survival and proliferation.  It's important to note that it only works on tumors that express EGFR and are KRAS/NRAS wild-type (meaning they don't have certain mutations in these genes).

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is panitumumab administered?**  A: It's administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How long will I be on panitumumab?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the response to therapy and the presence of side effects. Your oncologist will determine the appropriate treatment schedule.
* **Q: What are the precautions I should take while on panitumumab?** A: You should report any skin changes, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms to your doctor immediately.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, panitumumab can interact with other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of panitumumab?** A: Long-term effects can vary, and some side effects might persist even after treatment is stopped. Regular follow-up appointments with your oncologist are vital to monitor your health.
