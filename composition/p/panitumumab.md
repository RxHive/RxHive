# Panitumumab
### Generic Name
Panitumumab

### Usage

Panitumumab is a targeted therapy used primarily to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).  It's specifically indicated for patients with *wild-type RAS* mCRC, meaning their tumor cells do not have certain mutations in the KRAS or NRAS genes.  RAS testing is crucial before starting Panitumumab treatment.  Panitumumab works by blocking a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which plays a role in tumor growth. By inhibiting EGFR, Panitumumab helps slow or stop the cancer's progression.

Panitumumab can be used in two main ways:

* **First-line therapy:**  It can be given alongside other chemotherapy drugs like FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) to treat mCRC from the outset.
* **Second-line therapy:** It can be used as a single agent (alone) after the cancer has progressed despite prior treatment with chemotherapy regimens including fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.  

While primarily used for mCRC, the use of Panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) is considered off-label in certain situations.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The standard intravenous (IV) dose is 6 mg/kg every 14 days.  This applies both to monotherapy (Panitumumab alone) and when used in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  It's crucial to establish RAS wild-type status before initiating treatment; Panitumumab is not indicated for patients with RAS mutations or unknown RAS status.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Panitumumab in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, dose modifications may be needed based on the severity of side effects. For example, infusion reactions may require slowing down the infusion rate or stopping the treatment altogether.  Dose reductions are also implemented for specific dermatological toxicities, such as rash or skin reactions.  A healthcare provider will guide any necessary adjustments.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Skin toxicity (rash, acne, itching, etc.)
* Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels)
* Ocular toxicity (eye problems)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Cough
* Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe infusion reactions (bronchospasm, dyspnea, hypotension)
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia)
* Interstitial lung disease
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Severe dermatologic toxicity

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Panitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on cancer cells. EGFR is a protein that promotes cell growth and division.  By binding to EGFR, Panitumumab blocks the signals that stimulate cancer cell growth, ultimately leading to reduced tumor growth and spread. This effect is primarily seen in tumors with wild-type RAS; those with RAS mutations are often less responsive to EGFR inhibition.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Panitumumab is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to Panitumumab or any component of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:** Panitumumab may increase the levels/effects of certain drugs like aminolevulinic acid (systemic and topical), porfimer sodium, and verteporfin.  Discuss all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) with a healthcare provider before starting Panitumumab.

* **Warnings:** Panitumumab carries a risk of serious side effects, including severe skin reactions (dermatologic toxicities), infusion reactions, and other organ toxicities (ocular, pulmonary).  Careful monitoring for these side effects is essential.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Panitumumab is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It is recommended that women of childbearing age use effective contraception during and for at least two months after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during and for two months after treatment.

* **Older Adults:**  Patients over 65 years old receiving Panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX may have a higher risk of serious adverse events.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  While specific dosage adjustments aren't provided in the prescribing information, these conditions may affect how Panitumumab is metabolized and excreted. Close monitoring is necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is RAS status determined?** A: RAS status is determined through laboratory testing of a tumor biopsy sample.

* **Q: How is Panitumumab administered?** A: It's given intravenously (IV) over a period of time, usually 30-90 minutes depending on the dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.  They can provide guidance on managing side effects.

* **Q: How is Panitumumab stored?** A: Store it under refrigeration.  Specific storage instructions are provided on the product labeling.

* **Q: Can Panitumumab cure cancer?** A: Panitumumab is not a cure for cancer, but it can help manage the disease and improve survival outcomes.
