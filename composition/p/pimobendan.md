# Pimobendan
### Generic Name
Pimobendan

### Usage
Pimobendan is primarily used as an adjunct therapy in the management of moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure (CHF) in dogs.  It's not a cure for CHF but helps improve the heart's function and alleviate symptoms. This medication works by improving the heart's ability to pump blood more efficiently and by relaxing blood vessels, reducing the workload on the heart.  While primarily used for CHF, it may also be used under specific circumstances and veterinary guidance for other related cardiac conditions.  Always consult a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.

### Dosage
Dosage is highly variable and depends on the individual dog's weight, severity of CHF, and response to treatment.  A veterinarian will determine the appropriate dose.  Generally, for dogs with moderate-to-severe CHF, the oral dosage is 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg twice daily.  This can be adjusted based on the patient's response and monitored closely.  Pimobendan is typically administered orally, usually after food to minimize potential gastrointestinal upset.  The medication is not currently approved for use in cats or other animals.  **Never administer any medication to a pet without explicit instruction from a veterinarian.** Pediatric use (in dogs) requires careful veterinary consideration and is not standardized.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild but can include:

*   Dizziness or lightheadedness (in dogs)
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
*   Skin rash
*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
*   Weight gain
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

More serious side effects are rare but require immediate veterinary attention.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your veterinarian immediately.


### How it Works
Pimobendan's mechanism involves two primary actions:  It's a calcium sensitizer, meaning it increases the sensitivity of heart muscle cells to calcium, making contractions stronger and more efficient. It's also a phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) inhibitor.  By inhibiting PDE3, it helps relax blood vessels, reducing the resistance against which the heart must pump. This combined action improves blood flow, increases cardiac output (amount of blood pumped per minute), and reduces the symptoms of CHF.

### Precautions
Pimobendan is contraindicated (should not be used) in dogs with:

*   Hypersensitivity (allergy) to pimobendan
*   Stenotic valvular heart disease (narrowing of the heart valves)

Use with caution in dogs with:

*   Angina pectoris (chest pain)
*   Atrial or ventricular arrhythmias
*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
*   History of myocardial infarction (heart attack) or cardiac surgery within the previous 3 months
*   Hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment

The safety of pimobendan in pregnant or lactating dogs has not been fully established.  Consult your veterinarian before using this medication during pregnancy or lactation.
