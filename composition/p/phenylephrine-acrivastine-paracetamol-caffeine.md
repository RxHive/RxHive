# Phenylephrine + Acrivastine + Paracetamol + Caffeine

## Phenylephrine + Acrivastine + Paracetamol + Caffeine

**Generic Name:**  There isn't a single generic name for a combination of Phenylephrine, Acrivastine, Paracetamol (Acetaminophen), and Caffeine.  Each ingredient has its own generic name, and the product would be marketed under a brand name.

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used for the symptomatic relief of colds and flu.  The specific ingredients target different symptoms:

* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that helps relieve nasal congestion by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages.
* **Acrivastine:** An antihistamine that reduces allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).
* **Caffeine:** A stimulant that can enhance the effects of the other ingredients and provide additional alertness.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but common potential side effects include:

* **Phenylephrine:** Increased blood pressure, nervousness, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea.
* **Acrivastine:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Rarely serious side effects at recommended doses. Liver damage is possible with overdose.
* **Caffeine:** Restlessness, anxiety, insomnia, increased heart rate, headache, stomach upset.


**How it Works:**

* **Phenylephrine:** Acts as a sympathomimetic, stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels to constrict them, reducing nasal congestion.
* **Acrivastine:** Blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and causing allergy symptoms.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus and reduces pain through a mechanism that is not fully understood.
* **Caffeine:**  Acts as a central nervous system stimulant, possibly enhancing the effectiveness of the other ingredients and increasing alertness.
