# Pitavastatin + Ezetimibe

**Generic Name:** Pitavastatin Calcium + Ezetimibe

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to lower cholesterol and other fatty substances (lipids) in the blood.  It's prescribed for patients with high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) who haven't achieved their cholesterol goals with pitavastatin or ezetimibe alone.  It is typically used in conjunction with diet and exercise.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Pitavastatin Calcium + Ezetimibe can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects can include:

* **Muscle aches and pains (myalgia):** This is a relatively common side effect of statins like pitavastatin, and may range from mild discomfort to severe muscle pain (myopathy) or muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) in rare cases.  This requires immediate medical attention.
* **Headache:**
* **Diarrhea:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Abdominal pain:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Back pain:**
* **Upper respiratory tract infection:**
* **Increased liver enzymes (rare, requires monitoring):**  Liver function tests are often monitored while taking this medication.


**Serious side effects are rare but possible and include:**

* **Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown):**  This is a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.  Symptoms include severe muscle pain, weakness, and dark urine.
* **Liver damage:**  Liver function tests will be monitored regularly.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  Symptoms include severe abdominal pain.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms such as rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing require immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

* **Pitavastatin Calcium:** This is a statin, a type of medication that works by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is involved in the production of cholesterol in the liver. By inhibiting this enzyme, pitavastatin reduces the amount of cholesterol your liver produces.

* **Ezetimibe:** This medication works by blocking the absorption of cholesterol from the food you eat in your intestines.  This further reduces the amount of cholesterol entering your bloodstream.

The combination of these two mechanisms allows for a more significant reduction in cholesterol levels than either drug alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of liver damage, so moderate alcohol intake or abstinence is recommended while on this medication.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I take this medication if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or plan to breastfeed.

* **Q:  What are the signs of muscle problems?** A:  Muscle pain, weakness, tenderness, or dark urine are signs of potential muscle problems and require immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How often do I need blood tests?** A: Your doctor will determine the frequency of blood tests to monitor your cholesterol levels and liver function.
