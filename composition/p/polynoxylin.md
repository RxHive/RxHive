# Polynoxylin
### Generic Name
Polynoxylin

### Usage
Polynoxylin is a topical antiseptic agent primarily used for the treatment of minor skin infections.  It was employed to help prevent or treat minor cuts, scrapes, burns, and other superficial wounds susceptible to bacterial or fungal infection.  Its use was largely restricted to topical application and it was not intended for internal use.  It is important to note that Polynoxylin has been discontinued from the market and is no longer readily available.

### Dosage
As Polynoxylin is no longer available, specific dosage information is not applicable.  However, historically, it was typically used as a 10% solution applied directly to the affected area.  The precise amount and frequency of application would depend on the size and severity of the wound, and the healthcare provider's instructions should always be followed.  Different formulations may have existed, such as creams or ointments, but the concentration would usually remain around 10%.  Specific instructions for children or adults were not generally differentiated other than appropriate care for the size and sensitivity of the treatment area.


### Side Effects
Since Polynoxylin is no longer available, experiencing side effects is not currently possible. However, potential side effects, if it were still available, may have included:

* Irritation at the application site (redness, burning, itching)
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Skin dryness


Serious side effects were uncommon but could include severe allergic reactions requiring immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Polynoxylin's antiseptic action stems from its decomposition into formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a known antimicrobial agent that disrupts the function of bacterial and fungal cells, thereby inhibiting their growth and preventing further infection.

### Precautions
As Polynoxylin is discontinued, these precautions are for historical reference only.  Previously, precautions included:

* **Avoid contact with eyes:** If contact occurs, flush thoroughly with water.
* **Allergic reactions:** Discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of Polynoxylin during pregnancy or breastfeeding was not generally recommended without explicit consultation with a healthcare provider to weigh the benefits and risks.
* **Open wounds:** Use only on minor wounds, avoid deep wounds or significant burns.
* **Children:** Use with caution in children and only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Drug interactions:** Although rare, potential interactions with other topical medications could have occurred; consultation with a doctor or pharmacist was recommended.
