# Pyrimethamine

**Generic Name:** Pyrimethamine

**Usage:** Pyrimethamine is an antimalarial medication primarily used in combination with other drugs, most commonly sulfadoxine, to prevent and treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, *Plasmodium vivax*, *Plasmodium ovale*, and *Plasmodium malariae*.  It's also used in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection, often in individuals with weakened immune systems like those with HIV/AIDS.  Specific dosages and treatment regimens vary significantly depending on the infection and patient factors, and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**  Side Effects can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea.
* **Headache:** Frequent and sometimes severe.
* **Bone marrow suppression:** This is a serious side effect that can lead to decreased blood cell counts (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia).  Regular blood tests are often required during treatment.
* **Skin reactions:** Rashes, itching.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired and weak.
* **Neurological effects:**  In rare cases, seizures or other neurological symptoms.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, severe allergic reactions can occur.


**How it Works:** Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist. It works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme essential for the synthesis of folic acid (folate) in parasites.  Folic acid is vital for DNA synthesis and cell division. By blocking the production of folate, pyrimethamine prevents the parasite from multiplying and ultimately helps to clear the infection.  Because humans also require folate, the combination with sulfadoxine (which inhibits another enzyme in the folate pathway) is crucial to minimize side effects while maintaining sufficient anti-parasitic effect.

**FAQs:**

* **Is pyrimethamine safe during pregnancy?** No, pyrimethamine is generally contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to its potential for causing birth defects.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered in exceptional
