# Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine + Sodium Citrate + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol (Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region)

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used for the symptomatic relief of the common cold and flu.  It targets several symptoms simultaneously:

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever (antipyretic) and relieves mild to moderate pain (analgesic).
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Relieves runny nose and sneezing (antihistamine).
* **Phenylephrine:** Relieves nasal congestion (decongestant).
* **Sodium Citrate & Ammonium Chloride:** Act as expectorants, helping to loosen and thin mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.
* **Menthol:** Provides a cooling sensation, potentially offering some relief from nasal congestion and cough.

It's important to note that this combination does *not* cure the underlying illness (cold or flu), only alleviates the symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:**  Especially from chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:** From antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Nausea:**  Less common.
* **Headache:**  Can occur from medication or the underlying illness.
* **Dizziness:** Particularly with phenylephrine.
* **Insomnia:**  If taken too late in the day.
* **Constipation:** Possible with some formulations.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, allergic reactions can occur.  Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like rash, hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

Each ingredient works through a different mechanism:

* **Paracetamol:**  Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus (the body's temperature control center) and relieves pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine which is released during allergic reactions causing runny nose and sneezing.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and relieving congestion.
* **Sodium Citrate & Ammonium Chloride:** Increase fluid secretion in the respiratory tract, thinning mucus and promoting expectoration.
* **Menthol:**  Works locally to create a cooling sensation, potentially providing some relief from congestion and cough through its effect on sensory nerves.
