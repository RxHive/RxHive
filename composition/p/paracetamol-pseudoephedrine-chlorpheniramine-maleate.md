# Paracetamol + Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold or flu, including:

* **Fever:** Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever.
* **Nasal Congestion:** Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Runny Nose/Sneezing/Itching Eyes/Watery Eyes:** Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, reducing these symptoms.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage, but common ones include:

* **Nervousness, restlessness, or anxiety:** More common with pseudoephedrine.
* **Drowsiness or dizziness:** More common with chlorpheniramine.
* **Dry mouth, nose, and throat:**  Common with both pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine.
* **Headache:** Can be caused by any of the components.
* **Insomnia:** Particularly with pseudoephedrine, if taken late in the day.
* **Nausea or vomiting:** Less common.
* **Constipation:** Less common.
* **Increased heart rate or blood pressure:** More likely with pseudoephedrine, particularly in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, symptoms like rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that regulates body temperature.  It also has mild analgesic (pain-relieving) effects.  The exact mechanism of its analgesic action is not fully understood.

* **Pseudoephedrine:** A sympathomimetic amine that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and congestion, making breathing easier.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine. Histamine causes symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, itchy and watery eyes.  By blocking histamine, chlorpheniramine reduces these allergic symptoms.
