# Pitavastatin + Fenofibrate
### Generic Name
Pitavastatin + Fenofibrate

**Note:**  Pitavastatin and fenofibrate are typically prescribed as separate medications, not as a fixed-dose combination.  While some formulations might exist in specific regions,  a combined pitavastatin and fenofibrate product is not widely available or standardized globally. This information will therefore address each drug individually, highlighting their potential combined use and implications.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific dosage and safety information concerning any prescription medication.


### Usage

**Pitavastatin:**  This medication is a statin used primarily to lower high cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolemia) in the blood.  It's particularly beneficial for people with high levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol and those at risk of cardiovascular disease.  It may be used alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering therapies.

**Fenofibrate:** This medication belongs to a class of drugs called fibrates. Its primary use is to lower high levels of triglycerides (another type of fat) in the blood. It can also raise levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol. Fenofibrate is often used in people with high triglycerides, especially those with a condition called hypertriglyceridemia. It's sometimes prescribed alongside statins to further improve lipid profiles in individuals at high cardiovascular risk.

**Combined Use:** The combined use of pitavastatin and fenofibrate aims to comprehensively address abnormal lipid levels, targeting both high LDL cholesterol and high triglycerides. This approach is typically considered for individuals with significantly elevated levels of both, posing a considerable cardiovascular risk.


### Dosage

Dosage for both pitavastatin and fenofibrate are highly individualized and depend on several factors, including age, overall health, other medications, and the severity of the lipid abnormalities.  There is no standard combined dosage as they are usually prescribed separately. A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage for each drug.

**Pitavastatin:**  Dosage typically ranges from 1 to 4 mg daily, taken orally.

**Fenofibrate:** Dosage varies depending on the formulation (e.g., micronized fenofibrate). It can range from 134 mg to 200 mg daily, taken orally.  

**Important Note:**  Never adjust the dosage of either medication without consulting your doctor.  Taking more than prescribed could lead to serious side effects.


### Side Effects

**Pitavastatin:** Common side effects are generally mild and can include:

* Muscle aches (myalgia)
* Headache
* Digestive upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhea)
* Elevated liver enzymes (rare but requires monitoring)
*  Increased risk of type 2 diabetes (rare)

**Fenofibrate:** Common side effects include:

* Digestive upset (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain)
* Muscle pain or weakness (myopathy, rhabdomyolysis- a serious but rare side effect)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Gallstones (cholelithiasis)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (for both):**  Muscle pain, weakness, or tenderness warrant immediate medical attention, especially if accompanied by fever, dark urine, or unexplained fatigue (possible sign of rhabdomyolysis).  Unexplained jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) or significant liver enzyme elevation requires immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

**Pitavastatin:**  It inhibits an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol synthesis in the liver.  By inhibiting this enzyme, pitavastatin reduces the production of cholesterol, leading to lower LDL cholesterol levels in the blood.

**Fenofibrate:** It activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which are proteins that regulate the expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism.  Activation of PPARs leads to decreased production of triglycerides, increased breakdown of triglycerides, and increased HDL cholesterol levels.


### Precautions

**Pitavastatin:**

* **Contraindications:**  Severe liver disease or active liver disease.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Known allergy to pitavastatin or other statins.
* **Interactions:**  Certain medications (e.g., some antibiotics, antifungals) can interact with pitavastatin.  Grapefruit juice can increase blood levels of pitavastatin.
* **Warnings:** Regular monitoring of liver enzymes is necessary.  Muscle pain should be reported immediately.  Increased risk of type 2 diabetes.


**Fenofibrate:**

* **Contraindications:** Severe liver or kidney disease.  Gallbladder disease.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding. Known allergy to fenofibrate.
* **Interactions:**  Interactions with certain blood thinners and other medications are possible.  
* **Warnings:**  Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and blood lipid levels is necessary.  Muscle problems should be reported immediately.  Increased risk of gallstones.


Both medications should be used cautiously in older adults and those with pre-existing kidney or liver conditions.
