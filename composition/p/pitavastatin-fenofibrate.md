# Pitavastatin + Fenofibrate

**Generic Name:** Pitavastatin/Fenofibrate Combination (Note:  A single, FDA-approved generic combination pill of pitavastatin and fenofibrate does not currently exist. This information describes the combined use of these two drugs, which may be prescribed separately and taken together.)

**Usage:** This combination is used to treat patients with high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (fats) in the blood, specifically those who haven't achieved adequate control with statin therapy alone.  It's often prescribed for individuals with mixed dyslipidemia (high LDL, high triglycerides, and low HDL cholesterol) or severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly those at high risk for cardiovascular disease.  The physician will determine the appropriate dosages of each medication based on individual patient needs and response.  It's crucial to note that this combination is not a first-line treatment for dyslipidemia.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosages of each drug.  Possible side effects include:

* **Pitavastatin:** Muscle aches (myalgia), muscle weakness, elevated liver enzymes, headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation.  Rarely, rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown) can occur.
* **Fenofibrate:**  Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, gallstones, elevated liver enzymes, myalgia.  Rarely, pancreatitis.

Combining pitavastatin and fenofibrate may increase the risk of some side effects, especially muscle problems (myopathy/rhabdomyolysis) and liver problems. Regular monitoring of liver function and muscle enzymes is crucial.

**How it Works:**

* **Pitavastatin:** This is a statin medication that works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis in the liver.  This leads to a reduction in LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels and increases in HDL ("good") cholesterol levels.
* **Fenofibrate:** This is a fibrate medication that works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-Î±). This action primarily lowers triglyceride levels and raises HDL cholesterol.  It can also modestly lower LDL cholesterol.

The combination therapy leverages the different mechanisms of action of each drug to provide a more comprehensive approach to lowering lipid levels than either drug alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this combination always better than using just one drug?** A: No.  This combination is only used when lifestyle modifications and monotherapy have proven insufficient.  The potential increased risk of side effects needs to be carefully weighed against the benefits.

* **Q: How often do I need blood tests?** A: Your doctor will order blood tests to monitor your liver function and muscle enzymes (CK levels) regularly, particularly in the early stages of treatment and at intervals determined by your physician.

* **Q: What are the interactions with other medications?** A: Both pitavastatin and fenofibrate can interact with other medications, including some blood thinners, certain antibiotics, and other lipid-lowering drugs.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this combination?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can increase liver damage risk, so moderation is advised.  You should discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience muscle pain?** A: Report muscle pain or weakness to your doctor immediately.  This is crucial as it can be a sign of serious muscle damage.
