# Propranolol
### Generic Name
Propranolol

### Usage
Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's also effective in managing angina pectoris (chest pain due to coronary artery disease), atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), and myocardial infarction (heart attack, both early treatment and secondary prevention).  Beyond cardiovascular conditions, propranolol finds use in managing migraine headaches (prophylaxis), essential tremor, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), and proliferating infantile hemangioma (a type of benign tumor in infants).  It also has some off-label uses, such as treating performance anxiety and certain types of tachycardia (rapid heartbeats).


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the specific formulation (immediate-release or extended-release tablets, intravenous injection).  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The following are examples and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension (as an alternative agent):** Oral, immediate-release or extended-release: Initial dose 80 mg/day, titrated upwards at intervals of at least one week as needed, to a usual range of 80-160 mg/day.
* **Angina Pectoris (as an alternative agent):** Oral, immediate-release or extended-release: Initial dose 80 mg/day, increased as tolerated to a usual range of 80-320 mg/day.
* **Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter (acute ventricular rate control):** IV: 1 mg over 1 minute, repeated every 2 minutes as needed up to a maximum of 3 doses.  (Maintenance: Oral, immediate-release: 30-160 mg/day divided into 3-4 doses).
* **Essential Tremor:** Oral, immediate-release or extended-release: Initial dose 60-80 mg/day, increased as needed, to a usual range of 60-320 mg/day.
* **Migraine (prophylaxis):** Oral, immediate-release or extended-release: Initial dose 40-80 mg/day, gradually increased to a usual range of 40-160 mg/day.
* **Myocardial Infarction:** Oral, immediate-release: Initial dose 60-120 mg/day divided into 2-3 doses, titrated up to 240 mg/day as tolerated.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosing is complex and highly dependent on the specific condition, age, and weight of the child.  It should *always* be determined and supervised by a pediatrician.  Examples include:

* **Essential Tremor:** 0.5-1 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses (maximum 4 mg/kg/day).
* **Proliferating Infantile Hemangioma:**  Dosing starts at 0.6 mg/kg twice daily and is carefully titrated upwards under close medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, though specific guidelines aren't always provided in manufacturer labeling.  Caution is advised in such cases.

### Side Effects

**Common (incidence >10%):**

* Sleep disorders
* Bronchiolitis (in infants) and bronchitis

**Less Common (incidence 1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Agitation, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, irritability, nightmares
* Cardiovascular: Cold extremities
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, decreased appetite, diarrhea

**Serious but Less Common (<1%):**

* Second-degree atrioventricular block (especially in infants or those with underlying conduction disorders)
* Alopecia (hair loss) and urticaria (hives)
* Nausea


**Other reported side effects:**  A wide range of other side effects have been reported, including those impacting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and nervous systems.  Some are serious and may require immediate medical attention.


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker. This means it blocks the effects of the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine at both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors in the body.  Beta-1 receptors are predominantly found in the heart, and their blockage leads to a slower heart rate and reduced force of contraction. Beta-2 receptors are found in the lungs and blood vessels, and their blockage can cause constriction of the airways and blood vessels. This mechanism helps reduce blood pressure, heart rate, and the oxygen demand of the heart, which is beneficial in treating various cardiovascular conditions.  In conditions like essential tremor, propranolol's effect on the nervous system helps reduce tremor severity.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Propranolol is contraindicated in several conditions, including uncompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, severe heart block, bronchial asthma, and hypersensitivity to propranolol or its components.
* **Interactions:** Propranolol can interact with many other medications, including other heart medications, diabetes medications, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Propranolol is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  Its use should be carefully considered and only prescribed if the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. It's excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should monitor their infants closely for side effects.
* **Sudden Discontinuation:** Abrupt discontinuation of propranolol, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease, can lead to serious consequences like angina exacerbation or myocardial infarction.  Always taper the dose gradually under medical supervision.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use caution in patients with diabetes, liver or kidney problems, peripheral vascular disease, and those prone to hypoglycemia.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking propranolol suddenly?**  A: No, never stop taking propranolol suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can be dangerous and may lead to serious complications.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking propranolol?**  A:  While there is no absolute contraindication, alcohol can interact with propranolol, potentially intensifying its side effects.  Limit your alcohol intake while taking this medication.
* **Q: How should I store propranolol?** A: Store propranolol as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.
* **Q: Is propranolol addictive?**  A: No, propranolol is not considered an addictive medication.
