# Plecanatide
### Generic Name
Plecanatide

### Usage
Plecanatide is a medication used to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adults.  Chronic idiopathic constipation is a condition where constipation occurs frequently without any identifiable underlying medical cause. Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation is a disorder of the bowel characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, and infrequent bowel movements.  Plecanatide works by increasing bowel movements and easing the discomfort associated with these conditions.


### Dosage
**Adults (Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation):** The usual dose is 3 mg once daily, taken orally.  The tablet can be swallowed whole or crushed and mixed with applesauce or water.  Instructions for crushing and administration are provided below.

**Children:** Plecanatide is contraindicated (should not be used) in children under 6 years old due to the risk of serious dehydration.  Its use is also not recommended for children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years as safety and effectiveness have not been established in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are needed for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, as absorption into the bloodstream is low.  However, it's always recommended to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Abdominal distension (bloating)
* Abdominal tenderness
* Diarrhea
* Flatulence (gas)
* Nausea
* Increased serum ALT and AST levels (liver enzymes)
* Urinary tract infection

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** While less frequent, severe diarrhea and dehydration are potential concerns, especially in children.  Vomiting, pruritus (itching), skin rash, and urticaria (hives) have also been reported post-marketing.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe diarrhea or dehydration, discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Plecanatide is a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist. This means it works by activating GC-C receptors located on the lining of the intestines.  This activation increases the levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a molecule that helps increase fluid secretion into the intestines.  This increased fluid softens the stool, making bowel movements easier and more frequent.  In addition, the increased cGMP also appears to reduce the activity of pain-sensing nerves in the gut, potentially alleviating abdominal discomfort.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Plecanatide is contraindicated in patients younger than 6 years old and in those with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction (blockage).

**Warnings:** There is an increased risk of diarrhea and serious dehydration, particularly in children.  Plecanatide should be used with caution in patients with a history of diarrhea or dehydration.

**Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Plecanatide during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
