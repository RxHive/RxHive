# Prilocaine
### Generic Name
Prilocaine

### Usage
Prilocaine is a local anesthetic primarily used in dentistry.  It's employed for both infiltration and nerve block techniques to achieve local anesthesia during dental procedures.  Beyond dentistry, prilocaine finds application in inducing local and regional anesthesia through infiltration techniques and intravenous regional blocks (Bier's block) in the upper and lower extremities.  This latter use is typically for procedures involving the hands or feet where a larger area of anesthesia is required.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Local Dental Anesthesia (4% solution):**  The initial dose for infiltration or conduction block is typically 40-80 mg (1-2 mL).  Maximum recommended dose within a 2-hour period: 6 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) for patients weighing less than 70 kg, and 400 mg (or 5-6 cartridges) for patients weighing 70 kg or more.

* **Local and Regional Anesthesia (0.5% solution):**  Infiltration typically involves a dose of 400 mg (80 mL), with a maximum dose of 6 mg/kg per dose. For intravenous regional blocks (Bier's block): 200-300 mg (40-60 mL) for upper extremities and 300-400 mg (60-80 mL) for lower extremities.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children requires careful consideration and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  For local dental anesthesia in children under 10 years of age, doses exceeding 40 mg (1 mL) per procedure are rarely necessary.  Children 10 years and older generally follow the adult dosage guidelines.  For local and regional anesthesia in infants (over 6 months), children, and adolescents using a 0.5% solution, the lowest effective dose should be used, calculated based on ideal body weight, with a maximum of 5 mg/kg per dose, not exceeding 400 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment; however, caution is advised due to prilocaine's metabolism in both the liver and kidneys.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Localized warm feeling, numbness, slight dizziness.

* **Less Common but Serious:**  Methemoglobinemia (a serious blood disorder), cardiovascular effects (bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrest), respiratory depression or arrest, seizures, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), neurological effects (confusion, convulsions, drowsiness).  Oral paresthesia (numbness or tingling in the mouth) may be persistent.

**Important:**  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Prilocaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking sodium channels in nerve cells. Sodium channels are responsible for transmitting nerve impulses. By blocking these channels, prilocaine prevents the transmission of pain signals to the brain, resulting in local anesthesia.  This effect is reversible; once the drug diffuses away from the nerve, the sodium channels regain their function, and sensation returns.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Prilocaine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to amide-type local anesthetics or any formulation component, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, and in cases of severe shock, heart block, or infection at the injection site (for 4% solution).  Infection at the injection site is also a contraindication for the 0.5% solution.

* **Interactions:**  Concomitant use with sulfonamides, antimalarials, certain nitrates, or other structurally related local anesthetics should be avoided due to potential additive toxic effects or increased risk of methemoglobinemia.  Use with antiarrhythmics may increase the risk of myocardial depression.

* **Warnings:** Increased risk of CNS toxicity, methemoglobinemia, respiratory arrest, and convulsions (potentially leading to cardiac arrest) exists.  Caution is necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal impairment, the elderly, debilitated individuals, acutely ill patients, and children.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful evaluation by a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does prilocaine anesthesia last?** A: The duration of anesthesia varies depending on the concentration used, the injection site, and the individual patient.  It can range from several minutes to several hours.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving prilocaine?** A: Driving should be avoided until the effects of the anesthesia have completely worn off and you feel fully alert and able to react normally.

* **Q: How should I store prilocaine?** A:  Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature, away from direct light and moisture.  Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or dentist immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, especially those listed above.
