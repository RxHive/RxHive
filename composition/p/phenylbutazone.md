# Phenylbutazone
### Generic Name
Phenylbutazone

### Usage
Phenylbutazone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for the symptomatic treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.  It's reserved for situations where other, less toxic treatments have proven ineffective.  This is because phenylbutazone carries a significant risk of serious side effects.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is not a first-line treatment for this condition due to its potential for toxicity.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Ankylosing Spondylitis):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is typically 400-600 mg per day, divided into multiple administrations, for the first 48 hours.  This is then reduced to 200-300 mg per day, also divided, as a maintenance dose.  The lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should always be used.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Phenylbutazone is not recommended for use in children under 14 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for mild to moderate impairment; however, caution is advised.  Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication for use.
* **Renal Impairment:** Similar to hepatic impairment, the manufacturer's labeling does not offer specific dosage adjustments for mild to moderate renal impairment; use with caution is recommended.  The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest discontinuing NSAIDs in individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m² and any coexisting condition that increases the risk of acute kidney injury. Severe renal impairment contraindicates its use.

### Side Effects

Phenylbutazone can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others rare but serious.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any adverse effects.

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these is not precisely defined in available literature.

* Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, malaise.
* Gastrointestinal:  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia.

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Blood disorders: Agranulocytosis (severe reduction in white blood cells), aplastic anemia (failure of bone marrow to produce blood cells), hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
* Liver damage: Hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests.
* Kidney damage: Acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome.
* Allergic reactions: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reactions).
* Cardiovascular problems: Congestive heart failure, hypertension.


This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Consult your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual symptoms.

### How it Works

Phenylbutazone reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to inflammation and pain.  However, phenylbutazone has a greater affinity for COX-1 than COX-2.  It also interferes with platelet aggregation, affecting blood clotting.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Phenylbutazone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components; a history of asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs; peptic ulcers; a history of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation; inflammatory bowel disease; blood dyscrasias; hemorrhagic disorders; severe heart or hepatic failure; renal failure; pulmonary impairment, edema, or hypertension; thyroid disease; Sjögren's syndrome; and during the third trimester of pregnancy.
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of blood dyscrasias, cardiovascular thrombotic events (including myocardial infarction and stroke), CNS depression, aseptic meningitis, acute bronchospasm, impaired female fertility, hepatic effects, renal effects, serious skin reactions (SJS and TEN), and gastrointestinal reactions (bleeding, ulceration, perforation).
* **Interactions:** Phenylbutazone can interact with anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and other NSAIDs, increasing the risk of bleeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, high cardiovascular risk, edema, a history of GI disease, bronchial asthma, the elderly, and those with hepatic or renal impairment.  It's contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and should be avoided during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store phenylbutazone?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking phenylbutazone?** A: It's generally advised to avoid alcohol during treatment.
* **Q: Can I drive while on this medication?** A:  Because phenylbutazone can cause drowsiness, it is best to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.
