# Polymyxin B
### Generic Name
Polymyxin B

### Usage

Polymyxin B is a polypeptide antibiotic primarily used to treat severe bacterial infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, particularly those resistant to other antibiotics.  Its main applications include treating acute infections of the urinary tract, meninges (the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), and bloodstream (bacteremia).  It's also employed in treating serious infections such as meningeal infections, urinary tract infections, and sepsis, especially when caused by multidrug-resistant organisms like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Acinetobacter* species.  While not its primary use, Polymyxin B may be used topically or in other localized applications for skin infections, eye infections, and external ear infections.  The use of Polymyxin B is often reserved for situations where other antibiotics have failed.

### Dosage

Polymyxin B dosage is highly variable depending on the route of administration (intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM], intrathecal, topical, etc.), the severity of the infection, the patient's age and renal function, and the specific infection site.  Dosage is typically expressed in units, with 10,000 units being approximately equivalent to 1 mg.  **It is crucial to consult prescribing information and a healthcare professional for precise dosing instructions as self-medication can be dangerous.** The information below is for general knowledge only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.

**Adult Dosages (examples, not exhaustive):**

* **Systemic Infections (IV or IM):**  Doses range widely (15,000-30,000 units/kg/day) divided into multiple administrations per day, with adjustments based on renal function.  Maximum daily doses are usually defined.
* **Intrathecal Administration (spinal injection):**  Initial doses might be 50,000 units/day for several days, followed by lower maintenance doses on alternate days for several weeks.
* **Topical Applications:** Concentrations and application frequency (e.g., drops, ointments) vary significantly based on the location of the infection (eye, skin, ear).

**Pediatric Dosages (examples, not exhaustive):**

Pediatric dosing is also highly variable and significantly lower than adult doses, again based on factors like weight, age, and the infection's location and severity.  Intramuscular administration is less common in children due to pain at the injection site. Intravenous administration is preferred when possible.  Precise dosing must be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired renal function.  Lower doses are typically administered to individuals with reduced creatinine clearance (CrCl).  The specifics of these adjustments depend on the CrCl level and the route of administration.  Hepatic impairment usually does not necessitate dosage changes.

### Side Effects

Polymyxin B can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare but serious. It's essential to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Pain at the injection site (IM administration)
* Inflammation at the IV infusion site (phlebitis)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage):**  Symptoms can include decreased urine output, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.
* **Neurotoxicity (nerve damage):**  Symptoms may include dizziness, numbness, weakness, ataxia (loss of coordination), blurry vision, seizures, and respiratory paralysis.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:**  Allergic reactions ranging from mild rashes to life-threatening anaphylaxis.
* **Superinfections:**  Overgrowth of other bacteria or fungi due to the disruption of normal gut flora.


### How it Works

Polymyxin B is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by binding to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.  This binding disrupts the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, leading to leakage of essential cellular components and ultimately cell death.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Polymyxin B is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to polymyxins.
* **Renal Function:**  Patients with impaired kidney function are at increased risk of nephrotoxicity.  Dosage adjustments are crucial.
* **Neurotoxicity:** Individuals with neurological conditions are at higher risk of neurotoxicity.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Polymyxin B during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Use should be carefully considered and only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult with a doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Polymyxin B can interact with other nephrotoxic or neurotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, bacitracin), potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should be monitored for signs of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Polymyxin B to work?**  A: The onset of action varies depending on the infection site and administration route. Improvement may not be immediate.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Polymyxin B when I feel better?** A: No.  Complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if symptoms improve. Stopping early may lead to recurrence of the infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: How should I store Polymyxin B?** A:  Storage instructions vary depending on the formulation (e.g., injection, topical). Always follow the label instructions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not double the next dose.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Polymyxin B?** A:  Generally, no specific dietary restrictions are associated with Polymyxin B use. However, maintaining adequate hydration is important, especially if there are concerns about kidney function.
