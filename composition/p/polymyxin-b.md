# Polymyxin B

**Generic Name:** Polymyxin B

**Usage:** Polymyxin B is an antibiotic used topically (on the skin) and sometimes ophthalmically (in the eyes) to treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria.  It's often used in combination with other antibiotics, particularly for treating serious infections. Specific uses include:

* **Topical treatment of infected wounds and burns:**  Often used for skin infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria.
* **Treatment of eye infections:**  Used in eye drops or ointments for infections like conjunctivitis (pink eye) caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Inhaled medication (rare):**  In some cases, it may be used as an inhaled medication for treating certain lung infections, but this is less common.


**Side Effects:** Polymyxin B is generally well-tolerated topically, but side effects can occur, particularly with prolonged use or if the medication enters the bloodstream (systemic absorption):

* **Topical application:**  Local irritation, redness, itching, burning, or pain at the application site.
* **Ophthalmic application:**  Eye irritation, burning, stinging.
* **Systemic effects (rare, but more likely with higher doses or intravenous administration):** Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), neurotoxicity (nerve damage â€“ potentially leading to numbness, tingling, weakness, seizures), and respiratory depression.


**How it Works:** Polymyxin B is a polypeptide antibiotic that works by binding to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.  This disrupts the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death.  It's bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria directly.  It is effective against many Gram-negative bacteria, but its effectiveness against Gram-positive bacteria is limited.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Polymyxin B an antibiotic or an antifungal?** Polymyxin B is an antibiotic, effective against bacteria, not fungi.
* **Can I use Polymyxin B without a doctor's prescription?**  Generally, topical polymyxin B preparations may be available over-the-counter for minor skin infections, but it's crucial to consult a doctor for any serious infections or if symptoms don't improve.  Ophthalmic and injectable forms require a prescription.
* **How long does it take to work?** The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the infection's severity and location. Improvement should be observed within a few days for topical applications.
* **Are there any drug interactions?** While relatively few, potential interactions exist.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking before starting Polymyxin B, especially other nephrotoxic drugs.
* **Is Polymyxin B safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  The safety of Polymyxin B during pregnancy and breastfeeding needs to be carefully evaluated by a doctor, as systemic absorption might pose risks. Topical use is generally considered safer than systemic administration.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Stop using the medication and contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe side effects, especially kidney or nerve problems.
