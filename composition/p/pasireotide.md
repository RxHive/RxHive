# Pasireotide
### Generic Name
Pasireotide

### Usage
Pasireotide is a medication primarily used to treat adults with acromegaly who haven't responded adequately to surgery or for whom surgery isn't an option.  Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder characterized by excessive growth hormone production, leading to various physical changes. Pasireotide also treats adult patients with Cushing's disease where pituitary surgery is unsuitable or hasn't been successful. Cushing's disease results from the overproduction of cortisol, causing a range of symptoms.  While not officially approved for these conditions, pasireotide has also been used off-label in some cases of carcinoid syndrome and metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of the digestive tract that are inadequately controlled by first-generation somatostatin analogs.


### Dosage

Pasireotide comes in two formulations: subcutaneous (subQ) injection and intramuscular (IM) injection.  Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated and the formulation used.  Precise dosing should always be determined and monitored by a physician.


**Cushing's Disease:**

* **Subcutaneous (diaspartate):** The initial dose is typically 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg twice daily (BID).  The dose is then adjusted based on the patient's response and tolerance.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 1.8 mg. If side effects occur, the dose may be temporarily reduced.

* **Intramuscular (pamoate):**  The initial dose is 10 mg once every 28 days.  In patients who don't achieve normalization of 24-hour urinary free cortisol after four months, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 40 mg once every 28 days.


**Acromegaly:**

* **Intramuscular (pamoate):** The starting dose is usually 40 mg once every 4 weeks (28 days).  If growth hormone (GH) and/or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels aren't normalized after three months, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 60 mg once every 28 days.


**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  The prescribing physician will tailor the dosage based on the severity of liver impairment.  Pasireotide is generally not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Renal (kidney) impairment typically doesn't require dosage adjustments.  Pediatric use is not established.


### Side Effects

Pasireotide can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.  It is crucial to report any adverse effects to your healthcare provider.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Anxiety, fatigue, headache, insomnia
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension, peripheral edema
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distension, abdominal pain, cholelithiasis (gallstones), decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea, upper abdominal pain
* Respiratory: Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Dermatologic: Alopecia (hair loss)
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, increased liver enzyme levels
* Hematologic: Elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, prolonged clotting times
* Hepatic: Increased serum ALT and AST levels
* Infection: Influenza
* Local: Injection-site reactions
* Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Asthenia (weakness), back pain, muscle pain


**Less Common, But Serious Side Effects:**

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* QT prolongation (on ECG)
* Atrioventricular block
* Pancreatitis
* Adrenocortical insufficiency
* Hypothyroidism
* Severe liver impairment
* Ketoacidosis (especially in those without a history of diabetes)


### How it Works

Pasireotide is a somatostatin analog. Somatostatin is a naturally occurring hormone that inhibits the release of several other hormones, including growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).  Pasireotide mimics the action of somatostatin by binding to various somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) in the body.  By binding to these receptors, especially SSTR5 in Cushing's disease, it reduces the production and release of growth hormone (in acromegaly) or ACTH (in Cushing's disease), leading to a decrease in the levels of growth hormone and cortisol, respectively.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Pasireotide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it, uncontrolled diabetes, severe heart failure, certain heart rhythm disorders (unless a pacemaker is present), or congenital long QT syndrome.

* **Drug Interactions:** Pasireotide may interact with other medications, particularly those that affect heart rhythm or liver function.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking.  Co-administration with cyclosporine may require cyclosporine dosage adjustments.  Combined use with bromocriptine may necessitate a bromocriptine dose reduction.

* **Warnings:** Pasireotide can increase the risk of gallstones, liver enzyme elevation, hyperglycemia, hypocortisolism, and hypothyroidism.  Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or diabetes should be carefully monitored.  Pregnancy and lactation require careful consideration and discussion with a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the condition and individual response. For Cushingâ€™s disease, significant cortisol reduction is usually observed within two months. For acromegaly, monitoring of GH and IGF-1 levels are essential to assess the treatment response.

* **Q: How should I store Pasireotide?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist or physician.  Storage conditions may differ based on the formulation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: For IM injections, the missed dose may be given up to 14 days before the next scheduled dose, but this should be discussed with the physician.  For SubQ injections, it's recommended to consult your physician for guidance on missed doses.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects?** A:  Long-term use may increase the risk of some side effects, particularly those related to endocrine function, liver health and gallstones.  Regular monitoring is important.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Pasireotide?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.  Alcohol could potentially interact with Pasireotide or worsen some side effects.
