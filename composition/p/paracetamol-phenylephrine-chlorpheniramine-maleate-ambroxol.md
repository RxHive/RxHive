# Paracetamol + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu.  It combines several active ingredients to target different symptoms:

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever and relieves mild to moderate pain.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
* **Ambroxol:** An expectorant that helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.

This medication is commonly used for symptoms including: headache, fever, body aches, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and cough with mucus.  It is important to note that it *treats symptoms*, not the underlying infection (like a virus).


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of both chlorpheniramine and sometimes paracetamol.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsy.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines like chlorpheniramine.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Headache:**  Paradoxical headache can occur, although it's usually less common than relief of headache.
* **Dizziness:** Particularly relevant with phenylephrine.
* **Constipation:**
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate:**  More likely with phenylephrine, especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.

**How it Works:**

Each ingredient works independently to target specific symptoms:

* **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus in the brain, and relieves pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that cause pain and inflammation.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and relieving congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions that contributes to cold and flu symptoms.
* **Ambroxol:**  Increases the production of surfactant in the lungs, helping to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
