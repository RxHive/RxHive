# Policresulen
### Generic Name
Policresulen

### Usage
Policresulen is an antiseptic with a broad range of applications. Its primary use is in treating inflammation and infection in the cervix and vagina.  It's also used to promote hemostasis (stop bleeding) after procedures like uterine polyp removal or tonsillectomy.  Other uses include treating oral mucosal and gingival inflammation (mouth sores and stomatitis), aiding healing after vaginal cauterization, and treating damaged skin to promote the removal of dead tissue and stimulate wound healing.  In essence, it's employed where antiseptic action, hemostasis, and wound healing are needed.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition and the form of Policresulen (solution or suppository):

**Adults:**

* **Vaginal/Cervical Inflammation or Infection:**
    * **Suppository:** One suppository intravaginally daily or every other day at bedtime.
    * **Solution (360 mg/g):** Swab the affected area once or twice weekly, gently pressing a soaked gauze for 1-3 minutes.

* **Hemostasis following Uterine Procedure:**
    * **Solution (360 mg/g):** Apply to the bleeding site with a soaked swab for 1-2 minutes.

* **Oral Inflammation (Mouth Sores, Stomatitis):**
    * **Solution (360 mg/g):** Apply with a soaked swab to the affected area.

* **Post-Cauterization Treatment (Vaginal):**
    * **Suppository:** After initial treatment with the solution, insert one suppository intravaginally every other day at bedtime between cauterizations.

* **Wound Healing and Hemostasis:**
    * **Solution (360 mg/g):** Apply to the bleeding area with a soaked swab for 1-2 minutes after drying the wound.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Policresulen in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Vulvovaginal burning
* **Less Common (Frequency Not Defined):**  Foreign body sensation, tooth enamel damage, vulvar itching (pruritus), hives (urticaria), vaginal discharge, vaginal discomfort, vaginal dryness, vaginal irritation, vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis),  anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).
* **Local Irritation:**  This is a possibility with any application site.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones like anaphylaxis or angioedema, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Policresulen is an organic acid that works by several mechanisms to promote healing:

* **Hemostasis:** It causes blood proteins to coagulate and constricts small blood vessels, thereby stopping bleeding.
* **Debridement:** It interacts with dead tissue, denaturing proteins and facilitating their removal, helping to clean the wound.
* **Antimicrobial Activity:** Its acidity and coagulating properties provide some antimicrobial effects against common bacteria (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus) and Candida albicans (a yeast).


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Policresulen is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Policresulen or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of local irritation and damage to tooth enamel (with oral use).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Avoid using Policresulen during pregnancy, especially endocervical swabbing and cervical cauterization.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, avoid use during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid irritant soaps and sexual intercourse during vaginal treatment. Do not use during menstruation. Avoid contact with eyes.  If swallowed accidentally, drink plenty of water immediately.  Removal of coagulated tissue clusters may be necessary to prevent further irritation.  Using Policresulen with latex or rubber contraceptive products may reduce their effectiveness. Some manufacturers advise against its use in postmenopausal women.
