# Palbociclib
### Generic Name
Palbociclib

### Usage

Palbociclib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It's used in combination with other therapies, not on its own.

Specifically, it's indicated as:

* **Initial endocrine-based therapy:**  Palbociclib is given in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (a drug that lowers estrogen levels) for postmenopausal women or men with this type of breast cancer.  This means it's used from the start of treatment for advanced disease.

* **Treatment after disease progression on endocrine therapy:**  If a patient's breast cancer progresses despite initial endocrine therapy, palbociclib may be used in combination with fulvestrant (another anti-estrogen medication).  In pre- or perimenopausal women, an LHRH agonist (a medication that reduces hormone production) might also be included.


### Dosage

Dosage information should always be confirmed with a healthcare professional as it depends on individual health and response to the treatment. The information provided here is for general understanding only.

**Adults:** The usual dose is 125 mg taken orally once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break. This 28-day cycle is repeated.  The specific combination therapy (e.g., with aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) will dictate the exact treatment schedule.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of palbociclib in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dose may need to be adjusted based on factors such as liver or kidney function, and the severity of side effects.  For instance, patients with severe liver impairment may need a reduced dose (75 mg daily).  Dose reductions are also common in managing side effects like low blood cell counts.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific guidance regarding dose adjustments.


### Side Effects

Palbociclib can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.  It's crucial to report any concerning symptoms to your healthcare provider.

**Common side effects (>10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Decreased appetite
* Constipation
* Skin rash
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Weakness
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Decreased lymphocyte count (a type of white blood cell)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Fever
* Infections
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in the extremities)
* Nosebleeds (epistaxis)
* Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs)


**Less common but serious side effects (can occur in 1-10% or less):**

* Febrile neutropenia (fever with low white blood cell count)
* Severe dry skin (xeroderma)
* Blurred vision
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)
* Dry eye syndrome
* Increased tearing
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)


### How it Works

Palbociclib works by blocking the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6).  These kinases are enzymes that play a vital role in the cell cycle, specifically the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase (DNA replication). By inhibiting CDK4/6, palbociclib slows down or stops the growth of cancer cells that depend on these kinases for their proliferation.  The combination with other anti-estrogen medications enhances this effect, leading to a greater reduction in tumor growth than either drug alone.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Palbociclib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** Palbociclib is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Therefore,  concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or inducers (e.g., rifampin) should be avoided or managed with dose adjustments.  Interaction with other medications is possible.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Palbociclib can be harmful to a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the final dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.  Older adults may have a higher risk of certain side effects and may require dose adjustments.  Kidney or liver problems may also require dosage modifications.

* **Monitoring:**  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor blood cell counts and liver function during palbociclib treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take palbociclib with food?** A: Tablets can be taken with or without food. Capsules should be taken with food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Simply resume your normal dosing schedule with the next dose.

* **Q: How should I store palbociclib?** A: Store palbociclib as directed on the prescription label.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of palbociclib?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential to manage potential side effects and adjust treatment as needed.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  Some side effects are manageable with adjustments to the treatment plan.
