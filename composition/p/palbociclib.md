# Palbociclib

**Generic Name:** Palbociclib

**Usage:** Palbociclib is an oral medication used in combination with other drugs to treat certain types of breast cancer.  Specifically, it's used in:

* **Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer:**  Usually in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (like letrozole or anastrozole) in postmenopausal women.
* **HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer:**  It may be used in combination with endocrine therapy after surgery in high-risk patients.

**Note:**  Palbociclib is always used *in combination* with other cancer treatments, not as a standalone therapy.  The specific combination and dosage will be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's condition.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, palbociclib can cause side effects.  The most common include:

* **Low white blood cell count (neutropenia):** This increases the risk of infection.
* **Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia):** This increases the risk of bleeding.
* **Anemia (low red blood cell count):** This can cause fatigue and weakness.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**
* **Diarrhea:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Hair thinning or loss (alopecia):**
* **Constipation:**
* **Liver function abnormalities:**
* **Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs):**  Rare but serious.
* **QT prolongation:** (A heart rhythm abnormality)


The severity of side effects can vary greatly between individuals. Some side effects are manageable with supportive care.  It's crucial to report any unusual or worsening symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:** Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.  Cancer cells need CDK4 and 6 to grow and divide. By blocking these enzymes, palbociclib slows or stops the growth of cancer cells, particularly those that are driven by hormones (hormone receptor-positive).  It works synergistically with hormonal therapies to further inhibit cancer cell proliferation.
