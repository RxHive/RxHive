# Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (13-Valent)
### Generic Name
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (13-Valent)

### Usage
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (13-valent), often shortened to PCV13, is primarily used to prevent pneumococcal disease caused by 13 strains of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* bacteria.  These bacteria can cause a range of serious infections, including pneumonia (lung infection), bacteremia (blood infection), meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), and otitis media (middle ear infection). PCV13 is particularly important for protecting individuals at higher risk of severe pneumococcal disease.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

The dosage for adults depends on age, underlying health conditions, and prior pneumococcal vaccination history.  A single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection is typically given.  The specific recommendations for adults are complex and vary depending on whether they have received previous pneumococcal vaccines (PCV13 or PPSV23).  Consult the prescribing information or a healthcare professional for detailed guidance based on individual vaccination history and risk factors.  Specific scenarios include:

* **Adults aged 19 to <65 years:**  A single dose of PCV13 is usually recommended, often followed by a dose of PPSV23 (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) after an interval of at least 8 weeks.  The exact schedule depends on prior vaccination history.
* **Adults â‰¥65 years (especially those who are immunocompromised, have a cochlear implant, or have a cerebrospinal fluid leak):** One dose of PCV13 may be recommended, often followed by PPSV23 at least 1 year later (8 weeks in certain high risk groups).  The schedule is again influenced by prior vaccinations.
* **Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients (off-label use):** Three 0.5 mL doses are given intramuscularly, with the first dose administered 3-6 months post-HSCT, and subsequent doses at least one month apart.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children also depends on age and health status. The typical dose is 0.5 mL given intramuscularly.

* **Primary Immunization (6 weeks to 15 months):** Four doses are given, typically at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. The minimum interval between doses is 4 weeks for infants under 1 year and 8 weeks between the third and fourth doses. Preterm infants should follow the chronological age schedule.
* **Catch-up Immunization (4 months to 6 years):** The number of doses required depends on the child's age and prior vaccination history.  Consult the current immunization guidelines for a precise schedule.
* **High-Risk Children (2-18 years):** The dosage and schedule for high-risk children vary considerably depending on prior vaccination history.  Guidance from a healthcare professional is crucial.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended based on hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.

**Administration:** The vaccine is given intramuscularly.  The injection site is the mid-lateral aspect of the thigh in infants and young children, and the deltoid muscle in older children and adults.

**Note:**  If any concerning side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

PCV13 works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the 13 specific serotypes of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. These antibodies help protect against infection by these bacteria.  The vaccine uses a conjugate of the bacterial polysaccharide and a protein (CRM197) to create a stronger and longer-lasting immune response than a polysaccharide vaccine alone.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to previous doses of pneumococcal vaccine, any component of the vaccine, or diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines.
* **Increased Risk:**  Individuals may have an increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, syncope (fainting), and shoulder injury related to vaccine administration.
* **Cautions:**  Use caution in patients with acute illness, bleeding disorders, or those receiving anticoagulant therapy.  Careful monitoring is necessary during and after administration.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Inactivated vaccines like PCV13 are generally considered safe during pregnancy.  While excretion in breast milk is unknown, the vaccine is not expected to harm breastfeeding infants.
* **Interactions:** Although rare, interactions with other medications should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection from PCV13 last?**  A: The duration of protection varies; additional booster doses may be recommended depending on age and risk factors.
* **Q: Can I get PCV13 if I'm sick?** A: It's generally recommended to postpone vaccination until you recover from an acute illness.
* **Q: What should I do if I faint after receiving the vaccine?** A: Lie down and elevate your legs.  Seek medical attention if symptoms persist.
* **Q: Is PCV13 safe for children?** A: PCV13 is generally safe and effective for children, but potential side effects should be monitored.
* **Q: How is PCV13 stored?** A:  Follow the storage guidelines provided by the manufacturer; typically, refrigeration is required.  Never freeze.
