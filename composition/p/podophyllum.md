# Podophyllum
### Generic Name
Podophyllum (Podophyllin)

### Usage
Podophyllum, also known as podophyllin, is a cytotoxic agent primarily used for the topical treatment of soft genital warts (condylomata acuminata).  These are warts that appear on the external genitalia and are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).  It's important to note that Podophyllum is a topical application only and is not suitable for internal use or for treating other types of warts.  Its use is strictly limited to the treatment of external genital warts.

### Dosage
**Soft external genital warts (condylomata acuminata):**

* **Topical, 25% solution:**  The affected area must be thoroughly cleansed before application. A small amount of the solution is applied directly to each wart using the provided applicator. The first application should be left on for only a few minutes (30-40 minutes) as a sensitivity test. Subsequent applications can be left on for 1-4 hours, depending on the wart's size and the patient's response.  Healthy skin surrounding the warts should be protected with petroleum jelly.  After the treatment time, the dried Podophyllum must be thoroughly removed with alcohol or soap and water.

* **Adult and Pediatric Dosage:** The dosage instructions are the same for adults and children. However, the use in children should only be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

* **Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects
* **Common:**  Burning or stinging sensation at the application site. Local skin irritation is also possible.

* **Serious (less common but require immediate medical attention):**  Systemic absorption of Podophyllum can lead to serious side effects, such as:
    * Coma
    * Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
    * Polyneuropathy (nerve damage)
    * Paralytic ileus (bowel obstruction)
    * Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
    * Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
    * Fever


If you experience any of these side effects, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Podophyllum works by directly interfering with the metabolism of epithelial cells (the cells that make up the outer layer of skin). It achieves this by arresting mitosis (cell division), which is crucial for wart growth. This action is mediated by Podophyllum's binding to a protein subunit of spindle microtubules (tubulin), essential components of the cellular machinery responsible for cell division.  By disrupting this process, Podophyllum effectively stops the growth and proliferation of the wart cells.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Podophyllum is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Podophyllum or its related components, bleeding warts, warts with hair growth, birthmarks, moles, diabetes, poor circulation, and those concurrently using steroids.  It is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:** Currently, no significant drug interactions are reported in the manufacturer's labeling. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Podophyllum is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes, as this can cause severe corneal damage.  The application should only be performed by healthcare professionals.  Large areas should not be treated at once, and inflamed or irritated skin should not be treated.  Overuse should be avoided.


### FAQs

    * **A:** The response time varies, but improvements may be observed within a few weeks with consistent application under medical supervision.  Multiple treatments are often necessary.
