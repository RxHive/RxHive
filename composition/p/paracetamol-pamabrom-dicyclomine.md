# Paracetamol + Pamabrom + Dicyclomine

**Generic Name:** Paracetamol + Pamabrom + Dicyclomine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps).  Paracetamol addresses pain and fever, pamabrom acts as a mild diuretic to reduce bloating and water retention, and dicyclomine helps relax the uterine muscles, reducing cramping.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage, but common ones include:

* **Paracetamol:**  Rarely causes side effects at recommended doses.  Overdose can cause serious liver damage.
* **Pamabrom:** Dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, headache, and allergic reactions (rash, itching).
* **Dicyclomine:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, drowsiness, urinary retention, and tachycardia (rapid heart rate).  More serious, though rare, side effects can include glaucoma worsening and increased risk of heart problems.

It's crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** Reduces fever by affecting areas of the brain that regulate temperature. It also reduces pain, although the exact mechanism is not fully understood.
* **Pamabrom:**  A mild diuretic (water pill), it helps reduce fluid retention which can contribute to bloating and breast tenderness associated with PMS. It also has some mild analgesic (pain-relieving) properties.
* **Dicyclomine:** A smooth muscle relaxant, it reduces the intensity of uterine contractions, thus lessening menstrual cramps.
