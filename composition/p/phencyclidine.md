# Phencyclidine
### Generic Name
Phencyclidine

### Usage
Phencyclidine (PCP) is a dissociative anesthetic.  While it was briefly used as an anesthetic in the past, its use was discontinued due to significant side effects.  Currently, it has *no* legitimate medical uses and is primarily known as a drug of abuse. Its effects include profound alterations in perception, mood, and cognition, leading to hallucinations, disorientation, and unpredictable behavior.

### Dosage
There is no safe or recommended dosage for phencyclidine as it is not approved for medical use.  Any use carries significant risks and potential for severe adverse effects.  The drug's effects are highly variable and depend on several factors including the dose, route of administration, individual sensitivity, and the presence of other substances.

### Side Effects
Phencyclidine use can cause a wide range of side effects, including:

* **Common:**  Hallucinations, disorientation, confusion, agitation, anxiety, paranoia, numbness, feelings of detachment from reality (dissociation), impaired judgment, slurred speech, muscle rigidity, incoordination, nystagmus (rapid involuntary eye movements).
* **Serious (but less common):**  Seizures, coma, respiratory depression, hyperthermia (high body temperature), cardiovascular problems (including dangerously high blood pressure or irregular heartbeat), severe behavioral disturbances, psychosis (potentially long-lasting), death.

**It is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if any adverse effects occur after exposure to phencyclidine.**

### How it Works
Phencyclidine acts primarily as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.  NMDA receptors are crucial for various brain functions, including learning, memory, and pain perception. By blocking these receptors, PCP disrupts normal brain activity, leading to the characteristic dissociative effects, including hallucinations, perceptual distortions, and altered sense of self.

### Precautions
**Phencyclidine is extremely dangerous and should never be used.**  There are no circumstances under which its use is medically advisable.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and older adults are particularly vulnerable to the severe and potentially life-threatening effects of PCP.  Interactions with other drugs, especially alcohol and other depressants, can significantly increase the risk of serious adverse events.
