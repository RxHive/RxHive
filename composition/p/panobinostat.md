# Panobinostat
### Generic Name
Panobinostat

### Usage
Panobinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI).  Its primary use is in the treatment of multiple myeloma.  Specifically, it's used in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for patients who have already received at least two prior treatment regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent.  It is not used as a single agent for multiple myeloma due to limited efficacy in that context.  Currently, there are no other approved uses for Panobinostat.

### Dosage

**Multiple Myeloma (Adults):** Panobinostat is administered orally. The standard dosage is 20 mg once every other day for three doses per week during weeks 1 and 2 of a 21-day treatment cycle. This equates to taking the medication on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of weeks 1 and 2, with a rest week 3.  A typical treatment course is up to 8 cycles, potentially extended to 16 cycles (48 weeks) if the patient shows clinical benefit and tolerates the treatment well.  This is always in conjunction with bortezomib and dexamethasone, with the schedules for those medications adjusted accordingly.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The starting dose needs to be reduced for patients with hepatic impairment.  Mild impairment: 15 mg; Moderate impairment: 10 mg; Severe impairment: Panobinostat should be avoided.  Close monitoring is crucial to adjust the dosage based on individual tolerance and adverse events.

* **Renal Impairment:**  While manufacturer labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (excluding those on dialysis), pharmacokinetic studies suggest no significant impact on Panobinostat exposure.  However, close monitoring is necessary.  For end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with or without dialysis, dosage adjustments are not specified, and the dialyzability of Panobinostat is unknown.

* **Toxicity Management:** Dosage adjustments or treatment interruptions are necessary based on the severity of hematologic (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia), cardiovascular (QT prolongation), gastrointestinal (diarrhea), or other toxicities.  Specific guidelines for dose modifications are outlined in the prescribing information and should be followed meticulously by healthcare professionals.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Panobinostat in pediatric patients have not been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue, lethargy, malaise
* Diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting
* Abnormal ECG findings (T-wave abnormalities, ST-segment depression)

* Increased serum creatinine


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less, but potentially life-threatening):**

* QT prolongation
* Hemorrhage
* Severe infections (sepsis)
* Hepatic dysfunction (hepatitis B, increased liver enzymes)
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure

### How it Works

Panobinostat is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.  HDACs are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histone proteins.  By inhibiting HDACs, Panobinostat increases the acetylation of histones, altering gene expression.  This leads to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (programmed cell death) in some cancer cells, specifically impacting multiple myeloma cells when used in combination therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone.  The combined effect of these three drugs is synergistic, meaning their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  There are no specific contraindications explicitly listed in the manufacturer's labeling, but caution is advised.
* **Drug Interactions:** Panobinostat's metabolism can be affected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (increased blood levels) and inducers (decreased blood levels).  Concomitant use with other QT-prolonging drugs or CYP2D6 substrates should be avoided.
* **Warnings:**  Panobinostat carries risks of bone marrow suppression, cardiac events, gastrointestinal toxicity, hemorrhage, hepatic dysfunction, and infections.  It's crucial to closely monitor patients for these adverse effects.  Panobinostat is also embryotoxic and teratogenic (can harm a developing fetus); women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment.  Males should use condoms during treatment and for at least six months after the final dose.
* **Pregnant/Breastfeeding Women:** Panobinostat can cause fetal harm; women should avoid pregnancy during treatment and for at least three months after the final dose. The excretion of Panobinostat in breast milk is unknown; a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or the medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Panobinostat with food?** A: Yes, Panobinostat can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, up to 12 hours after the scheduled time. Do not take a double dose.

* **Q: How should I store Panobinostat?** A: Store Panobinostat capsules at room temperature in a dry place, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Are there any foods or drinks I should avoid while taking Panobinostat?** A: Avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, star fruit, pomegranate, and pomegranate juice as they can affect the metabolism of Panobinostat.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, especially severe ones.

* **Q: Is Panobinostat suitable for children?** A: No, the safety and efficacy of Panobinostat have not been established in children.
