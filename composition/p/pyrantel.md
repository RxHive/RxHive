# Pyrantel
### Generic Name
Pyrantel

### Usage
Pyrantel is primarily used to treat enterobiasis (pinworm infection).  It's a highly effective anthelmintic, meaning it's designed to kill parasitic worms.  While its main use is against pinworms, pyrantel also has off-label uses in treating other parasitic worm infections, including ascariasis (roundworm infection), hookworm infections, and trichostrongyliasis.  The off-label uses are often considered when other treatment options are ineffective or unavailable.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate usage based on the specific parasitic infection.


### Dosage

**Dosage is expressed as Pyrantel base.**  Always follow the directions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Self-treating parasitic infections can be risky.

**Adults:**

* **Enterobiasis (Pinworm):**  11 mg/kg as a single dose, not exceeding 1 gram.  A repeat dose in two weeks is often recommended to prevent reinfection.
* **Ascariasis (Roundworm), Hookworm, Trichostrongyliasis (Off-label):**  Dosage varies depending on the infection.  Consult a doctor for specific instructions.  Generally, a single dose of 11 mg/kg (not exceeding 1 gram) or a 3-day course might be prescribed.

**Children (over 2 years old):**

Dosage is determined based on weight, often following a weight-based calculation (11 mg/kg) or a fixed dose regimen depending on the child's weight and the specific infection being treated. For pinworm, fixed-dose regimens are often used, for instance, 125mg for children weighing 11-16kg, 250mg for 17-28kg, etc.  Always follow a doctor's prescription precisely. Treatment of the entire household is often recommended for pinworm to prevent reinfection.  For other parasitic infections, dosage and course of treatment may differ and will always be dictated by a doctor. Note: Safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 2 years old.

**Dosage Forms:** Pyrantel is available in tablet and suspension (liquid) forms. Follow the instructions on the label for how to take the medication, ensuring the suspension is properly shaken before use.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Pyrantel works by paralyzing parasitic worms. It achieves this by increasing the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and by inhibiting cholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.  The resulting excess acetylcholine causes paralysis in the worms, leading to their expulsion from the body.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pyrantel is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to pyrantel pamoate or any of its components and in those with intestinal obstruction.
* **Interactions:** Pyrantel has an antagonistic interaction with piperazine. These medications should not be used concurrently.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in individuals with liver problems.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary; consult your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of pyrantel during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your healthcare provider before using it during these periods.
* **Children:**  Always follow a doctor's guidance for children, ensuring the appropriate dosage and monitoring for side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take pyrantel with food?** A: The tablets can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effects usually manifest quickly, with worms being expelled within a few days.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor for instructions.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store pyrantel?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
