# Prulifloxacin
### Generic Name
Prulifloxacin

### Usage

Prulifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class.  It's primarily used to treat bacterial infections, specifically:

* **Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis:** This refers to a worsening of symptoms in individuals with long-term bronchitis. Prulifloxacin helps combat the bacterial infection contributing to the flare-up.
* **Uncomplicated Lower Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):**  This targets simpler UTIs, like cystitis (bladder infection), that haven't spread to the kidneys.
* **Complicated Lower Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** This encompasses more severe UTIs, often involving factors like kidney involvement or other underlying health issues.

It's crucial to understand that Prulifloxacin is effective only against bacterial infections. It will not work against viral or fungal infections.  A doctor's diagnosis is necessary to ensure appropriate use.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The standard oral dose is 600mg once daily. The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection:

* **Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis:**  A maximum of 10 days.
* **Uncomplicated lower UTIs:**  The duration isn't specified in the provided information, but it's usually shorter than for complicated infections.
* **Complicated lower UTIs:** A maximum of 10 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Prulifloxacin in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver problems. Use with caution and under close medical supervision is recommended.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer specific dosage adjustments for kidney problems. However, empirical adjustments (reducing the dose by 25-50% in moderate kidney insufficiency) may be considered by the physician.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain)
* Gastritis (stomach inflammation)
* Diarrhea
* Fever
* Altered taste
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Sleep disorders
* Eye redness
* Itching
* Skin rash
* Facial eczema
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Muscle spasms
* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but serious skin reaction)

Less common but serious side effects are possible.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reaction, significant changes in muscle function, or any other concerning symptoms.**


### How it Works

Prulifloxacin is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, ulifloxacin, in the body. Ulifloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for bacterial DNA replication. By blocking this enzyme, ulifloxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately helps to eliminate the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Prulifloxacin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to Prulifloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or related components; children under 18 with uncomplicated skeletal development; patients with a history of quinolone-related tendon diseases; and patients with celiac disease.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are at increased risk of hemolytic reactions.  Photosensitivity, Achilles tendon damage (especially in the elderly, those on corticosteroids, or organ transplant recipients), crystalluria (crystals in the urine), rhabdomyolysis, and superinfections (new infections due to overgrowth of other microbes) are also potential risks.
* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution when using Prulifloxacin in patients prone to seizures, those with electrolyte imbalances (low potassium or calcium), heart rhythm disorders, kidney or liver problems, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or central nervous system disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with cimetidine, antacids (containing aluminum or magnesium), iron or calcium preparations, probenecid, theophylline, oral anticoagulants (like warfarin), and NSAIDs is not recommended due to potential interactions that can alter drug effectiveness or increase side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Prulifloxacin with food?** A: Prulifloxacin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store Prulifloxacin?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Is Prulifloxacin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  It's categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking. Breastfeeding should be avoided while taking Prulifloxacin.  Always consult your doctor about medication use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Prulifloxacin when I feel better?** A: No, complete the entire prescribed course of treatment, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection and development of antibiotic resistance.
