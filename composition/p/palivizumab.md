# Palivizumab
### Generic Name
Palivizumab

### Usage
Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody used primarily to prevent serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants and young children.  It's crucial to understand that Palivizumab is a preventative measure, not a treatment for RSV infection.  It doesn't cure RSV or treat existing symptoms.  The medication is specifically targeted at preventing severe RSV disease which can lead to hospitalization or other serious complications.

### Dosage
Palivizumab is administered intramuscularly (IM) and is **not** indicated for adults.  Dosage for infants and children under 24 months old at high risk of RSV infection is 15 mg/kg once monthly throughout the RSV season. The first dose is given before the RSV season begins.  The maximum recommended dose is 5 doses per season.  If a child is hospitalized at the start of RSV season, Palivizumab should ideally be given 48-72 hours before discharge or soon after.  If a breakthrough RSV infection requiring hospitalization occurs, monthly prophylaxis should be stopped for the rest of that season.

Specific high-risk groups include:

* Infants born at ≤35 weeks gestational age and ≤6 months old at the start of RSV season.
* Infants and children ≤24 months old with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) requiring medical treatment within the previous 6 months.
* Infants and children ≤24 months old with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD).

The exact criteria for high-risk infants may vary slightly depending on the guidelines of the healthcare provider and local recommendations.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions.  The injection should be given undiluted in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh; avoid the gluteal muscle due to the risk of sciatic nerve damage.  Volumes over 1 mL should be divided into multiple injections. Do not shake or vigorously agitate the vial before administration.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10%):

* Skin rash
* Fever

Less common side effects (1-10%):

* Antibody development

Rare but serious side effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):

* Anaphylaxis (including angioedema, dyspnea, hypotonia, pruritus, respiratory failure, unresponsiveness, and urticaria)
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Injection-site reaction
* Thrombocytopenia

If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the F protein on the surface of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).  By binding to this protein, Palivizumab prevents RSV from fusing with and entering human cells.  This neutralizing activity blocks RSV replication and thus reduces the severity of infection.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Palivizumab is contraindicated in patients with a significant prior hypersensitivity reaction to Palivizumab or any component of the formulation.
* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions.  Emergency treatment should be readily available during and after administration.  Use with caution in patients with a history of bleeding disorders.
* **Interactions:**  Palivizumab may interact with other monoclonal antibodies; for example, it might enhance adverse effects of belimumab.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you're taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Palivizumab is not indicated for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does Palivizumab protection last?** A:  Protection lasts for approximately one month per dose. The duration of the RSV season determines the total number of doses needed.

* **Q:  Can I use Palivizumab to treat an RSV infection?** A: No, Palivizumab is for prevention only, not treatment.  If your child develops RSV symptoms, contact a healthcare professional immediately.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to discuss rescheduling the dose.  Do not try to double up on doses.

* **Q: How is Palivizumab stored?** A:  Store Palivizumab as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Typically, it requires refrigeration.

* **Q: Is Palivizumab safe for premature infants?** A:  Palivizumab is used in high-risk premature infants, but careful monitoring is crucial as they are a more vulnerable population.

* **Q: Can I give my child Palivizumab at home?** A: Palivizumab must be administered by a healthcare professional.  It's crucial to follow the injection technique precisely to avoid complications.
