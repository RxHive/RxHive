# Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Caffeine

**Generic Name:** Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Caffeine

**Usage:** This combination medication is a decongestant, antihistamine, and stimulant used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, hay fever, and other upper respiratory allergies.  Phenylephrine reduces nasal congestion by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that reduces sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes. Caffeine is a stimulant that helps to increase alertness and reduce fatigue associated with these conditions.  It's typically used for short-term relief of symptoms.

**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* **From Phenylephrine:** Increased blood pressure, nervousness, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea.  Rarely, more serious cardiovascular effects can occur.
* **From Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, blurred vision, difficulty urinating.
* **From Caffeine:** Restlessness, insomnia, nervousness, increased heart rate, headache, upset stomach.

More serious side effects are rare but possible and require immediate medical attention. These could include:

* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Irregular heartbeat
* High blood pressure
* Seizures


**How it Works:**

* **Phenylephrine:** This decongestant acts by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the nasal passages. This causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This antihistamine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms associated with allergies, such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
* **Caffeine:** Acts as a central nervous system stimulant, increasing alertness and potentially counteracting the drowsiness that can be caused by the antihistamine.
