# Pretomanid
### Generic Name
Pretomanid

### Usage
Pretomanid is an antitubercular medication.  Importantly, it's *not* used alone. It's only indicated as part of a combination therapy with bedaquiline and linezolid. This triple-drug combination is specifically for treating adults with pulmonary tuberculosis that's extensively drug-resistant (XDR) or is multidrug-resistant (MDR) and either treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive to standard treatments.  It's crucial to understand that Pretomanid is *not* appropriate for drug-sensitive tuberculosis, latent TB infection, or MDR-TB that responds to standard treatment.

### Dosage
Pretomanid is administered orally, always in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid.  The recommended dosage for adults with XDR-TB or treatment-intolerant/nonresponsive MDR-TB is:

* **Pretomanid:** 200 mg (one tablet) once daily for 26 weeks.
* **Bedaquiline:** 400 mg once daily for the first two weeks, then 200 mg three times per week (with at least 48 hours between doses) for the remaining 24 weeks (total 26 weeks).
* **Linezolid:**  Starts at 1200 mg per day for 26 weeks.  The dose may be adjusted down to 600 mg daily or 300 mg daily, or treatment may be interrupted, depending on the occurrence of side effects like myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, or optic neuropathy.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Pretomanid in children have not been established.  Therefore, it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The effects of hepatic or renal impairment on Pretomanid's safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics are currently unknown.  Specific dosage adjustments for these conditions haven't been determined.


### Side Effects
Pretomanid's side effects can vary in frequency and severity.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any adverse reactions.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Peripheral neuropathy (including severe cases), headache.
* Respiratory: Pleuritic chest pain, lower respiratory tract infection, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), cough.
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia (indigestion), decreased appetite, abdominal pain, increased serum amylase levels.
* Ophthalmic: Visual impairment.
* Dermatologic: Acne, skin rash, itching (pruritus).
* Endocrine and metabolic: Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).
* Hepatic: Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST).
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Musculoskeletal pain.
* Hematologic: Anemia.


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or less, but potentially serious):**

* Nervous system: Insomnia, dizziness, seizures.
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension (high blood pressure), prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG).
* Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, constipation, gastritis, increased serum lipase, altered taste (dysgeusia), pancreatitis.
* Ophthalmic: Optic neuropathy.
* Dermatologic: Dry skin (xeroderma).
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Increased creatine phosphokinase levels.
* Endocrine and metabolic: Weight loss, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), hyperkalemia (high potassium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hyponatremia (low sodium).
* Hematologic: Neutropenia (low neutrophils), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), decreased absolute neutrophil count, leukopenia (low white blood cells).
* Hepatic: Increased levels of AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
* Renal: Increased serum creatinine levels.
* Hematologic: Pancytopenia (deficiency of all blood cell types).
* Endocrine and metabolic: Lactic acidosis (buildup of lactic acid).
* Hepatic: Hepatotoxicity (liver damage).


### How it Works
Pretomanid is a nitroimidazooxazine antimycobacterial drug. It works by targeting *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the bacteria that cause tuberculosis.  Pretomanid kills actively growing TB bacteria by interfering with the production of mycolic acid, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall.  Under low-oxygen (anaerobic) conditions, it also acts as a respiratory poison against bacteria that aren't actively reproducing, achieved by releasing nitric oxide.  These actions require the reduction of Pretomanid within the bacterial cell by a specific enzyme, relying on a co-factor.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Pretomanid is contraindicated in patients for whom bedaquiline or linezolid are contraindicated, as it's always used in combination with these drugs.
* **Increased Risk:**  Pretomanid increases the risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage), myelosuppression (suppression of bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts), peripheral and optic neuropathy (nerve damage), lactic acidosis, and QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality).  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pretomanid can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specific interactions include potential increases in levels of certain drugs (OAT1/3 substrates) and decreases or increases in Pretomanid levels due to interactions with CYP3A4 inducers or alcohol, respectively.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Pretomanid during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* **Vulnerable Groups:**  Pretomanid's safety and efficacy haven't been established in children or individuals with severe liver or kidney disease.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Pretomanid alone?** A: No. Pretomanid is always administered as part of a combination regimen with bedaquiline and linezolid.
* **Q: How should I store Pretomanid?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label.  Generally, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.  Missed doses may need to be made up, but this varies depending on which medication was missed and the reason for the missed dose.
* **Q: Is Pretomanid safe for everyone?** A: No. It carries potential risks and side effects, particularly in certain patient groups.  Your doctor will assess if it's appropriate for you based on your health status and other factors.
* **Q: How effective is Pretomanid?** A:  Pretomanid's effectiveness is demonstrated when used as part of a specific triple-drug regimen for treating extensively drug-resistant or treatment-intolerant/nonresponsive multidrug-resistant TB.  Success is measured by bacteriologic success (negative TB culture) without relapse.
