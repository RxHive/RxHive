# Prasterone
### Generic Name
Prasterone

### Usage
Prasterone is a medication used to treat moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) in postmenopausal women.  This pain is often a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (thinning and dryness of the vaginal walls and vulva), a common consequence of menopause.  Prasterone's primary use is to alleviate this discomfort and improve sexual function in this specific population.  It is not indicated for other uses.

### Dosage
**Adults (Postmenopausal Women):** The typical dosage is 6.5 mg administered intravaginally once daily at bedtime.  The medication is applied using a single-use applicator provided with the prescription.

**Children:** Prasterone's safety and effectiveness in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects
Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):

* Vaginal discharge

Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

* Abnormal Pap smear


Serious side effects are less common but should be reported to your doctor immediately.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should prompt a consultation with your healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Prasterone is a steroid hormone that is considered inactive in its administered form. Once inside the body, it is converted into active androgens and/or estrogens.  The precise mechanism by which it alleviates dyspareunia related to vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women is not fully understood.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to prasterone or related components.
* Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in women with a history of known or suspected breast cancer.
* Increased risk of vaginal discharge.  
* Before starting treatment, the cause of any persistent or recurring genital bleeding should be evaluated and determined in postmenopausal women.

**Drug Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions are currently reported in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to ensure there are no potential interactions.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Prasterone is only indicated for postmenopausal women and therefore not relevant during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Excretion of prasterone in breast milk is unknown.
