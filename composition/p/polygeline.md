# Polygeline
### Generic Name
Polygeline

### Usage
Polygeline is a plasma volume expander used primarily in the initial treatment of hypovolemic shock. This type of shock arises from significant blood or fluid loss due to various causes such as hemorrhage (both visible and internal bleeding), burns, peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), and crush injuries.  It's also used for fluid replacement during plasma exchange procedures, in extracorporeal circulation (like during heart surgery), for isolated organ perfusion, and as a carrier solution for insulin.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the severity of the condition and the patient's response.

* **Hypovolemic Shock (IV Infusion):** The usual starting dose is 500-1000 mL, with a maximum daily dose not exceeding 2500 mL (or approximately 20 mL/kg/day).  For blood loss exceeding 1500 mL, blood transfusion will likely be necessary in addition to Polygeline and crystalloid solutions. The exact dosage and infusion rate are determined by the amount of blood loss and the patient's hemodynamic status (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.).  Up to 1500 mL of blood loss can potentially be replaced solely with Polygeline; for larger volumes, Polygeline and blood transfusions are administered concurrently.

* **Burns (IV Infusion):** The initial dose is calculated based on the percentage of body surface area affected by burns.  A general guideline is 1 mL/kg of body weight multiplied by the percentage of body surface area burned, administered over 24 hours for two days. Additional crystalloid solutions are typically given to address normal fluid loss.

* **Plasma Exchange (IV Infusion):**  Up to 2 liters may be used as the sole replacement fluid.  Generally, the volume administered depends on the amount of plasma removed, and Polygeline may be combined with other fluids.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Hypovolemic Shock (IV Infusion):**  The usual dose is 5-10 mL/kg. The total dose and infusion rate are determined by the extent of blood loss and the child's hemodynamic parameters.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with liver impairment, as Polygeline is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. However, use caution in patients with impaired renal function.

### Side Effects

* Transient urticarial skin reactions (hives)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Nausea and/or vomiting
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Fever and/or shivering
* Dizziness upon standing
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels)

Less frequent but more serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual reactions.

### How it Works

Polygeline is a colloid solution, meaning it contains large molecules that remain in the bloodstream for a longer time than crystalloid solutions (like saline).  It's composed of polymerized polypeptides derived from gelatin.  Its osmotic pressure and viscosity are similar to plasma, allowing it to expand blood volume and improve blood pressure.  This helps to restore adequate circulation in cases of hypovolemic shock.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Polygeline should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Polygeline or its components, pre-existing anaphylactoid reactions, asthma, predisposition to histamine release, hemostatic defects (bleeding disorders), cardiac failure, hypercalcemia, or those currently undergoing digitalis treatment.

**Warnings:** Increased risk of skin reactions, histamine release effects, hypercalcemia, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), and gastrointestinal effects (nausea and vomiting) are possible. Use with caution in patients with impaired renal function, those at risk for pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) or congestive heart failure, those with increased risk of histamine release, and those receiving cardiac glycosides. Citrated blood should not be mixed with Polygeline or administered through the same intravenous line due to the potential for calcium-induced clotting.  

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Polygeline may be used during pregnancy if blood is unavailable and plasma volume replacement is necessary.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs

**Q: How is Polygeline administered?**
A:  Polygeline is administered intravenously (IV) by infusion only.

**Q: How long does it take for Polygeline to work?**
A: The effects of Polygeline are typically seen relatively quickly, helping to restore blood volume and blood pressure.

**Q: How is Polygeline stored?**
A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature and away from direct sunlight.  Check the product labeling for specific storage recommendations.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Stop using the medication and contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

**Q: Can Polygeline be mixed with other medications?**
A: Some compatible water-soluble drugs can be infused with Polygeline, but this should be done under medical supervision. Consult with a healthcare professional before mixing Polygeline with other medications.  Note that mixing with citrated blood is contraindicated.
