# Piribedil
### Generic Name
Piribedil

### Usage
Piribedil is primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease.  It's used either as a standalone treatment (monotherapy) or in conjunction with levodopa, another common Parkinson's medication.  Piribedil works by acting as a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of dopamine in the brain.  This is significant because Parkinson's disease is characterized by a deficiency of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control.  By stimulating dopamine receptors, piribedil helps alleviate the motor symptoms associated with the disease.

### Dosage
Dosage of piribedil varies greatly depending on the individual and whether it's used alone or with levodopa.  It's always crucial to follow a doctor's prescribed regimen.

**Adult Dosage (Parkinson's Disease):**

* **Oral:** The medication is typically taken orally.
* **Initial Dose:** Usually starts at 50 mg per day for the first week.
* **Monotherapy Maintenance Dose:**  This gradually increases to 150-250 mg per day, divided into 3-5 doses.
* **With Levodopa:** The dosage is typically lower, ranging from 80-140 mg per day (approximately 20 mg of piribedil for every 100 mg of levodopa), divided into multiple doses.  The exact ratio will be determined by the healthcare professional.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** The dose is increased gradually, typically by 50mg every 3 days, under careful medical supervision.  Specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment aren't explicitly detailed in standard prescribing information, so close monitoring is necessary.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of piribedil in children have not been established, so it is not recommended for use in children.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Agitation, confusion, dizziness, hallucinations
* Gastrointestinal: Flatulence, nausea, vomiting

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Nervous system: Impulse control disorders (like pathological gambling), drowsiness
* Endocrine and metabolic: Increased libido
* Cardiovascular: Altered blood pressure, hypotension (low blood pressure), orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing), syncope (fainting)
* Other: Malaise (general discomfort), hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), narcolepsy (sudden sleep attacks)

**Important Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the less common or serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Piribedil is a dopamine agonist that primarily works by stimulating dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter vital for smooth muscle movement, and a lack of dopamine is central to the motor impairments seen in Parkinson's disease.  By acting on these receptors, piribedil helps to improve motor function. It also exhibits some adrenoceptor antagonist properties, although the clinical significance of this is less well-understood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Piribedil is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to piribedil or its components, cardiogenic shock, the acute phase of a myocardial infarction (heart attack), uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), or cardiovascular collapse.  It is also contraindicated during pregnancy and should not be co-administered with certain antiemetic (anti-nausea) or antipsychotic neuroleptics.
* **Interactions:**  The effects of piribedil may be counteracted by certain medications, such as clonidine and dopamine antagonists (including phenothiazines and haloperidol).  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you're taking.
* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with Raynaud's syndrome, a history of psychosis, or renal impairment.  Piribedil may increase the risk of hypotension, impulse control disorders, and somnolence (sleepiness).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Piribedil is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking piribedil?** A:  Piribedil can cause drowsiness and dizziness. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.
* **Q: How should I store piribedil?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking piribedil suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping piribedil may lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before changing or discontinuing your medication.
* **Q: Does piribedil cure Parkinson's disease?** A: No, piribedil does not cure Parkinson's disease but helps manage its symptoms.
