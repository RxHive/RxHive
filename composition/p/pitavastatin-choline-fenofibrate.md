# Pitavastatin + Choline fenofibrate
### Generic Name
Pitavastatin + Choline Fenofibrate

**Note:**  Pitavastatin and Choline Fenofibrate are typically prescribed as separate medications, not as a fixed-dose combination.  This information addresses each drug individually, as combining them requires specific medical guidance from a healthcare professional.  It is crucial to *never* combine medications without explicit instructions from your doctor.


### Pitavastatin Usage

Pitavastatin is primarily used to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often called "bad" cholesterol.  This helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in adults with high cholesterol who have not achieved their cholesterol goals with diet and exercise alone.  It may also be used as an adjunct to other cholesterol-lowering therapies.


### Choline Fenofibrate Usage

Choline Fenofibrate is used to lower levels of triglycerides and raise levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), often called "good" cholesterol.  It's prescribed to treat hyperlipidemia (high levels of fats in the blood), specifically those with high triglycerides and low HDL-C.  It may also be used to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in certain high-risk individuals.


### Dosage

**Pitavastatin:** Dosage is typically determined by a doctor and depends on individual needs and response to treatment.  It is usually taken once daily, with or without food.  Specific dosages will vary, ranging from 1mg to 4mg per day.  There is no specific pediatric formulation, and use in children is not generally recommended.  IV administration is not applicable to pitavastatin, which is an oral medication.

**Choline Fenofibrate:**  Dosage depends on the specific formulation and individual patient factors.  It's typically administered once daily with food.  Dosages usually range from 400mg to 600mg of fenofibrate, although the exact amount of choline in the formulation will vary.  Again, there's no typical pediatric formulation, and the use in children is not generally recommended.  IV administration is not applicable for choline fenofibrate.


### Side Effects

**Pitavastatin:** Common side effects include headache, muscle aches (myalgia), and upper respiratory tract infections.  Less common but more serious side effects include rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), liver damage, and allergic reactions.

**Choline Fenofibrate:** Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and elevated liver enzymes.  Less common but more serious side effects include gallstones, muscle pain (myalgia), and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).


### How it Works

**Pitavastatin:** It inhibits an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol production in the liver. By inhibiting this enzyme, pitavastatin reduces the production of LDL-C.

**Choline Fenofibrate:** It activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which are nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism.  Activation of PPARs leads to decreased triglyceride production and increased HDL-C levels.


### Precautions

**Pitavastatin:**  It should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease, kidney disease, and muscle disorders.  It's important to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, as interactions can occur.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your physician before starting pitavastatin.

**Choline Fenofibrate:**  It should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease, kidney disease, gallstones, and pancreatitis.  Similar to pitavastatin, interactions with other medications are possible, and this needs careful consideration.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your physician before starting choline fenofibrate.
