# Phendimetrazine
### Generic Name
Phendimetrazine

### Usage
Phendimetrazine is a medication classified as an anorexiant, meaning it suppresses appetite.  It's used as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a weight-loss program for individuals with significant obesity.  Specifically, it's indicated for those with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or higher, or a BMI of 27 kg/m² or higher if they have additional risk factors like controlled hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia.  Importantly, it's only used for patients who haven't seen success with diet and exercise alone.  The goal is to aid in weight loss by reducing appetite, but it's crucial to understand it's a short-term tool and not a standalone solution for obesity management.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Obesity, short-term adjunct):**

* **Oral, Extended-release:** 105 mg once daily (OD), taken 30-60 minutes before the morning meal.
* **Oral, Immediate-release:** 35 mg twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID), 1 hour before meals. In some cases, a lower dose of 17.5 mg per dose may be sufficient.  The maximum daily dose is 70 mg three times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage (Obesity, short-term adjunct):**

* This medication is only approved for adolescents aged 17 years and older.  The dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.

### How it Works
Phendimetrazine is a sympathomimetic amine, meaning it mimics the effects of certain neurotransmitters in the body. It works primarily by stimulating the release of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that regulates appetite.  This increased norepinephrine activity leads to a decreased feeling of hunger, thus suppressing appetite.

### Precautions

**Contraindications (Do not use if):**

* Allergy to phendimetrazine or other sympathomimetic amines.
* Glaucoma.
* Pregnancy.
* History of drug abuse.
* Advanced arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or other significant cardiovascular disease (varies based on formulation).
* Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
* Concurrent use of other anorectic agents or CNS stimulants.
* Use within 14 days of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
* Breastfeeding (for extended-release formulations).  


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, renal impairment, history of seizure disorders, Tourette syndrome, or elderly patients.
* There is an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease.  Cardiac evaluation may be needed.
* Abrupt discontinuation after prolonged high doses may cause fatigue and depression.
* Tolerance to the appetite-suppressing effects can develop.
* Not recommended for patients with known heart murmur or valvular heart disease.
*  This medication is not a long-term solution for weight management and should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive weight loss program.
