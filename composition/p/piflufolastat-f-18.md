# Piflufolastat F-18
### Generic Name
Piflufolastat F-18

### Usage
Piflufolastat F-18 is a radioactive diagnostic agent used in positron-emission tomography (PET) scans.  Its primary use is to detect prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions in men with prostate cancer. This is particularly helpful in men suspected of having metastatic disease (cancer spread to other parts of the body) who are considering initial definitive treatment, or in those with suspected recurrence based on elevated levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in their blood.  Essentially, it helps doctors visualize where the cancer might be located.


### Dosage
**Diagnostic imaging (adults):** The usual intravenous (IV) dose is 333 MBq (9 mCi), with a range of 296–370 MBq (8–10 mCi) administered as a single dose.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Piflufolastat F-18 in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)

**Less Common (<1%):**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Piflufolastat F-18 works by binding to PSMA, a protein found on the surface of many prostate cancer cells, especially those that are aggressive.  Because prostate cancer cells often overexpress PSMA,  the Piflufolastat F-18 concentrates in these cancerous areas. The fluorine-18 (F-18) component is a radioactive tracer that emits positrons, allowing it to be detected by a PET scanner. This creates images that help doctors pinpoint the location and extent of the cancer.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Piflufolastat F-18 is not indicated for use in females due to the potential for fetal harm from radiation. Breast milk excretion is unknown.
* **Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT):**  Androgen deprivation therapy and other treatments targeting the androgen pathway may alter Piflufolastat F-18 uptake in prostate cancer. The impact of these therapies on the scan's accuracy is not fully understood.
* **Radiation Safety:** Piflufolastat F-18 is a radiopharmaceutical.  Appropriate handling and disposal precautions are crucial. Healthcare professionals should follow safety measures to minimize radiation exposure during administration and disposal.
* **Imaging Interpretation:** There is an increased risk of errors in interpreting the images obtained with this scan.
* **Hypersensitivity:** There's a potential for hypersensitivity reactions to occur.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Piflufolastat F-18 administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as a bolus, possibly diluted with normal saline.

* **Q: What should I do before and after the scan?** A: Void before the scan.  Drink plenty of fluids before and after the scan and void frequently to reduce radiation exposure.

* **Q: How long does the scan take?** A: The scan begins 60 minutes after injection; starting later than 90 minutes may affect results.

* **Q: Are there any special precautions I need to take after the scan?** A: Follow your doctor's instructions regarding hydration and voiding frequency to minimize radiation exposure.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.
