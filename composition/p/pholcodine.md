# Pholcodine
### Generic Name
Pholcodine

### Usage
Pholcodine is a medication primarily used to relieve acute, non-productive coughs associated with upper respiratory tract infections.  A non-productive cough is one that doesn't produce phlegm or mucus.  It works by suppressing the cough reflex in the brain, providing temporary relief from the irritating cough.  It's important to note that pholcodine doesn't treat the underlying cause of the cough; it only manages the symptom.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Oral Linctus (liquid):**  Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation.  Always follow the instructions on your prescription label. Common doses range from 5-10ml, up to six times daily (but not exceeding the maximum daily dose specified on the label).  Elderly or weakened patients might require a lower dose.

* **Other formulations:**  Other forms of pholcodine may exist but are less common.  Always consult the prescribing information for accurate dosing instructions for any non-linctus formulation.

**Children:**

* **Pholcodine is generally contraindicated (not recommended) in children under 6 years old (for standard linctus formulations) and under 12 years old (for specific formulations).**  Never administer pholcodine to a child without explicit instructions from a doctor.  Dosing for older children (6-12 years or older, depending on the specific formulation) will be significantly lower than adult doses and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Liver disease:** Pholcodine is metabolized in the liver.  Its use is contraindicated in patients with liver disease, and it must be used with extreme caution in those with liver impairment.
* **Kidney disease:** Use with caution in patients with kidney disease.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Sputum retention (accumulation of mucus in the lungs), skin reactions (rash, etc.), hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).  Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), a serious skin reaction, has also been linked to pholcodine use.

**If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.**

### How it Works

Pholcodine suppresses the cough reflex by acting directly on the brain, specifically in the medulla or pons regions. This action reduces the signals that trigger coughing.  It has minimal to no pain-relieving (analgesic) or euphoric effects compared to other opioid medications.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Pholcodine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components; those with respiratory problems like asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or bronchiectasis; patients at risk of respiratory failure; and those taking or who have recently stopped taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  It is also contraindicated in children under a certain age (as specified above, depending on formulation). It should not be used in those with known liver disease.

* **Drug Interactions:** Pholcodine can interact with various medications, including:
    * **Antihypertensives and diuretics:** May increase the blood pressure-lowering effect of these medications.
    * **CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, hypnotics, narcotic analgesics, sedatives, tranquilizers):**  Can enhance the sedative effects of pholcodine, potentially leading to dangerous respiratory depression.  Concurrent use with sedatives like benzodiazepines requires careful monitoring and should only be considered when other options aren't viable.
    * **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs):**  May cause a hypertensive crisis. Avoid concurrent use.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The risks and benefits of using pholcodine during pregnancy or breastfeeding must be carefully weighed.  It's crucial to consult with a doctor.  Pholcodine can pass into breast milk, though usually in small amounts.

* **Elderly and Children:**  Use with caution in elderly individuals and children (as discussed in the dosage section).  They may be more susceptible to side effects.

* **Patients with Liver or Kidney Impairment:** Use with caution.
