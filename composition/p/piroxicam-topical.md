# Piroxicam (Topical)
### Generic Name
Piroxicam (Topical)

### Usage

Piroxicam topical is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain, inflammation, and stiffness in joints.  It's particularly helpful for conditions where topical application is suitable, such as osteoarthritis affecting the joints, acute musculoskeletal injuries (like sprains or strains), periarthritis (inflammation of tissues surrounding a joint), epicondylitis ("tennis elbow" or "golfer's elbow"), tendinitis (inflammation of a tendon), and tenosynovitis (inflammation of the tendon sheath).  The topical route of administration minimizes systemic absorption compared to oral forms, thus reducing the risk of certain side effects associated with oral NSAIDs.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Gel:**  Apply 1 gram (approximately a 3 cm strip) to the affected area 3-4 times daily.
* **Patch:** Apply one patch to the affected area every two days.  The patch may be replaced daily if it becomes wet (e.g., from bathing or excessive sweating).

**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of topical piroxicam in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these situations.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Contact dermatitis
* Dermatitis
* Skin rash
* Local irritation
* Local itching (pruritus)
* Localized erythema (redness)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Exfoliation of the skin (severe peeling)
* Eczema
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea
* Photophobia (light sensitivity)
*  Rare instances of more severe reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which are serious skin conditions requiring immediate medical attention.  
* Renal effects (interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure), although rare with topical application.

**Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and contact a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Piroxicam works by reversibly inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, piroxicam helps to alleviate pain and inflammation at the site of application.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Piroxicam topical is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to piroxicam or any component of the formulation, and those with a history of asthma, urticaria (hives), or other allergic-type reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of renal (kidney) effects and serious skin reactions (SJS and TEN) even with topical use.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with other forms of asthma (excluding aspirin-sensitive asthma), elderly patients, and neonates.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Topical piroxicam should be avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy.  Systemic absorption, while generally low, is possible and may vary depending on dosage form and application site.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while using topical piroxicam as it may be excreted in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Piroxicam topical may interact with several medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking before starting piroxicam.  Examples of interactions include those with anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics.
