# Pasireotide Diaspartate
### Generic Name
Pasireotide Diaspartate

### Usage
Pasireotide diaspartate is a medication used to treat Cushing's disease in adults.  This condition occurs when the body produces too much cortisol, a hormone made by the adrenal glands.  It's primarily used in adults for whom pituitary surgery (the usual treatment) isn't an option or hasn't been successful in controlling the excess cortisol.  Pasireotide helps to lower cortisol levels by reducing the production of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), a hormone that stimulates cortisol production.

### Dosage
The dosage of pasireotide diaspartate is individualized and depends on the patient's response and tolerance.  It is typically administered subcutaneously (SC, under the skin) twice daily (bid).

* **Adults with Cushing's Disease:**  Treatment usually starts with 0.6-0.9 mg bid. The dosage is then adjusted based on how well it works and any side effects.  The dosage range is generally 0.3-0.9 mg bid.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is usually necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with liver problems. For those with mild impairment (Child-Pugh class A), no adjustment is needed.  For moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class B), the initial dose is typically 0.3 mg bid, and the maximum dose is 0.6 mg bid.  Pasireotide is generally avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).

### Side Effects
Pasireotide diaspartate, like many medications, can cause side effects.  The frequency of some of these is not fully established. Common or possible side effects include:

* Hypocortisolism (low levels of cortisol)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* QT prolongation (a change in the heart's electrical activity)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Cholelithiasis (gallstones)
* Pituitary hormone deficiency

If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Pasireotide diaspartate is a somatostatin analog.  Somatostatin is a hormone that naturally regulates the release of other hormones, including ACTH. Pasireotide works by binding to somatostatin receptors (sst receptors) on the cells in the pituitary gland that produce ACTH.  By binding to these receptors, it inhibits the release of ACTH.  This, in turn, leads to a decrease in cortisol production by the adrenal glands, helping to control the symptoms of Cushing's disease.  Pasireotide has a particular affinity for the sst5 receptor, frequently overexpressed in corticotroph tumors of Cushing's disease patients.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Pasireotide diaspartate should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to pasireotide or any of its components.
* **Contraindications:**  It's contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, uncontrolled diabetes, certain types of heart failure, certain heart rhythm problems (AV block, sinoatrial block, sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia), congenital long QT syndrome, or a baseline QTc interval of 500ms or greater.
* **Drug Interactions:** Pasireotide can interact with other medications, particularly those that prolong the QT interval (e.g., some anti-arrhythmic drugs), cyclosporine, and bromocriptine.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Pasireotide is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Its use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, and its excretion in breast milk is unknown, warranting caution.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Pasireotide?** A: The time it takes to see improvements varies depending on individual responses. Some patients might see a decrease in cortisol levels within weeks, while others may take longer.

* **Q: How is Pasireotide stored?** A: Store Pasireotide as directed by your pharmacist.  It typically needs refrigeration.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Pasireotide suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking Pasireotide without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation could lead to potential complications.  Dosage adjustments should always be made under medical supervision.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects associated with Pasireotide?** A: Long-term use may be associated with certain side effects.  Regular monitoring by your doctor is crucial to manage potential risks and adjust treatment as needed.  Discuss any concerns about long-term effects with your healthcare provider.
