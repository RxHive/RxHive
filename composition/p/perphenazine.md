# Perphenazine
### Generic Name
Perphenazine

### Usage
Perphenazine is primarily used to treat schizophrenia, a chronic mental illness characterized by disordered thinking, delusions, hallucinations, and emotional disturbances. It's also used to control severe nausea and vomiting, particularly when other treatments haven't been effective.  While it can be used in adults and children over 12, its use in children is generally being replaced by second-generation antipsychotics for schizophrenia.

### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's condition and response to treatment.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia:**  The initial oral dose is typically 4-8 mg three times daily (TID). This can be increased to a maximum of 24 mg daily for non-hospitalized patients or up to 64 mg daily for hospitalized patients under close medical supervision. The dose should be reduced as soon as possible to the lowest effective amount.
* **Nausea and Vomiting:** The usual oral dosage is 8-16 mg daily in divided doses. The dose should be decreased to the minimum effective amount as soon as possible, with a maximum of 24 mg/day.

**Children (12 years and older):**

Dosage for children 12 years and older is generally the same as for adults, however,  second-generation antipsychotics are preferred for treating schizophrenia in this population.  A doctor will carefully determine the appropriate and lowest effective dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Perphenazine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with liver damage.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is recommended, but use should be cautious.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Weight gain
* Restlessness
* Movement disorders (extrapyramidal symptoms like tremors, muscle stiffness, or uncontrolled movements)

Less common, but serious side effects:

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): A rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
* Tardive dyskinesia:  A late-onset movement disorder that can be irreversible.  Regular monitoring for this is necessary.
* Agranulocytosis: A severe decrease in white blood cells, increasing the risk of infections.  Regular blood tests are important.
* Jaundice: Yellowing of the skin or eyes, indicating liver problems.
* Photosensitivity: Increased sensitivity to sunlight.

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Perphenazine is a first-generation antipsychotic (also called a typical antipsychotic). It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes. By blocking these receptors, perphenazine helps to reduce symptoms of schizophrenia.  Its antiemetic effects are likely related to its interaction with dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain, which plays a role in initiating nausea and vomiting.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Perphenazine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, bone marrow suppression, blood dyscrasias (disorders of blood cells), liver damage, severe CNS depression, and subcortical brain damage.
* **Drug Interactions:** Perphenazine can interact with many other medications, including other antipsychotics, CNS depressants, and drugs that prolong the QT interval (can cause dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities).  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Perphenazine is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully understood. Use during pregnancy should only occur if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should carefully consider the risks and benefits with their physician.
* **Elderly Patients:** There's an increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis who use antipsychotics. Perphenazine is not approved for treating dementia-related psychosis.
* **Children:** While it can be used in children over 12, the use of second-generation antipsychotics is preferred for schizophrenia.
* **Patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or a history of seizures should be closely monitored when taking perphenazine.
