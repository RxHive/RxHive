# Procaterol
### Generic Name
Procaterol

### Usage
Procaterol is a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist (LABA) primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with respiratory obstructive diseases.  These include dyspnea (shortness of breath), and other symptoms of bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary emphysema. It's also indicated for the treatment of acute bronchitis.  Procaterol works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier.  It's important to note that Procaterol is generally used as an *additional* therapy alongside other treatments, particularly for long-term asthma management, and not as a standalone medication.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For respiratory obstructive disorders, the usual oral dosage is 50 mcg (10 mL of a 5 mcg/mL syrup) once daily (before bed) or twice daily (morning and bedtime).  This is for symptomatic relief of conditions like asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and acute bronchitis.

**Children (â‰¥6 years):** The usual oral dosage is 25 mcg (5 mL of a 5 mcg/mL syrup) once daily (before bed) or twice daily (morning and bedtime) for the same indications as adults.

**Children (<6 years):** The oral dosage is 1.25 mcg/kg body weight (0.25 mL/kg of a 5 mcg/mL syrup) twice daily (morning and bedtime) or three times daily (morning, early afternoon, and bedtime).  Always follow the prescription provided by a physician as the dosage will be tailored to the child's weight and condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for advice on dosage adjustments in patients with compromised organ function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Tremor
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Fatigue
* Nasal congestion
* Polydipsia (excessive thirst)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm)
* Ventricular arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
* Tachyarrhythmia (rapid, irregular heartbeat)
* Dysarthria (difficulty speaking)
* Drowsiness
* Insomnia


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Procaterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist.  This means it works by binding to specific beta-2 receptors found in the muscles lining the airways of the lungs.  This binding triggers a cascade of events that lead to the relaxation of these muscles, causing bronchodilation (widening of the airways).  The result is improved airflow into and out of the lungs, alleviating symptoms such as shortness of breath and wheezing.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Procaterol is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to procaterol or any of its components.

* **Warnings:**  Excessive use can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and arrest. Long-term use may increase the risk of acute asthma episodes.

* **Use with Caution:**  Procaterol should be used cautiously in patients with hyperthyroidism, hypertension (high blood pressure), or cardiovascular disease.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Procaterol should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. The safety of procaterol during pregnancy has not been established.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued before starting Procaterol treatment as excretion in breast milk is unknown.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to procaterol than younger individuals; dose adjustments may be necessary.

* **Allergy Testing:** Procaterol can interfere with allergy skin tests; it should be discontinued 12 hours before testing.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Procaterol suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Procaterol can worsen your respiratory condition. Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: Can I take Procaterol with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store Procaterol?** A: Store Procaterol as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Is Procaterol addictive?** A: Procaterol is not considered an addictive substance.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Is Procaterol suitable for long-term use?** A:  While Procaterol can be used for long-term management of certain respiratory conditions, it's often used in conjunction with other medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, which are considered the cornerstone of long-term asthma management.  Always follow your physician's recommendations for treatment.
