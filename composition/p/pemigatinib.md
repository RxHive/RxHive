# Pemigatinib
### Generic Name
Pemigatinib

### Usage
Pemigatinib is a targeted cancer therapy specifically used to treat adults with cholangiocarcinoma (a type of bile duct cancer).  Importantly, it's only used for patients whose cancer has already been treated and is either locally advanced (meaning it hasn't spread far but can't be surgically removed) or has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body).  The crucial factor is that the cancer must have a specific genetic abnormality: a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement. This abnormality is detectable through FDA-approved tests, and the presence of this genetic change is essential for Pemigatinib to be effective.

### Dosage
The standard oral dosage for adults with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (with a susceptible FGFR2 genetic alteration) is 13.5 mg once daily for 14 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day break. This constitutes a 21-day cycle. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are needed in certain situations.  For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, no adjustment is necessary.  However, the manufacturer's labeling does not provide guidance for severe hepatic or renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 mÂ² or end-stage renal disease).  Dosage modifications are also crucial if adverse reactions occur; this often involves dose reduction or, in severe cases, discontinuation of the drug. Specific guidelines for dose adjustments based on hyperphosphatemia and ocular toxicity are detailed in the prescribing information.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Pemigatinib have not been established in children.


### Side Effects
Pemigatinib can cause a range of side effects.  The following is not an exhaustive list, and the frequency varies among individuals:

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Peripheral edema
*   Abdominal pain
*   Constipation
*   Decreased appetite
*   Diarrhea
*   Altered taste (dysgeusia)
*   Nausea
*   Mouth sores (stomatitis)
*   Vomiting
*   Dry mouth (xerostomia)
*   Decreased hemoglobin
*   Changes in white blood cell counts (leukocytosis, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia)
*   Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
*   Hair loss (alpecia)
*   Nail changes
*   Redness and swelling of the palms and soles (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia)
*   Dry skin (xeroderma)
*   Changes in serum levels of albumin, calcium, glucose, potassium, sodium, and creatinine
*   Dehydration
*   Hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels)
*   Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels)
*   Increased uric acid
*   Weight loss
*   Urinary tract infections
*   Joint pain (arthralgia)
*   Back pain
*   Limb pain
*   Dry eye syndrome


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less frequently reported):**

*   Cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts)
*   Intestinal obstruction
*   Bone fractures
*   Acute kidney failure
*   Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (a serious eye condition)
*   Pleural effusion (fluid build-up around the lungs)
*   Fever


**Important Note:**  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Pemigatinib is a type of targeted therapy known as a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor.  It works by blocking the activity of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 enzymes. These enzymes are involved in cell growth and division. By inhibiting these enzymes, particularly FGFR2 in the context of the specific genetic alteration in cholangiocarcinoma, Pemigatinib interferes with the cancer cell's ability to grow and survive.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer.
* **Interactions:**  Pemigatinib's metabolism can be affected by other medications. Concomitant use with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers or inhibitors can alter Pemigatinib's levels in the body, impacting both efficacy and safety.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Pemigatinib can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.
* **Ocular Toxicity:**  Pemigatinib carries a risk of serious eye problems, such as retinal pigment epithelial detachment. Regular eye exams are crucial during treatment.
* **Hyperphosphatemia:**  Pemigatinib can elevate phosphate levels in the blood (hyperphosphatemia). Regular monitoring and management of phosphate levels are necessary.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function should be closely monitored.  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Pemigatinib with food?** A: Yes, Pemigatinib can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose by more than 4 hours or experience vomiting, take the next scheduled dose. Don't try to double up on doses.
* **Q: How should I store Pemigatinib?** A: Refer to the medication's label for specific storage instructions. Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  Is Pemigatinib right for everyone with cholangiocarcinoma?** A: No, it is only suitable for patients with a specific FGFR2 genetic alteration in their cholangiocarcinoma, as confirmed by an appropriate diagnostic test.  Your oncologist will determine if Pemigatinib is appropriate for your individual case.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Pemigatinib?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known; however, ongoing monitoring for potential long-term side effects is part of the treatment process.  Discuss any concerns with your physician.
