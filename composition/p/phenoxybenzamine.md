# Phenoxybenzamine
### Generic Name
Phenoxybenzamine

### Usage
Phenoxybenzamine is primarily used to treat pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that causes the body to release excessive amounts of adrenaline and noradrenaline.  This leads to episodes of dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension) and excessive sweating. Phenoxybenzamine helps control these episodes by blocking the effects of these hormones.  It's crucial in managing hypertension before surgery for pheochromocytoma.  While not its primary use, phenoxybenzamine has also been used off-label to treat certain micturition disorders (problems with urination).


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Pheochromocytoma (Oral):**  Treatment begins with a low dose (10 mg twice daily) and is gradually increased every other day until blood pressure is controlled.  The maintenance dose typically ranges from 20-40 mg twice or three times daily.
* **Pheochromocytoma (Intravenous):** For severe cases (shock) or as a surgical preventative measure, a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day is given intravenously over at least 2 hours.  This is usually administered with a saline solution.
* **Micturition Disorders (Oral):**  The typical dose is 10-20 mg once or twice daily.

**Pediatric Dosage (Pheochromocytoma, Preoperative Management):**

* Oral: Treatment begins with a lower dose (0.2-0.25 mg/kg once or twice daily) and is carefully titrated upwards (e.g., every 4 days) until the desired effect is seen.  The maximum single dose is 10 mg, and the maximum daily dose is 4 mg/kg.  Maintenance doses are variable and determined on a case-by-case basis.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Inhibited ejaculation
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Gastrointestinal irritation (e.g., nausea)
* Miosis (constriction of the pupils)
* Nasal congestion

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can occur.  If any adverse effects develop, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective, non-competitive, irreversible alpha-blocker. This means it binds permanently to alpha-adrenergic receptors, preventing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding.  These receptors are found in blood vessels and other tissues. By blocking these receptors, phenoxybenzamine prevents vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and reduces the effects of these hormones, leading to lowered blood pressure and reduced sweating.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Phenoxybenzamine should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the medication or in situations where a drop in blood pressure is dangerous.
* **Interactions:**  Phenoxybenzamine can interact with various medications, including other antihypertensives, alpha/beta agonists, and MAOIs.  This can lead to increased hypotension or other adverse effects.  It's vital to inform a healthcare provider of all medications being taken.
* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory infections, porphyria, and older adults. It should be used with caution in patients with cerebral or coronary atherosclerosis.  Formulations containing benzyl alcohol are not recommended for neonates due to the risk of gasping syndrome.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Phenoxybenzamine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown. The decision to continue breastfeeding or discontinue the medication should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, considering the benefits of the treatment for the mother.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Phenoxybenzamine to work?** A: The onset and duration of action vary.  The effects can be noticeable within a few hours of the first dose, but it takes longer to achieve full therapeutic effects.  It's a long-acting drug, so effects persist even after the medication is stopped.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Phenoxybenzamine?** A: Alcohol can worsen the hypotensive effects of Phenoxybenzamine, so it's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Q: How should I store Phenoxybenzamine?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is Phenoxybenzamine a long-term treatment?** A:  No, prolonged use isnâ€™t generally recommended due to potential long-term risks. It is usually used for specific conditions like preoperative management of pheochromocytoma or short-term management of specific symptoms.
