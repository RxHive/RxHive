# Perflutren Lipid Microspheres
### Generic Name
Perflutren Lipid Microspheres

### Usage
Perflutren lipid microspheres are primarily used as a diagnostic agent in echocardiography.  Its main purpose is to improve the visualization of the left ventricle's endocardial border in patients whose echocardiograms are suboptimal (meaning the images are not clear enough for proper diagnosis). This enhanced visualization helps clinicians better assess the structure and function of the left ventricle, aiding in the diagnosis of various cardiovascular conditions.  While its primary use is in cardiovascular imaging, off-label use for evaluating focal liver lesions has also been reported.


### Dosage

**Cardiovascular Imaging (Adult):**

* **Intravenous (IV) Bolus:** 10 mL/kg of the *activated* product, followed immediately by a 10 mL saline flush.  A second dose may be given after 30 minutes if needed, again followed by a 10 mL saline flush.  The maximum dose per imaging study is two bolus doses.
* **Intravenous (IV) Infusion:**  Begin with an infusion rate of 4 mL/minute (or 240 mL/hour) of the prepared infusion. Adjust the rate, as needed, to achieve optimal image quality, up to a maximum of 10 mL/minute (or 600 mL/hour). The maximum dose per imaging study is one IV infusion.

**Important Note (Cardiovascular Imaging):**  Dosage should follow a baseline non-contrast echocardiogram. Imaging begins immediately after administration and is compared to the non-contrast images. The ultrasound device's mechanical index should be set at ≤ 0.8.

**Focal Liver Lesion Evaluation (Off-Label, Adult):**

* **Intravenous (IV) Bolus:** 0.1–0.6 mL per injection, followed by a 5 mL saline flush.  Repeat injections may be given at least every 5 minutes (after most microbubbles have disappeared), up to a maximum total dose of 10 mL/kg.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of perflutren lipid microspheres in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Flushing
* Nausea
* Back pain
* Renal pain

**Less Common (<1%):**  A wide range of less common side effects have been reported across various body systems, including:  dizziness, fatigue, cardiovascular symptoms (bradycardia, hypertension, etc.), skin reactions, gastrointestinal issues, hematologic changes, and others.  A complete list is available in the detailed product information.

**Post-Marketing Reports:** Serious adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, serious cardiopulmonary events, and other severe symptoms, have been reported after the drug's release to the market.

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Perflutren lipid microspheres are composed of perfluorocarbon gas encapsulated within a lipid shell. When injected intravenously and activated, these microspheres act as ultrasound contrast agents.  They circulate in the bloodstream and enhance the echogenicity (ability to reflect ultrasound waves) of the blood within the left ventricle. This improved echogenicity leads to clearer images during echocardiography, making it easier to visualize the endocardial borders and assess the left ventricular function.


### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** Perflutren lipid microspheres are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to perflutren or any component of the formulation, including polyethylene glycol.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of serious cardiopulmonary reactions and hypersensitivity reactions.  There's also an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly if high ultrasound mechanical indices are used.
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with cardiac shunts to monitor for potential embolic phenomena.
* **Boxed Warning:** Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities, have been reported.  Resuscitation equipment and trained personnel should be readily available during and after administration.
* **Pregnancy & Lactation:**  It's categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  While the short half-life minimizes fetal exposure,  excretion in breast milk is unknown.  The decision to breastfeed should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider considering the benefits and risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: There are different formulations, some requiring refrigeration and others room temperature storage. Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.
* **Q: How long does the medication take to work?** A: The effect is immediate, enhancing echocardiographic images upon administration.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A:  No specific dietary restrictions are typically associated with perflutren lipid microspheres.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  This medication is typically used for a single imaging procedure, not a continuous dosing regimen.  If there's a need for repeated imaging, consult your healthcare provider.
* **Q: Can I take other medications with this?** A: Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to assess potential interactions.
