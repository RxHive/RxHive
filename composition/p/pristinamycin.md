# Pristinamycin
### Generic Name
Pristinamycin

### Usage

Pristinamycin is an antibacterial medication primarily used to treat several bacterial infections.  Its main applications include:

* **Acute maxillary sinusitis:**  Infection of the sinuses located in the cheekbones, causing pain, pressure, and congestion.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** Infections affecting the skin and underlying tissues, ranging from minor infections like cellulitis to more serious conditions like abscesses.
* **Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis:** A worsening of symptoms in individuals with long-term bronchitis, characterized by increased cough, mucus production, and shortness of breath.
* **Mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia:** Lung infection acquired outside of a hospital setting, typically not requiring intensive care.

It's crucial to remember that Pristinamycin is effective only against specific bacteria.  A doctor will conduct tests to ensure the infection is caused by susceptible bacteria before prescribing this medication.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, and their overall health.  Always follow the prescribing doctor's instructions carefully.

**Adults (Oral):**

The usual daily dose ranges from 2 to 4 grams, divided into multiple doses throughout the day.  Specific dosage for individual conditions:

* **Acute maxillary sinusitis:** 1 gram twice daily (BID) for four days. Higher doses may be used in severe cases.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** 1 gram twice or three times daily (BID or TID) for 8-14 days. Higher doses may be used in severe cases.
* **Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis:** 1 gram three times daily (TID) for four days. Higher doses may be used in severe cases.
* **Mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia:** 1 gram three times daily (TID) for 7-14 days. Higher doses may be used in severe cases.


**Children (Oral):**

The typical dose is 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into two or three doses.  In severe cases, this might increase to 100 mg/kg/day, but it should never exceed the adult dosage.  For children under 6 years old, crushing the tablets and mixing them with milk or a sweet substance might be necessary, but always confirm with a healthcare provider first.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, it is essential to inform your doctor of any kidney or liver problems before taking this medication.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:


* Gastrointestinal issues: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastric heaviness.
* Skin reactions: Rash, urticaria (hives).


Less common, but serious side effects:

* Pseudomembranous colitis (a serious bowel infection)
* Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a severe skin reaction
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reactions)
* Acute renal failure (kidney failure)
* Anaphylactic shock (life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Pancytopenia (reduction in all blood cell types)

If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking Pristinamycin and immediately contact your doctor.

### How it Works

Pristinamycin is a type of antibiotic called a streptogramin. It works by binding to the bacterial ribosome (the protein-making machinery of the bacteria), thereby preventing the bacteria from producing essential proteins.  This ultimately stops the bacteria's growth and kills them.  It's important to understand that Pristinamycin targets bacterial cells and has limited effect on human cells.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Do not take Pristinamycin if you have a known allergy to it or other streptogramins.
* **Severe Skin Reactions:**  A history of severe skin reactions (AGEP, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), or vasculitis) after taking Pristinamycin is a contraindication.
* **Colchicine Interaction:**  Avoid concomitant use with colchicine due to increased risk of serious adverse events.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks. It is excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding contraindicated during treatment.
* **Other Interactions:** Pristinamycin may interact with several other medications, including oral anticoagulants (blood thinners), cyclosporine (an immunosuppressant), and other immunosuppressants.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Wheat Allergy:** Pristinamycin formulations may contain wheat, so it is contraindicated in people with wheat allergy (excluding celiac disease).



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Pristinamycin for a sore throat?**  A: No, Pristinamycin is not effective against viral infections like those causing most sore throats.
* **Q: How should I store Pristinamycin?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Pristinamycin early if I feel better?** A: No, always complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if symptoms improve.  Stopping early may lead to treatment failure and increase the risk of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: Are there any specific monitoring requirements while taking Pristinamycin?** A:  Your doctor may monitor your liver function with regular blood tests, and a culture and sensitivity test might be performed before treatment to confirm the bacteria causing your infection.
