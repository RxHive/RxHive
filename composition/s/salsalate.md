# Salsalate
### Generic Name
Salsalate

### Usage
Salsalate is a salicylate medication primarily used to relieve the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other related rheumatic disorders.  It's an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) that works to reduce pain and inflammation in the joints. While its primary use is in treating these chronic conditions, it's not typically used for acute pain relief like a headache or minor injury.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Rheumatic Disorders):** The typical adult dose is 3 grams per day, divided into two to three separate administrations.  The specific dosage will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual response and the severity of symptoms.  The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest necessary duration.  Salsalate is usually available in tablet form.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of salsalate in children have not been established, and therefore it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, especially in patients with advanced renal disease, where use is generally not recommended.  Always consult a doctor before using salsalate if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Abdominal pain
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vertigo
*   Skin rash

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

*   Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Anemia
*   Liver problems (abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis)
*   Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*   Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but serious skin reaction)
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis (another rare but severe skin reaction)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as more serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Salsalate works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and pain.  It's thought that its anti-inflammatory effects are primarily due to its inhibition of platelet aggregation (the clumping of blood platelets), though this effect is less pronounced than that of aspirin. After ingestion, salsalate is metabolized in the body to salicylic acid, the active component responsible for its therapeutic effects.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Salsalate should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to salsalate or any of its components, aspirin, or other NSAIDs. It's also contraindicated in patients with asthma, urticaria (hives), or allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs, and is specifically contraindicated for perioperative pain in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

**Interactions:** Salsalate can interact with other medications, including aspirin and other salicylates (additive effects, potentially leading to toxic levels), furosemide and thiazides (reducing their effect), and methotrexate (increasing its serum concentration).  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting salsalate.

**Warnings:** Salsalate carries risks of cardiovascular thrombotic events (like heart attack and stroke), serious gastrointestinal problems (ulceration, bleeding, perforation), and various allergic or hypersensitivity reactions. Patients with existing cardiovascular disease, kidney or liver problems, or a history of gastrointestinal issues should exercise particular caution.  The medication should be used with caution in the elderly, during pregnancy (especially late pregnancy), and while breastfeeding.  Smoking and alcohol use can increase the risk of side effects.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take salsalate with other pain relievers?** A: No, you shouldn't take salsalate with other NSAIDs or salicylates without consulting your doctor. This could lead to dangerous interactions and increase the risk of side effects.
