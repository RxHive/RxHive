# Strontium Chloride Sr 89
### Generic Name
Strontium Chloride Sr 89

### Usage
Strontium Chloride Sr 89 is a radioactive medication used to alleviate bone pain in patients suffering from painful skeletal metastases (cancer that has spread to the bones).  It's crucial to understand that this drug is *not* suitable for treating cancers that haven't spread to the bones.  Because pain relief can take 7 to 20 days to manifest, it's also not appropriate for patients with a short life expectancy.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  The presence of bone metastases must be confirmed before treatment.  The typical intravenous (IV) dose is 148 MBq (4 mCi) or 1.5–2.2 MBq/kg (40–60 microCi/kg), administered slowly over 1–2 minutes.  Repeat doses may be considered after at least 90 days, depending on the patient's response, symptoms, and blood count.  Precise dosage should be measured immediately before administration using a calibrated radioactivity system.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Strontium Chloride Sr 89 in children under 18 years old haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, for patients with kidney problems, a careful benefit-risk assessment is necessary due to the drug's extensive renal excretion.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Flushing (after rapid injection)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Ostealgia (bone pain)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Chills
* Fever
* Hot flashes
* Septicemia (blood poisoning)

If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Strontium Chloride Sr 89 works by acting as a calcium analog. After intravenous injection, it's rapidly cleared from the bloodstream and selectively accumulates in bone mineral.  This uptake is greater in areas of active bone formation, meaning that primary bone tumors and metastatic sites (blastic lesions) concentrate higher levels of Strontium Chloride Sr 89 compared to healthy bone.  The drug remains in the metastatic bone lesions significantly longer.  Because Strontium Chloride Sr 89 is a beta-emitter, it irradiates these sites of cancer growth while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding soft tissues. The radiation's maximum tissue range is 8 mm, with a maximum energy of 1.463 MeV.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Strontium Chloride Sr 89 is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

**Warnings and Increased Risks:**  Use caution in patients with low platelet counts (<60,000/mm³) or low white blood cell counts (<2400/mm³).  There's an increased risk of bone marrow toxicity (thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), transient increases in bone pain (36–72 hours post-administration), and a calcium-like flushing sensation.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Strontium Chloride Sr 89 is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus. Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy.  The excretion of this drug in breast milk is unknown, so breastfeeding should be discontinued before treatment.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Strontium Chloride Sr 89 to work?**
A: Pain relief typically begins 7-20 days after administration.


**Q: How is Strontium Chloride Sr 89 administered?**
A: It's administered intravenously as a slow injection over 1-2 minutes.


**Q: What are the precautions regarding handling Strontium Chloride Sr 89?**
A:  Because this is a radioactive substance, appropriate handling, disposal, and safety precautions are crucial to minimize exposure to patients and healthcare personnel.  It should only be used under the supervision of trained professionals. Patients should also take precautions to minimize radioactive contamination of their clothing and environment.

**Q:  How often will I need blood tests?**
A: Your doctor will likely order regular complete blood counts (CBC) with differentials, at least every other week, to monitor for side effects.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects.
