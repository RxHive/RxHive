# Selpercatinib
### Generic Name
Selpercatinib

### Usage
Selpercatinib is a targeted cancer medication, specifically a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  It's also approved for treating medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), both RET-mutant and RET fusion-positive forms.  In essence, it targets cancers driven by specific genetic alterations in the RET gene.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical oral dose is 160 mg twice daily (BID) for patients weighing 50 kg or more, and 120 mg BID for those weighing less than 50 kg. This dose is maintained until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects emerge.  The dosage is the same for both lung and thyroid cancers.

**Children (12 years and older):**  Similar to adults, children 12 years and older receive 160 mg BID if they weigh 50 kg or more, and 120 mg BID if they weigh less.  The medication is given orally.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for certain situations.  Patients with severe hepatic impairment may require a dose reduction.  Renal impairment generally doesn't necessitate dose adjustments, but monitoring is crucial.  Dose reductions are also implemented to manage side effects like elevated liver enzymes, hypertension, or hemorrhagic events.  Specific adjustments depend on the severity and type of adverse reaction; always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage adjustments.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Edema (swelling)
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
*   Skin rash
*   Changes in blood serum levels (albumin, calcium, glucose, magnesium, sodium, cholesterol, potassium)
*   Gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth)
*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Increased serum creatinine (indicator of kidney function)
*   Cough
*   Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
*   Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
*   Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Hemorrhage (bleeding)
*   Severe liver damage
*   Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
*   QT prolongation (heart rhythm abnormality)
*   Tumor lysis syndrome (rapid breakdown of cancer cells)
*   Pneumonia


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Selpercatinib is a highly selective inhibitor of RET (rearranged during transfection) kinase.  RET is a protein involved in cell growth and communication.  In certain cancers, RET is mutated or rearranged, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Selpercatinib blocks the activity of RET, thereby hindering cancer cell proliferation and potentially leading to tumor shrinkage.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Currently, there are no specific contraindications reported in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, careful consideration is required in patients with certain conditions.
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists, and locally-acting antacids should be approached cautiously, with potential timing adjustments to minimize interaction.  Consult with a physician or pharmacist regarding potential interactions with other medications.
* **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before starting selpercatinib.  The drug's use in children younger than 12 years old has not been fully established.  Careful monitoring is essential for older adults due to their increased susceptibility to adverse reactions.  Females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take selpercatinib with food?**

A: Selpercatinib can be taken with or without food, except when co-administered with certain acid-reducing agents.  Specific timing recommendations apply when used with PPIs, H2 blockers, or antacids. Follow your doctor's or pharmacist's advice.

**Q: How should I store selpercatinib?**

A: Store selpercatinib as directed on the prescription label, usually at room temperature.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose.

**Q: What are the long-term effects of selpercatinib?**

A: The long-term effects are not fully known.  Regular monitoring is essential to detect and manage potential long-term side effects.

**Q: Is selpercatinib suitable for all types of cancer?**

A: No, selpercatinib is specifically targeted at cancers with RET gene alterations.  It's not suitable for all cancers.
