# Stavudine
### Generic Name
Stavudine

### Usage
Stavudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) primarily used in the treatment of HIV-1 infection.  It's crucial to understand that stavudine is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral medications; it is never used as a monotherapy.  This combination approach is essential for effective HIV management and to minimize the development of drug resistance.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (HIV infection):** Stavudine is administered orally. Dosage depends on body weight and renal function.  Always consult a physician for precise dosage instructions.

* **Patients weighing <60 kg:** 30 mg twice daily (BID).
* **Patients weighing ≥60 kg:** 40 mg BID.

**Pediatric Dosage (HIV-1 infection):** Dosage is weight-based and administered orally.  Again, a physician should determine the appropriate dose.

* **Infants and children weighing <30 kg:** 1 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours (maximum dose: 30 mg/dose).
* **Children and adolescents weighing 30 to <60 kg:** 30 mg every 12 hours.
* **Adolescents weighing ≥60 kg:** 40 mg every 12 hours.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired renal function.  No specific adjustments are provided for hepatic impairment, but caution is advised.  The prescribing physician should adjust the dosage based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels.  For example, in patients with a CrCl of 10-25 mL/min, the dosage is significantly reduced.  Stavudine is dialyzable, and dosage adjustments are necessary for patients undergoing hemodialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in the extremities)
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) – can be fatal
* Lactic acidosis (buildup of lactic acid in the blood) – can be fatal
* Hepatomegaly with steatosis (enlarged liver with fatty deposits) – can be fatal
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
* Lipoatrophy (loss of fat tissue under the skin)
*  Severe neuromuscular weakness


**Important Note:**  This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any concerning side effects, including those not listed here, immediately contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Stavudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.  It works by interfering with the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which HIV needs to replicate. By inhibiting reverse transcriptase, stavudine prevents the virus from converting its RNA into DNA, thus halting viral replication and slowing the progression of the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Stavudine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components and in those concurrently taking didanosine (DDI).
* **Interactions:** Stavudine interacts with several other medications.  It can decrease the effectiveness of other antiviral drugs. Concurrent use with drugs that cause pancreatitis or peripheral neuropathy increases the risk of these side effects.  Concurrent use with didanosine is contraindicated due to a significantly increased risk of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis.
* **Warnings:** Stavudine carries a boxed warning regarding the risk of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, both potentially fatal conditions. It also carries a boxed warning about the risk of pancreatitis, particularly when used with didanosine.  Close monitoring of liver function and signs of pancreatitis is crucial.  Patients with pre-existing liver disease, renal impairment, peripheral neuropathy, or bone marrow suppression should use stavudine with extreme caution.  Pregnant women should carefully discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider. Breastfeeding is contraindicated in HIV-infected mothers.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take stavudine with other medications?** A:  Stavudine interacts with many drugs.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Q: How should I store stavudine?** A: Store stavudine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.
* **Q:  Is stavudine safe for pregnant women?** A: The safety of stavudine during pregnancy has not been fully established.  The potential benefits of treatment must be weighed against the potential risks to the fetus.
* **Q: Can I stop taking stavudine without consulting my doctor?** A: No. Abruptly stopping stavudine can lead to adverse effects and potentially allow HIV to develop resistance to the medication. Always discuss any changes to your treatment plan with your healthcare provider.
