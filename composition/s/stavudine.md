# Stavudine

**Generic Name:** Stavudine

**Usage:** Stavudine is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection. It's typically used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  It's not a first-line treatment anymore due to the availability of better tolerated and more effective drugs.  Its use is largely restricted to situations where other drugs are not tolerated or are ineffective.

**Side Effects:** Stavudine can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, weakness, peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet), lactic acidosis (a rare but serious buildup of lactic acid in the blood), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
* **Serious side effects:**  Lipodystrophy (changes in body fat distribution),  hepatotoxicity (liver damage), myopathy (muscle damage), cardiomyopathy (heart muscle damage),  bone marrow suppression (leading to decreased blood cell counts),  peripheral neuropathy (severe cases can lead to disability).


**How it Works:** Stavudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).  It works by interfering with the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme HIV needs to replicate itself.  Specifically, stavudine is incorporated into the viral DNA during replication, preventing the virus from making copies of itself and halting its spread.


**FAQs:**

* **Is stavudine a first-line treatment for HIV?** No, due to its side effects and the availability of better-tolerated and more effective drugs, stavudine is generally not used as a first-line treatment for HIV.
* **What are the risks associated with stavudine?**  The main risks are peripheral neuropathy, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, and lipodystrophy. Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and blood sugar is necessary.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking stavudine?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage and should be avoided or consumed in moderation while taking stavudine.  Consult with your doctor.
* **How is stavudine administered?** Stavudine is typically taken orally in tablet form. The dosage is determined by your doctor and depends on your individual needs and health status.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **What are the interactions with other drugs?** Stavudine may interact with other medications, including other antiretrovirals. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Can I stop taking stavudine if I feel better?**  No, you should never stop taking stavudine or any other HIV medication without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to drug resistance and a worsening of the infection.
