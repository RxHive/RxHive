# Sodium aminosalicylate + Isoniazid
### Generic Name
Sodium aminosalicylate + Isoniazid

**Note:**  This combination is not a single, pre-mixed generic medication with an official name like "Sodium aminosalicylate/Isoniazid." Instead, it refers to the simultaneous administration of these two drugs, often prescribed together to treat tuberculosis (TB).  Information below reflects the combined use of these two distinct medications.  Always refer to individual prescribing information for each component drug.


### Usage

This combination is primarily used to treat tuberculosis (TB), a serious bacterial infection affecting the lungs and potentially other organs.  Sodium aminosalicylate (PAS) and isoniazid (INH) are both anti-tuberculosis drugs that work through different mechanisms to combat the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria. Using them together enhances the effectiveness of the treatment and reduces the risk of the bacteria developing resistance.  While primarily used for pulmonary TB, it can also be part of a treatment regimen for extra-pulmonary TB (TB in other parts of the body).  The use of this combination is usually part of a wider multi-drug regimen as advised by a physician, rather than a standalone treatment.

### Dosage

**Dosage must be determined and prescribed by a physician. The information below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.** Dosage varies widely depending on several factors, including:

* **The patient's age and weight:**  Children will receive lower doses adjusted to their weight and age.
* **The severity and type of TB:**  More extensive or drug-resistant TB may require higher doses or a longer treatment duration.
* **Other health conditions:**  Kidney or liver impairment, for example, might necessitate dose adjustments to avoid complications.
* **Individual response to the medication:**  Doctors monitor patients for effectiveness and may adjust the dosage accordingly.

**Typical Adult Dosage (Example - This is NOT a prescription):**  The specific dosage of PAS and INH will be prescribed individually by the physician. It often involves a daily or twice-daily regimen, typically for six to nine months (or longer, depending on the specific requirements).


**Pediatric Dosage:** Pediatric dosing requires careful calculation based on the child's weight and age. A physician will determine the appropriate dosage.


**Oral Administration:** Both PAS and INH are usually administered orally in tablet or capsule form.

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:**  While less common for these specific drugs in TB treatment, IV administration might be considered under specific circumstances determined by a physician.

**Important:**  Always strictly follow the physician's instructions for dosage and administration.  Never alter the prescribed dose or frequency without consulting the doctor.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (PAS):**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Loss of appetite
* Headache
* Fatigue


**Common Side Effects (INH):**

* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in extremities)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) - this is a serious side effect
* Nausea and vomiting
* Dizziness
* Rash


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Both PAS and INH):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Blood disorders
* Severe liver damage


**Important:** This list is not exhaustive. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

**Sodium aminosalicylate (PAS):**  PAS's exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to interfere with the metabolism of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, inhibiting bacterial growth and ultimately killing the bacteria.

**Isoniazid (INH):** INH inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, which is essential for the cell wall of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* bacteria. By disrupting this process, INH prevents the bacteria from replicating and causes their death.  The combined action of PAS and INH significantly increases the effectiveness of TB treatment.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with known allergies to PAS or INH should not use these medications.
* **Liver Disease:**  Both PAS and INH can cause liver damage, so individuals with pre-existing liver conditions require careful monitoring. Liver function tests are routinely performed during treatment.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Patients with impaired kidney function may require dosage adjustments.
* **Peripheral Neuropathy:** INH can cause peripheral neuropathy, which is often preventable or managed by taking pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplements.
* **Drug Interactions:**  PAS and INH can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking these drugs as it may increase the risk of liver damage.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment is determined by your physician and depends on the severity of your TB and your response to treatment. It usually ranges from six to nine months but could be longer.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose. Consult your physician or pharmacist if unsure.

* **Q: Can I stop taking the medication once I feel better?** A: No. Completing the full course of treatment is crucial, even if you feel better. Stopping early increases the risk of drug resistance and a relapse of the infection.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Serious side effects include severe allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling, rash), jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), severe abdominal pain, and unusual bleeding or bruising. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.
