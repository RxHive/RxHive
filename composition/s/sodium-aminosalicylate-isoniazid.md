# Sodium aminosalicylate + Isoniazid

**Generic Name:** Sodium aminosalicylate + Isoniazid (Note:  This combination is not a standard, pre-made fixed-dose combination readily available.  It's more common to prescribe each medication separately.)

**Usage:** This combination is *not* a standard pharmaceutical preparation.  Sodium aminosalicylate (PAS) and isoniazid (INH) are used separately, but often together, in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  PAS is primarily used as a second-line agent in TB treatment, particularly in cases of multi-drug resistant TB, or when INH alone isn't effective. INH is a first-line antibiotic used in most TB treatment regimens.  A physician would prescribe the dosages of each drug individually based on the patient's condition and other factors.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects listed below are for each drug individually, as they would be experienced if used concurrently.

* **Sodium aminosalicylate (PAS):**  Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), anorexia, headache, fever, rash, hepatitis (liver inflammation), blood disorders (rare).  Some individuals may develop a hypersensitivity reaction.

* **Isoniazid (INH):**  Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling in the extremities), hepatitis (liver inflammation), rash, fever, drug-induced lupus (a type of autoimmune disease), seizures (rare, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions), optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve).


**How it Works:**

* **Sodium aminosalicylate (PAS):** The exact mechanism isn't fully understood but it's believed to interfere with bacterial cell wall synthesis, inhibiting the growth and multiplication of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

* **Isoniazid (INH):**  INH is a bactericidal drug. It inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, which is essential for the cell wall of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  This leads to cell death.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Why aren't PAS and INH usually combined in a single pill?** A: The individual dosages of PAS and INH are highly variable depending on the patient's health and the specific TB treatment regimen.  A fixed combination would not allow for the necessary flexibility in dosing.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes. Both PAS and INH can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some potential interactions include those with certain liver medications, anticonvulsants, and others.

* **Q: How long is the treatment course?** A: The duration of treatment varies considerably depending on the severity of the infection, the patient's response to treatment, and the presence of drug resistance.  Treatment regimens can last from several months to over a year.

* **Q: What are the monitoring requirements?** A: Regular monitoring of liver function (through blood tests) is essential, especially with INH, due to the risk of hepatitis.  Periodic blood counts may also be necessary.
