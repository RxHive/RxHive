# Sulphacetamide + Boric Acid + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate

**Generic Name:** Sulfacetamide + Boric Acid + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate

**Usage:** This combination is typically used topically as an ophthalmic solution (eye drops) to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other superficial bacterial infections of the eye.  The specific roles of each ingredient are:

* **Sulfacetamide:** An antimicrobial sulfonamide that inhibits bacterial growth.
* **Boric Acid:** A mild antiseptic that helps to reduce inflammation and irritation.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** An astringent that helps to dry up secretions and reduce inflammation.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, but may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation upon application
* Temporary blurring of vision
* Eye irritation
* Allergic reactions (itching, swelling, rash)  â€“  This is more likely if you have a known allergy to sulfa drugs.


**How it Works:**

This combination medication works through a synergistic effect of its components.  Sulfacetamide directly combats bacterial infection by interfering with bacterial folic acid synthesis, which is essential for bacterial growth and reproduction. Boric acid offers an antiseptic action, killing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms, while also reducing inflammation. Zinc sulfate acts as an astringent, helping to reduce the volume of eye discharge and minimizing inflammation.  The combined effect is a more effective treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis than any single ingredient alone.
