# Sulphacetamide + Boric Acid + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate
### Generic Name
Sulphacetamide + Boric Acid + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used topically (applied to the skin or eyes) to treat bacterial infections of the eye and eyelid.  The individual components work synergistically:

* **Sulfacetamide:** This is a sulfa antibiotic effective against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria commonly causing eye infections like conjunctivitis (pink eye).
* **Boric Acid:** Acts as a mild antiseptic, helping to further reduce bacterial growth and soothe inflammation.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Possesses astringent properties, helping to reduce swelling and discharge associated with eye infections.

The combination is frequently used for bacterial conjunctivitis, blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), and other superficial bacterial infections of the eye. It's important to note that this medication is **not** effective against viral or fungal infections of the eye.  A proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional is crucial before using this medication.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., ophthalmic solution, ointment) and the severity of the infection.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally:

* **Ophthalmic Solution:** Typically, one or two drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) every 2 to 4 hours, as directed by a physician.
* **Ophthalmic Ointment:** A small amount is applied to the affected eye(s) usually 2-4 times daily.

**Children:** Dosage for children is usually determined by their age and the severity of the infection.  A doctor will provide specific instructions.  **Never** administer this medication to a child without consulting a physician.

**IV Administration:** This medication is not intended for intravenous (IV) administration. It is for topical use only.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Burning or stinging sensation upon application, temporary blurry vision, mild itching.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), severe eye irritation, persistent eye pain, vision changes.  In rare cases, sulfa drugs can cause serious blood disorders.

**If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.**


### How it Works

This combination medication works through a multi-pronged approach:

* **Sulfacetamide:** Interferes with the bacterial synthesis of folic acid, a crucial component for bacterial growth and reproduction.  By inhibiting folic acid production, sulfacetamide effectively stops bacterial multiplication.
* **Boric Acid:**  Disrupts the cell membranes of bacteria, leading to bacterial death. Its antiseptic action also helps create an environment less conducive to bacterial growth.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Possesses astringent properties, constricting blood vessels and reducing inflammation and discharge. This helps alleviate the symptoms of the eye infection.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not use this medication if you have a known allergy to sulfa drugs, boric acid, zinc, or any other ingredients in the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Interactions with other medications are rare but possible.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying the medication and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Eye Injury:** Do not use this medication if you have a significant eye injury or corneal ulcer.
* **Children and Older Adults:** Use with caution in children and older adults; close monitoring is advised.
