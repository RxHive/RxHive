# Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate
### Generic Name
Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate

### Usage

Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate is a sclerosing agent primarily used to treat small, uncomplicated varicose veins in the lower extremities.  It's specifically indicated for veins exhibiting simple dilation with competent valves.  This means the medication is effective for varicose veins that are enlarged but haven't yet caused significant valve damage or other complications.  It's not suitable for all types of varicose veins.


### Dosage

The dosage of Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate varies significantly depending on the size and severity of the varicose veins being treated.  The solution comes in different concentrations (0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, and 3%), with the choice of concentration depending on the vein's diameter.  Administration is always intravenous (IV).

**Adults:**

* **Before any treatment:** A test dose is crucial.  For 0.2% and 0.5% solutions, a 0.25-0.5 mL test dose is given several hours before the main injection. For 1% and 3% solutions, a 0.5 mL test dose is administered with several hours of observation before proceeding. This helps detect any hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Treatment Dose:** The amount injected into each vein varies, generally ranging from 0.1 to 2 mL. The maximum dose for any single treatment session is 10 mL, but the preferred maximum for 3% solutions is 1 mL per vein. The concentration used depends on the affected vein's diameter, ranging from 0.1-0.3% for veins less than 1 mm, to 2-3% for larger branch varicosities. Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are rare, but those reported (often in less than 1% of patients, or from post-marketing surveillance and case reports) include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Urticaria (hives)

Serious, but less common side effects, may include:

* Anaphylactic shock
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Asthma exacerbation
* Cardiac insufficiency (heart failure)
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Transient ischemic attack (TIA or "mini-stroke")


**Important:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate works by irritating the inner lining (intima) of the varicose vein. This irritation leads to the formation of a blood clot (thrombosis) that eventually closes off the affected vein.  This process eliminates the dilated vein, resolving the varicose vein problem.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to the medication or its components
* Acute superficial thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a superficial vein)
* Valvular or deep vein incompetence (damaged valves or deep vein issues)
* Phlebitis migrans (a rare condition involving migrating inflammation of veins)
* Acute cellulitis (skin infection)
* Acute infections
* Allergic conditions (including uncontrolled asthma)
* Bedridden patients
* Uncontrolled systemic diseases (diabetes, hyperthyroidism, tuberculosis, etc.)
* Large superficial veins with extensive connections to deeper veins
* Varicosities caused by abdominal or pelvic tumors (unless the tumor has been removed)
* Recent superficial or deep thrombophlebitis (within 6 months to 2 years)
* Potential underlying arterial disease
* Renal or cardiac insufficiencies with venous stasis and dilatation
* Angina pectoris (chest pain due to heart disease)
* Hyperthyroidism

**Warnings:** Increased risk of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, and impaired cardiac function may be observed.  There is also an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

**Use with caution in:** Patients with peripheral arteriosclerosis, thromboangiitis obliterans, and nursing women.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment take?** A: The treatment itself is relatively short, involving a series of injections. The total treatment duration depends on the number and size of varicose veins.
* **Q: Is this treatment painful?** A: Some discomfort is possible during the injection, but pain levels are generally manageable.  Your doctor can discuss pain management options.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Results are not immediate.  The treated veins gradually close over time. Complete resolution may take several weeks.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor immediately.
* **Q: How should I store the medication?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  It usually involves storing the medication at room temperature and away from light and moisture.
* **Q:  Can I use other medications with Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications (prescription and over-the-counter), supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
