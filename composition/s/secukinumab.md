# Secukinumab
### Generic Name
Secukinumab

### Usage
Secukinumab is a medication primarily used to treat several inflammatory conditions. Its main applications include:

*   **Plaque Psoriasis:**  Secukinumab effectively reduces the inflammation and scaling characteristic of plaque psoriasis, a common skin condition.  It helps clear the skin lesions and improve overall appearance.

*   **Psoriatic Arthritis:** This medication targets the inflammation in joints associated with psoriatic arthritis, reducing pain, swelling, and stiffness. It can also slow the progression of joint damage.

*   **Ankylosing Spondylitis:**  Secukinumab helps manage the inflammation and pain in the spine and sacroiliac joints associated with ankylosing spondylitis, a form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine.

*   **Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis:**  Secukinumab is also used to treat this condition, which shares similarities with ankylosing spondylitis but lacks the characteristic spinal changes seen on X-rays.


### Dosage

Secukinumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection.  Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  It's crucial to follow the healthcare provider's specific instructions.  Here's a general overview:

**Plaque Psoriasis:** A loading dose of 300mg once weekly for five weeks (weeks 0-4), followed by 300mg every four weeks.  Some individuals may only require 150mg per dose.  Each 300mg dose is typically given as two 150mg injections.

**Psoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis:**  Treatment may begin with a loading dose of 150mg once weekly for five weeks (weeks 0-4), followed by 150mg every four weeks.  The dose may be increased to 300mg every four weeks if needed.  If plaque psoriasis is also present, the dosage for plaque psoriasis may be used.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of secukinumab in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Currently, no specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

Secukinumab, like other medications, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity of side effects vary among individuals.  Common side effects include:

*   Infection (upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis)
*   Headache
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Inflammatory bowel disease exacerbation
*   Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*   Candidiasis (fungal infection)
*   Increased risk of other infections


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a protein that plays a significant role in the inflammatory process underlying psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  By blocking IL-17A, secukinumab reduces inflammation and helps alleviate symptoms of these conditions.


### Precautions

*   **Allergies:** Secukinumab is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious allergic reactions to secukinumab or any of its components.

*   **Infections:**  Because secukinumab affects the immune system, there's an increased risk of infections.  Patients with a history of recurring infections or weakened immune systems should be carefully monitored.  Live vaccines should generally be avoided during treatment.

*   **Tuberculosis:**  Patients with latent or active tuberculosis need to be evaluated and treated before starting secukinumab.

*   **Inflammatory Bowel Disease:**  Secukinumab may worsen inflammatory bowel disease.  Those with a history of inflammatory bowel disease should be closely monitored.

*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of secukinumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare provider due to limited data on its effects.

*   **Drug Interactions:** Consult your doctor about other medications you're taking, as some interactions may occur.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results from secukinumab?**  A:  The onset of improvement can vary, but many individuals notice improvements in their symptoms within a few weeks of starting treatment.


*   **Q: How is secukinumab stored?** A: Store secukinumab in a refrigerator.  Do not freeze.


*   **Q: Can I stop taking secukinumab abruptly?** A:  No, it is essential to follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping the medication to prevent potential flare-ups of your condition.  The medication should be gradually discontinued.


*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible to determine the best course of action.


*   **Q: Is secukinumab safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term safety is being monitored, and your doctor will assess the need for continued treatment.
