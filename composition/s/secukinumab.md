# Secukinumab

**Generic Name:** Secukinumab

**Usage:** Secukinumab is a biologic medication used to treat several autoimmune diseases by targeting a specific protein called interleukin-17A (IL-17A).  Its primary uses include:

* **Psoriasis:**  Treating moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults, including those who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
* **Psoriatic Arthritis:** Treating active psoriatic arthritis in adults.
* **Ankylosing Spondylitis:** Treating active ankylosing spondylitis in adults.
* **Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis:** Treating non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) with objective signs of inflammation in adults.
* **Hidradenitis Suppurativa:** Treating moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in adults.
* **Ulcerative Colitis:**  Treating moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) in adults who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, secukinumab can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Infections:** Increased risk of infections (upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, etc.)
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea:**
* **Diarrhea:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site.

**How it Works:** Secukinumab is a monoclonal antibody.  It works by selectively blocking interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a protein involved in the inflammatory process that contributes to the symptoms of the diseases it treats. By inhibiting IL-17A, secukinumab reduces inflammation and improves symptoms.
