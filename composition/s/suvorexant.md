# Suvorexant
### Generic Name
Suvorexant

### Usage
Suvorexant is primarily used to treat insomnia characterized by difficulty falling asleep (sleep onset) and/or staying asleep (sleep maintenance).  It's specifically designed to address the underlying mechanisms of insomnia, rather than just masking the symptoms.  It is not indicated for the treatment of narcolepsy.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The starting dose of Suvorexant is typically 10 mg taken orally, no more than once per night, at least 30 minutes before bedtime, ensuring there are at least 7 hours remaining before the planned wake-up time.  If 10 mg is well-tolerated but ineffective, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 20 mg.  Always use the lowest effective dose.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Suvorexant in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Suvorexant is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.
* **CYP3A Inhibitors:**  If a patient is taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors, the Suvorexant dose should be reduced to 5 mg per night (generally not exceeding 10 mg). Suvorexant is not recommended with strong CYP3A inhibitors.

### How it Works

Suvorexant works by blocking orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the brain. Orexin is a neurotransmitter that promotes wakefulness and arousal. By blocking these receptors, Suvorexant reduces wake drive, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Suvorexant is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and those with narcolepsy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Suvorexant can interact with other medications, particularly those that depress the central nervous system (CNS) such as opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol.  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended.  Using Suvorexant with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of CNS depression.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Suvorexant is classified as Category C in pregnancy. Its use during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so breastfeeding mothers should consider the potential risk to the infant.
* **Specific Populations:** Use caution in patients with compromised respiratory function, depression, or a history of drug dependence.  Obese women may have a greater risk of exposure-related adverse effects.
* **Other Warnings:** Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if drowsiness or dizziness occur.  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking Suvorexant.  This medication may increase the risk of abnormal thinking and behavior, worsening depression, suicidal ideation, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and cataplexy-like syndromes.  Complex sleep behaviors (sleepwalking, sleep-driving, etc.) are also possible.
