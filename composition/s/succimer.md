# Succimer
### Generic Name
Succimer

### Usage
Succimer is primarily used to treat lead poisoning in children with blood lead levels exceeding 45 mcg/dL.  It's a chelating agent, meaning it binds to lead in the body, allowing it to be excreted in the urine.  Importantly,  Succimer is *not* used for preventing lead poisoning; it's a treatment for existing elevated lead levels.  While not officially approved for these uses, Succimer is sometimes used off-label to treat arsenic and mercury poisoning in adults and children.  However, its efficacy and safety in these off-label uses require careful consideration and monitoring under a physician's supervision.

### Dosage

**Lead Poisoning:**

* **Children aged ≥1 year and adolescents:** The usual dose is 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 14 days (total 19 days).  The maximum single dose is 500 mg.  Repeated courses may be necessary, but at least a 2-week interval should be observed between courses. Dosage may also be calculated as 350 mg/m²/dose.

* **Adults (off-label):**  The dosage for adults with lead poisoning varies depending on the severity of the condition and is typically determined by a physician specializing in toxicology. A common regimen involves 10 mg/kg three times daily for five days, followed by 10 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days. The maximum dose remains 500 mg per dose.

* **Arsenic Poisoning (off-label):** A common regimen for adults is 300 mg every 6 hours for 3 days.

* **Mercury Poisoning (off-label):**  Similar to lead poisoning, a typical regimen might be 10 mg/kg three times daily for five days, followed by 10 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days, but this is off-label use and requires careful medical supervision.

**Administration:** Succimer is usually administered orally in capsule form. For those who cannot swallow capsules whole, the contents can be mixed with a small amount of suitable food or liquid like applesauce or juice.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling, however, caution is advised in patients with kidney problems and more frequent monitoring of liver function is recommended in those with liver disease.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥1-10%):**

* Increased serum transaminase levels (liver enzymes)
* Cardiac arrhythmias

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (especially with retreatment), including angioedema and urticaria
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Various other side effects including gastrointestinal issues (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), neurological symptoms (headache, dizziness), skin rashes, and others.

**Note:** If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Succimer is a chelating agent. This means it binds to heavy metals like lead, arsenic, and mercury, forming water-soluble complexes. These complexes are then eliminated from the body through the kidneys in the urine, effectively reducing the heavy metal levels in the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Succimer is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to succimer or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known, but it's essential to inform your doctor about all medications being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Succimer is classified as pregnancy category C. The risks and benefits should be carefully evaluated before use during pregnancy.  The excretion of Succimer in breast milk is unknown, and caution is advised.  Women with elevated lead levels should generally not breastfeed until levels are reduced.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Use caution in patients with kidney or liver disease, with increased monitoring of relevant lab values.
* **Children under 1 year:** Safety and efficacy have not been established.
