# Selenious Acid
### Generic Name
Selenious Acid

### Usage
Selenious acid is primarily used as a source of selenium to treat and prevent selenium deficiency.  This deficiency can arise in various situations, most notably in individuals receiving long-term parenteral nutrition (TPN). TPN, where nutrition is delivered intravenously, can lack sufficient selenium, leading to a deficiency that can manifest in several ways, including impaired immune function, muscle weakness, and neurological problems. Selenious acid is administered to replenish selenium levels and alleviate these deficiency symptoms. While not its primary use, it might play a supportive role in certain conditions where selenium plays a role in the body's processes, but this is often under research and not a standard clinical practice.  Always consult a physician for appropriate use.

### Dosage
Dosage of selenious acid varies significantly depending on the individual's selenium deficiency severity, age, and overall health.  It is crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.  There is no standardized, universally accepted dosage regimen. The dosage is typically determined through blood tests assessing selenium levels, ensuring the supplement is tailored to the individual's needs.  The medication usually comes as an injectable solution for intravenous administration, and the preparation and administration should always be performed by a qualified healthcare professional.  There are no established oral dosage forms, primarily due to selenious acidâ€™s toxicity if ingested in higher amounts.  Pediatric and geriatric dosage adjustments will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician based on the individual's specific needs and blood test results.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of selenious acid are generally mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Garlic breath odor (due to selenium excretion)
* Skin rashes

Less common, but serious side effects may include:

* Hair loss
* Nail changes
* Neurological symptoms (rare but potentially severe)

It's crucial to report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.  High doses of selenious acid can be toxic.

### How it Works
Selenious acid acts as a source of inorganic selenium. Selenium is an essential trace mineral for various bodily functions, including antioxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism, and immune system regulation. When a selenium deficiency exists, selenious acid provides the body with the necessary selenium to restore normal function. The body utilizes the selenium from selenious acid to incorporate it into selenoproteins, crucial enzymes that perform vital tasks within cells.  This replenishment helps alleviate the symptoms associated with selenium deficiency and supports proper physiological processes.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Selenious acid should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to selenium or its compounds.
* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are not extensively documented.  However, it is essential to inform healthcare providers about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies currently being taken to prevent potential unforeseen interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of selenious acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration.  Selenium is essential, but excessive intake can be harmful. A physician should carefully assess the risks and benefits before prescribing it.
* **Elderly and Children:** Dosage adjustments are needed in these populations due to their higher risk of toxicity.  Dosage must be carefully managed under strict medical supervision.
* **Renal or Hepatic Impairment:** Individuals with kidney or liver problems may require a lower dose due to reduced elimination of selenium from the body.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take selenious acid without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Selenious acid is not available over-the-counter and should only be administered under strict medical supervision due to potential toxicity.
* **Q: How is selenious acid stored?** A: Selenious acid should be stored as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and out of reach of children.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Do not attempt to make up for a missed dose.  Contact your doctor for guidance.
* **Q: Are there alternative selenium supplements?** A: Yes, other forms of selenium, such as selenomethionine and sodium selenite, are available, but selenious acid's administration is usually intravenously. The choice of selenium supplementation will depend on the patient's specific needs and medical history.  Only a physician can determine the most appropriate form.
