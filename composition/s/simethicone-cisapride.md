# Simethicone + Cisapride
Please note:  A combination of simethicone and cisapride is **not currently a standard or widely available medication**.  Cisapride was withdrawn from many markets due to serious cardiac side effects.  Therefore, the information below is provided for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.  **Do not attempt to obtain or use this combination without explicit instruction from a qualified medical professional.**


### Generic Name
Simethicone + Cisapride (This combination is not currently marketed)

### Usage

This combination is *theoretically* intended to address symptoms related to gastrointestinal distress.  

* **Simethicone:**  Its primary use is to relieve gas and bloating. It works by altering the surface tension of gas bubbles in the digestive tract, allowing them to coalesce and be more easily passed.

* **Cisapride:**  Before its withdrawal, cisapride was primarily used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and symptoms of slow gastric emptying. It stimulates the movement of food through the digestive tract.


**Because cisapride is no longer widely available due to safety concerns, this combination would not be used in modern medical practice.**  The information below regarding dosage and side effects reflects the properties of each individual drug and should not be taken as guidance for using this combination.

### Dosage

**This section is for informational purposes only and should not be followed.**  Cisapride's use is contraindicated due to serious safety risks.

* **Simethicone:**  Dosage varies widely depending on the formulation (liquid, chewable tablet).  Always follow the instructions on the product label.  Dosing for adults and children is usually based on weight and age, with specific recommendations provided by the manufacturer.

* **Cisapride:**  Dosage for cisapride varied greatly depending on the indication and individual patient factors.  **It is crucial to understand that cisapride is no longer available due to safety concerns and should not be used.**


### Side Effects

* **Simethicone:** Simethicone is generally well-tolerated.  Side effects are rare but may include constipation in some individuals.

* **Cisapride:**  Cisapride carried a significant risk of serious cardiac side effects, including potentially fatal arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), prolonged QT interval, and torsades de pointes (a type of dangerous arrhythmia).  Other side effects included headache, diarrhea, and nausea.  **These serious risks led to its withdrawal from many markets.**


### How it Works

* **Simethicone:** Works mechanically by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing gas to coalesce and be expelled more easily.

* **Cisapride:**  Cisapride acts as a prokinetic agent, meaning it stimulates the motility (movement) of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby facilitating the movement of food through the stomach and intestines. This was thought to alleviate symptoms of GERD and slow gastric emptying.


### Precautions

* **Simethicone:**  Generally considered safe, but those with known allergies to simethicone should avoid it.

* **Cisapride:** **Cisapride is contraindicated and should not be used due to the serious risk of potentially fatal cardiac side effects.**  Particular caution was advised for individuals with certain heart conditions, those taking other medications affecting the heart, and the elderly.


### FAQs

**Q: Is this combination still available?**  A: No, this combination is not currently available or recommended due to the withdrawal of cisapride from the market.
