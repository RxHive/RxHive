**How it Works:** This combination drug works through a synergistic action of its components:

* **Salbutamol:** A beta-2 agonist bronchodilator.  It relaxes the muscles in the airways, opening them up and making breathing easier.  This directly addresses bronchospasm.
* **Etofylline:** A xanthine derivative with bronchodilating and mucolytic properties. It helps relax the airways and may also thin mucus.
* **Bromhexine:** An expectorant. It helps to loosen and thin the mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up.
