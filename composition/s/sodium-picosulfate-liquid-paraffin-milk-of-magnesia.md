# Sodium Picosulfate + Liquid Paraffin + Milk Of Magnesia

**Generic Name:** Sodium Picosulfate + Liquid Paraffin + Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia)

**Usage:** This combination is used for the relief of constipation.  It works by stimulating bowel movements through different mechanisms (see "How it Works" below).  It's typically used for short-term relief and not intended for long-term use.  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**  While generally considered safe when used as directed, side effects can occur. These may include:

* **Abdominal cramps or discomfort:** This is relatively common, especially with higher doses.
* **Diarrhea:** This can be a sign of overdose or sensitivity.
* **Nausea:** Less common but can occur.
* **Dehydration:**  Due to increased bowel movements, especially if diarrhea occurs.  Important to drink plenty of fluids.
* **Electrolyte imbalance:** (particularly with long-term use or high doses of magnesium hydroxide)  This is more of a concern with chronic use.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.  Stop use and seek medical attention if you experience symptoms such as rash, itching, or difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** This combination uses a three-pronged approach to relieve constipation:

* **Sodium Picosulfate:** A stimulant laxative. It works by increasing fluid and electrolyte secretion into the bowel, stimulating bowel movements.
* **Liquid Paraffin:** A stool softener (emollient laxative). It lubricates the stool, making it softer and easier to pass.
* **Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia):** A saline laxative. It draws water into the intestines, increasing stool bulk and stimulating bowel movements.
