# Sorbitol
### Generic Name
Sorbitol

### Usage
Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol with multiple medical applications.  Its primary use is as a hyperosmotic laxative, meaning it draws water into the intestines, softening stool and promoting bowel movements. This makes it useful for treating constipation.  Sorbitol is also used as a genitourinary irrigant during transurethral procedures like prostate surgery, where it helps to maintain clear vision during the operation.  Additionally, it acts as a humectant (retaining moisture), and is sometimes used to facilitate the passage of certain medications through the intestinal tract.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the intended use and the patient's age.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hyperosmotic Laxative (oral):** 30-45 mL of a 70% solution, infrequently as a single dose.
* **Hyperosmotic Laxative (rectal enema):** 120 mL of a 25-30% solution.
* **Transurethral Surgical Procedures (topical irrigation):** 3-3.3% solution.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is significantly lower and depends heavily on age and weight.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for appropriate pediatric dosing. Specific examples include:

* **Constipation (oral, children â‰¥12 years):** 30-45 mL of a 70% solution as needed, with a maximum single dose of 60 mL.  Higher daily doses may be necessary, but this must be determined by a doctor.
* **Constipation (rectal enema, children 2-11 years):** 30-60 mL of a 25-30% solution as needed.
* **Toxic ingestion (adjunct with charcoal, all ages):**  4.3 mL/kg of a 35% solution, usually administered once with the initial charcoal dose.  This is a specialized use and requires medical supervision.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild but can include:

* Abdominal distress
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

Less common but more serious side effects can occur, especially with high doses or prolonged use:

* Edema (swelling)
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Hypovolemia (low blood volume)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Lactic acidosis (a dangerous buildup of lactic acid)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Sorbitol acts as an osmotic laxative.  When ingested or administered rectally, it draws water into the intestines from the surrounding tissues. This increase in water content softens the stool, making it easier to pass.  During surgical procedures, this osmotic effect helps to keep the surgical field clear.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Sorbitol is contraindicated in cases of anuria (absence of urine production) when used for irrigation.  It should not be used for longer than 7 days for constipation relief unless under medical supervision.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Sorbitol may affect the absorption or effectiveness of certain medications.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Specifically, it may decrease the levels of lamivudine and increase the effects of calcium or sodium polystyrene sulfonate.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Patients with kidney or liver problems may need to have their dosage adjusted.  Consult with a doctor before using sorbitol if you have impaired organ function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Sorbitol is classified as Pregnancy Category C. It's crucial to discuss the use of sorbitol with your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  The excretion of sorbitol in breast milk is unknown, so caution is warranted.
* **Children and Infants:** Use sorbitol cautiously in children and infants, as their dosage should be carefully adjusted based on their age and weight by a medical professional.  Infants are particularly vulnerable.
* **Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance:** High doses or prolonged use of sorbitol can potentially lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.  Medical supervision is particularly important in these situations.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for sorbitol to work as a laxative?**
A: The onset of action as a laxative is typically within 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the dose and individual factors.
