# Sorbitol

**Generic Name:** Sorbitol

**Usage:**

Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol used in a variety of applications, primarily as a:

* **Sweetener:** It's used as a sugar substitute in many foods and beverages, including candies, chewing gum, and diet products.  It provides about half the calories of sugar.
* **Humectant:** It retains moisture, helping to prevent foods from drying out and becoming hard.  This is useful in baked goods, confectionery, and other food products.
* **Laxative:**  In higher doses, sorbitol acts as an osmotic laxative, drawing water into the intestines and promoting bowel movements.  It's often used to treat constipation.
* **Pharmaceutical excipient:** It's used as a filler, binder, and sweetener in various medications.
* **Dental products:** It can be found in some toothpastes and mouthwashes.


**Side Effects:**

The side effects of sorbitol depend heavily on the dose.  Small amounts are generally well-tolerated. However, larger amounts, particularly as a laxative, can cause:

* **Gastrointestinal distress:** This is the most common side effect and includes gas, bloating, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea.  The severity is dose-dependent.
* **Headache:**  Less common, but possible.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** In rare cases, particularly in individuals with diabetes or those on certain medications.


**How it Works:**

* **Sweetener:** Sorbitol binds to sweet taste receptors on the tongue, providing a sweet taste.
* **Humectant:**  Sorbitol's high water-holding capacity allows it to attract and bind water molecules, preventing dryness.
* **Laxative:**  Sorbitol is poorly absorbed in the small intestine.  It draws water into the colon through osmosis, increasing stool bulk and stimulating bowel movements.


**FAQs:**

* **Is sorbitol safe?**  In moderate amounts, sorbitol is generally considered safe for most people. However, excessive consumption can lead to gastrointestinal upset.
* **Is sorbitol keto-friendly?** No, sorbitol contains carbohydrates and can impact blood sugar levels, making it unsuitable for a strict ketogenic diet.
* **Can I use sorbitol as a laxative every day?** No, regular use of sorbitol as a laxative is not recommended.  Chronic use can lead to dependency and electrolyte imbalances. Consult a doctor before using sorbitol as a laxative regularly.
* **Does sorbitol cause tooth decay?** While it's less cariogenic (cavity-causing) than sucrose, it can still contribute to tooth decay if consumed in excess.  Good oral hygiene is still important.
* **What's the difference between sorbitol and xylitol?** Both are sugar alcohols, but xylitol is sweeter and has different properties, including potential toxicity to dogs.  Sorbitol is generally considered less toxic to pets but should still be given with caution.
