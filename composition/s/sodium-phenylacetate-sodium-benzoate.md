# Sodium Phenylacetate + Sodium Benzoate
### Generic Name
Sodium Phenylacetate + Sodium Benzoate

### Usage
Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate is used as an adjunct therapy for acute hyperammonemia and associated encephalopathy in patients with urea cycle enzyme deficiencies.  This combination medication helps remove excess ammonia from the body, a crucial function when the body's natural ammonia-removal processes are impaired.  It's not a standalone treatment but works in conjunction with other supportive measures.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For acute hyperammonemia related to urea cycle disorders, the intravenous (IV) loading dose is 55 mL/m² (providing 5.5 g/m² of each sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate). This is co-administered with arginine.  The loading dose is infused over 90-120 minutes. A maintenance infusion of an equivalent dose is then given over 24 hours.  Repeat loading doses are generally avoided due to the risk of neurotoxicity from high phenylacetate levels.  In severe cases or those unresponsive to the medication, hemodialysis might be considered. Treatment continues until ammonia levels normalize or the patient tolerates oral nutrition and medication. Antiemetics may be given to manage infusion-related nausea and vomiting.

**Children:** Dosage depends on weight and age.
    * Infants and children weighing ≤20 kg: Loading dose of 2.5 mL/kg (providing 250 mg/kg of each component), followed by a maintenance infusion of 2.5 mL/kg per 24 hours.
    * Children and adolescents weighing >20 kg:  Loading dose of 55 mL/m² (providing 5.5 g/m² of each component), followed by a maintenance infusion of 55 mL/m² per 24 hours.
The loading dose is administered over 90-120 minutes, and the maintenance dose is given over 24 hours.  Arginine is given concurrently, with the dose varying based on the specific urea cycle disorder.  Treatment is initiated as soon as hyperammonemia is diagnosed and continues until ammonia levels are normal or the patient can tolerate oral nutrition and medication.  Antiemetics may be necessary.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However, caution is advised in these cases, with close monitoring due to the role of the liver and kidneys in metabolizing and excreting the medication and its metabolites. Dialysis may be necessary, particularly hemodialysis, as it's significantly more effective at ammonia clearance than peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Nausea and vomiting are commonly reported.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** The following are possible, though less frequent:

* Cardiovascular problems: Hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac failure, etc.
* Neurological issues: Seizures, confusion, decreased mental acuity, coma.
* Skin reactions: Rash, itching, alopecia.
* Metabolic disturbances:  Acidosis, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia.
* Gastrointestinal issues: Diarrhea, abdominal distention.
* Hepatic: Hepatotoxicity, jaundice, hepatic failure.
* Renal: Renal failure.
* Infection: Sepsis.
* Multi-organ failure.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If any adverse effects occur,  it's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate work by providing alternative pathways for the body to eliminate ammonia.  They do this by binding to ammonia, converting it into metabolites (hippurate and phenylacetylglutamine) that are then excreted in the urine.  This reduces the levels of toxic ammonia in the blood, protecting the brain and other organs. One mole of sodium phenylacetate removes two moles of nitrogen, while one mole of sodium benzoate removes one mole.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Interactions:** Probenecid may increase sodium phenylacetate serum levels.
* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of extravasation (leakage from the IV line), fluid overload, gastrointestinal effects, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperventilation, and neurotoxicity.  Use caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  The medication can be detected in umbilical cord blood and breast milk.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** This combination is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. It's found in umbilical cord blood and breast milk, so the risks and benefits of breastfeeding during therapy should be carefully considered.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is this medication administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) via a central line, not a peripheral line, to avoid burning.
* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: Treatment duration varies depending on the patient's response and ammonia levels. It continues until ammonia levels are normal, or the patient can tolerate oral nutrition and medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you notice any unusual or concerning symptoms.
* **Q: Can I take this medication with other drugs?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you're taking, as interactions are possible.
* **Q: How should this medication be stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label.
* **Q: Is this medication appropriate for all ages?** A: It's used in both adults and children, but dosage is adjusted based on age, weight, and body surface area.
