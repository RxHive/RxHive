# Sodium Lactate
### Generic Name
Sodium Lactate

### Usage
Sodium lactate is primarily used as an alkalinizing agent to treat and prevent mild to moderate metabolic acidosis.  Metabolic acidosis is a condition where there's too much acid in the body's fluids.  Sodium lactate works by providing a source of bicarbonate, which helps neutralize the excess acid and restore the body's acid-base balance.  It's important to note that sodium lactate is not used to treat severe or lactic acidosis.

### Dosage
Dosage of sodium lactate is highly individualized and depends on the severity of the acidosis.  There are no standard dosages listed for children as safety and efficacy haven't been established in this population. For adults, the dosage is determined by the physician based on the individual's blood tests showing the level of acidosis.  The medication is usually administered intravenously (IV) after being diluted appropriately.  The specific dilution and administration rate will be determined by a healthcare professional.  There are no specific dosage adjustments provided for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects associated with sodium lactate administration, though frequency isn't precisely defined, include:

* Febrile response (fever)
* Injection site infections
* Phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)
* Extravasation (leakage of fluid from a blood vessel)
* Hypervolemia (excess fluid in the blood)

While rare, more serious side effects can occur.  It is vital to seek immediate medical attention if any adverse effects develop.

### How it Works
Sodium lactate acts as a bicarbonate precursor. Once administered, the lactate ion in sodium lactate is metabolized in the liver, ultimately generating bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).  Bicarbonate is an important buffer in the body's blood, helping to neutralize excess acids and maintain the proper pH balance.  By increasing bicarbonate levels, sodium lactate helps correct metabolic acidosis.

### Precautions
Sodium lactate is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood)
* Fluid retention
* Lactic acidosis (a specific type of acidosis where lactate builds up)


Use with caution is advised in patients with:

* Severe renal impairment (kidney problems)
* Edema (swelling) with sodium retention
* Those receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin (hormone medication)


Sodium lactate should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding as its excretion in breast milk isn't known. It falls under pregnancy category C, meaning the potential risks to a fetus haven't been fully established.


Several drug interactions are possible. Sodium lactate can affect the serum concentrations of certain medications, including but not limited to: alpha-/beta-agonists (indirect-acting), amphetamines, flecainide, mecamylamine, memantine, and quinine.  It's critical to inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is sodium lactate administered?**  A: Typically intravenously (IV) after dilution.  Never administer without a healthcare professional's guidance.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication and immediately contact your doctor or seek medical attention.

* **Q: Can I store sodium lactate at home?** A: No, sodium lactate for intravenous use is typically stored and handled by healthcare facilities.

* **Q: Is sodium lactate suitable for everyone?** A: No, it's contraindicated in certain conditions (see precautions) and its use should always be determined by a healthcare professional.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Since Sodium Lactate is usually administered by a healthcare professional in a clinical setting, this question is not relevant. Contact your physician if you have any questions about your treatment plan.
