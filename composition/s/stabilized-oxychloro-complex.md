# Stabilized Oxychloro Complex
### Generic Name
Stabilized Oxychloro Complex

### Usage
Stabilized Oxychloro Complex is primarily used as a preservative in topical ophthalmic medications, such as artificial tears and antiglaucoma eye drops.  It's not a medication to treat a specific disease itself; rather, it prevents the growth of microorganisms in the eye drops, ensuring their sterility and safety for use.  Its role is purely as a preservative to maintain the product's efficacy and prevent contamination.

### Dosage
There is no dosage for Stabilized Oxychloro Complex as it's not a drug taken by the patient. The concentration in ophthalmic solutions is determined by the manufacturer and is usually present at a low concentration to effectively preserve the formulation without causing irritation to the eye.  The amount of the complex in a given eye drop product will be specified on the product labeling.  This information should be consulted before using any eye drops containing this preservative.

### Side Effects
Because Stabilized Oxychloro Complex is a preservative and not a drug administered directly, it is not typically listed separately as causing side effects. However, some individuals may experience mild eye irritation or discomfort from the eye drop formulation itself, even if the preservative is well-tolerated. If significant eye irritation, redness, or other adverse effects occur after using an ophthalmic product containing this preservative, discontinue use and contact your eye care professional immediately.

### How it Works
Stabilized Oxychloro Complex works by releasing chlorine-free radicals when exposed to light. These radicals disrupt microbial protein synthesis through oxidation of glutathione, a crucial molecule within microbial cells.  This process leads to cell death, thereby preventing the growth of microorganisms that could contaminate the eye drop solution. The complex's mixture of chlorine dioxide, chlorite, and chlorate contributes to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.

### Precautions
* **Sensitivity:** Although generally well-tolerated, some individuals may be sensitive to components of the complex.  If you experience any unusual reaction after using an eye drop containing Stabilized Oxychloro Complex, stop using the product and consult your doctor or ophthalmologist.
* **Contact Lenses:** Itâ€™s crucial to check the specific instructions on your eye drop bottle. Some products containing this preservative may not be compatible with contact lenses. Remove contact lenses before using such eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There's limited data on the effects of this preservative during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor or ophthalmologist if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant before using eye drops containing Stabilized Oxychloro Complex.
* **Other Medications:** This preservative is not known to interact significantly with other medications, but always inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are using.
* **Storage:**  Follow the storage instructions on the eye drop packaging to maintain the product's effectiveness and safety.  Improper storage might affect the complex's stability and antimicrobial properties.
