# Salmeterol
### Generic Name
Salmeterol

### Usage
Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) primarily used for the maintenance treatment and prevention of asthma symptoms in patients aged 4 years and older.  It's also used to maintain treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.  Crucially, salmeterol is *not* for the relief of acute bronchospasm; it's a preventative medication, not a rescue inhaler.  In asthma management, it's essential to use salmeterol in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid, not as monotherapy.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Asthma/Bronchospasm (Prevention & Maintenance):**  The usual dose is one inhalation (50 mcg) from a dry powder inhaler or two inhalations (25 mcg/inhalation) from a metered-dose inhaler, twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.  Do not exceed twice-daily administration.
* **COPD (Maintenance):** The dosage is the same as for asthma prevention and maintenance.
* **Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm (Prevention):** One inhalation (50 mcg) from a dry powder inhaler 30 minutes before exercise. A second dose should not be given within 12 hours. This dosage is not for patients already on twice-daily salmeterol therapy.


**Children (4 years and older):**

* **Asthma (Prevention & Maintenance):**  One inhalation (50 mcg) from a dry powder inhaler or two inhalations (25 mcg/inhalation) from a metered-dose inhaler, twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart. Do not exceed twice-daily administration. For long-term asthma control, it's crucial to use LABAs like salmeterol *in combination* with inhaled corticosteroids.  Monotherapy is not recommended.
* **Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm (Prevention):** One inhalation (50 mcg) from a dry powder inhaler twice daily.  Do not exceed twice-daily administration.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However,  given that salmeterol is primarily cleared by the liver,  caution is advised in patients with liver disease, with close monitoring of their response.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Pain
*  Hypertension
* Edema
* Dizziness
* Sleep disorders
* Anxiety
* Skin rash
*  Increased liver enzyme levels
*  Nasal congestion
* Cough
* Throat irritation


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
*  Cardiac arrhythmias
*  Increased intraocular pressure (potentially leading to glaucoma)


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Salmeterol works by binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs.  This binding triggers a chain of events that lead to relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscles, widening the airways and improving airflow. Its long-acting nature allows for sustained bronchodilation, providing long-term control of asthma and COPD symptoms. The long lipophilic side chain allows the active portion to remain at the receptor site for prolonged periods.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Salmeterol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to salmeterol or any component of the formulation; those experiencing status asthmaticus or acute episodes of asthma or COPD; those using it as monotherapy for asthma (without a concomitant inhaled corticosteroid); those with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins; and patients with tachyarrhythmias.
* **Interactions:** Salmeterol may interact with beta-blockers, other long-acting beta-2 agonists, cannabinoids, certain CYP3A4 inhibitors, loop diuretics, MAO inhibitors, QTc-prolonging agents, sympatholytics, sympathomimetics, thiazide diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, and certain HIV protease inhibitors. Consult your doctor about potential interactions with other medications.
* **Warnings:** Long-term use of LABAs as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) increases the risk of asthma-related death. Salmeterol should only be used as add-on therapy for inadequately controlled asthma patients already using an inhaled corticosteroid.  It should not be initiated in patients whose asthma is well-controlled on low- to medium-dose corticosteroids.  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver impairment, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, or seizure disorders.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Salmeterol for immediate relief of asthma symptoms?** A: No, Salmeterol is a preventative medication, not a rescue inhaler. Use a short-acting beta-2 agonist inhaler for quick relief.
* **Q: How should I store Salmeterol?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I take Salmeterol with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements. Some medications may interact with Salmeterol.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is Salmeterol safe for children?** A:  Salmeterol is approved for use in children aged 4 years and older, but always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any adverse effects.
