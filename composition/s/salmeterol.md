# Salmeterol

**Generic Name:** Salmeterol

**Usage:**

Salmeterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) bronchodilator used to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's typically used *in conjunction with* other medications, not as a standalone treatment for acute symptoms.  It is *not* intended for quick relief of asthma symptoms; for that, a short-acting beta2-agonist (like albuterol) is necessary.  Salmeterol is usually administered via an inhaler (metered-dose inhaler or dry powder inhaler) twice daily, at approximately 12-hour intervals.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Tremor (shaking)
* Headache
* Muscle cramps
* Nervousness
* Dizziness
* Fast heartbeat
* Sore throat
* Cough
* Oral thrush (fungal infection in the mouth)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Increased blood pressure
* Seizures
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood)


**How it Works:**

Salmeterol works by relaxing and opening the airways in the lungs. It does this by binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscles of the airways.  This binding triggers a series of cellular events that ultimately lead to relaxation of the muscles, widening the airways and improving airflow.  The long-acting nature of salmeterol allows for prolonged bronchodilation, providing preventative benefits rather than immediate relief.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use salmeterol for sudden asthma attacks?** A: No. Salmeterol is a preventative medication and is not for immediate relief of asthma symptoms. Use a quick-relief inhaler (like albuterol) for acute symptoms.

* **Q: Can I stop taking salmeterol suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping salmeterol suddenly can worsen your condition.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and discontinuation.

* **Q:  Is salmeterol safe for children?** A: Salmeterol can be used in children, but only under the strict supervision and prescription of a doctor.  The dosage and appropriateness will be determined based on the child's age and condition.

* **Q:  Can salmeterol cause weight gain?** A: While not a common side effect, some individuals may experience slight weight gain.

* **Q:  Can I use salmeterol during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Consult your doctor immediately. The risks and benefits of using salmeterol during pregnancy or breastfeeding need careful consideration.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never take a double dose.
