# Sulphacetamide + Neomycin + Bacitracin
### Generic Name
Sulphacetamide + Neomycin + Bacitracin

### Usage
Sulphacetamide + Neomycin + Bacitracin is a triple antibiotic ophthalmic ointment used primarily to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye).  This combination medication effectively targets a broad spectrum of bacteria commonly responsible for eye infections. While its primary use is in treating bacterial conjunctivitis, it may also be used for other bacterial infections of the eye's surface, as directed by a physician. It's crucial to understand that this ointment is *not* effective against viral or fungal eye infections.  A proper diagnosis from a healthcare professional is essential before using this medication.

### Dosage
Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation and the physician's recommendation.  Generally, a small amount (about a 1/2-inch ribbon) of the ointment is applied to the affected eye(s) typically two to four times daily.  For children, the dosage should always be determined by a pediatrician.  This medication is for topical ophthalmic use only; it should *never* be ingested or used for any other purpose than treating eye infections.  There is no IV form of this medication.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Mild burning or stinging sensation upon application.
* Temporary blurred vision.
* Mild redness or irritation.
* Eyelid swelling.

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* Severe eye irritation or pain.
* Changes in vision.
* Secondary infection.

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
This combination medication contains three different antibiotics that work synergistically to combat bacterial infections:

* **Sulphacetamide:** A sulphonamide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with folic acid synthesis, a vital process for bacterial survival.
* **Neomycin:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that disrupts bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Bacitracin:** A polypeptide antibiotic that interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing bacterial replication and causing bacterial cell lysis.

By combining these three antibiotics, the ointment offers broad-spectrum coverage against a wide range of bacteria, increasing the likelihood of successful treatment.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Do not use this medication if you have a known allergy to sulphacetamide, neomycin, bacitracin, or any other components of the ointment.
* **Contact lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying the ointment and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Other medications:** Inform your doctor about all other medications you are currently taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, to avoid potential drug interactions.
* **Prolonged use:**  Extended use can lead to the growth of resistant bacteria.  It's crucial to complete the prescribed course of treatment, but if symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical advice.
* **Children:**  Use only as directed by a pediatrician.
