**Generic Name:** Sulfacetamide Sodium + Neomycin Sulfate + Bacitracin Zinc

It's usually prescribed for mild to moderate infections.  **Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice. Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this ointment can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation upon application
* Temporary blurred vision
* Mild eye irritation
* Allergic reactions (rare but possible; may manifest as itching, swelling, or increased redness)

More serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a doctor immediately.  These could include:

* Severe eye pain
* Vision changes
* Increased redness or swelling of the eye
* Signs of a severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)

**How it Works:** This triple antibiotic ointment works by targeting bacterial infections in the eye.

* **Sulfacetamide Sodium:** A sulfonamide antibiotic that works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to produce folic acid, a necessary component for their growth and survival.
* **Neomycin Sulfate:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial replication.
* **Bacitracin Zinc:** A polypeptide antibiotic that disrupts bacterial cell wall formation, leading to cell death.


By combining these three antibiotics, the ointment provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria.  This approach also reduces the risk of bacteria developing resistance to individual antibiotics.
