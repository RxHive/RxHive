# Sunitinib
### Generic Name
Sunitinib

### Usage

Sunitinib is a targeted cancer medication primarily used to treat several types of advanced cancers.  Its main applications are:

* **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):**  Sunitinib is used to treat both advanced (metastatic) and adjuvant RCC.  Adjuvant treatment means it's used after surgery to help prevent the cancer from returning.  For advanced RCC, it's used when other treatments haven't worked or are no longer effective.

* **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST):** Sunitinib is a valuable treatment option for GISTs that have progressed after or are not suitable for other therapies like imatinib.

* **Progressive, Well-differentiated Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors:** This medication is employed for treating these tumors when they've progressed despite other treatment strategies.

While the above are the primary uses, sunitinib is sometimes used off-label (meaning it's not officially approved for this purpose but may be considered by a doctor) for other cancers such as certain types of soft tissue sarcomas (excluding GIST) and refractory thyroid cancer.  The effectiveness and safety in these off-label uses vary and should be discussed extensively with an oncologist.

### Dosage

Sunitinib dosage varies considerably depending on the specific cancer being treated and the patient's overall health. It's crucial to follow the prescribed regimen precisely as instructed by your physician.  The medication comes in oral capsules.

**Adult Dosage (Examples):**  Dosage schedules often involve cycles of treatment ("on" and "off" periods). This is not an exhaustive list and dosages should always be determined by a physician.

* **RCC (Advanced):** A common regimen involves 50 mg once daily for four weeks, followed by a two-week break, and this cycle is repeated until disease progression or unacceptable side effects. Another regimen involves 50mg daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1 week break.

* **RCC (Adjuvant):**  Typically involves 50 mg once daily for four weeks, followed by a two-week break, repeating the cycle for a total of nine cycles.

* **GIST:**  One approach is 50 mg once daily for four weeks followed by a two-week break; another common (off-label) approach is 37.5 mg daily continuously.

* **Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors:**  Usually 37.5 mg once daily continuously until the disease progresses or side effects become intolerable.  A maximum dose of 50mg daily may be used.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of sunitinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage may need to be adjusted or the medication may need to be temporarily stopped based on factors such as kidney or liver function, or the severity of side effects.  Your healthcare provider will closely monitor your condition and make adjustments as needed.

### How it Works

Sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  Tyrosine kinases are enzymes involved in cell growth and the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  Cancer cells often rely on these enzymes to grow and spread. Sunitinib works by blocking the activity of several types of tyrosine kinases, including those vital to the growth of certain cancer cells and their ability to create new blood vessels to nourish themselves.  By inhibiting these kinases, sunitinib helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells and limit their blood supply.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Sunitinib should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to sunitinib or its components, or women who are pregnant.

* **Drug Interactions:** Sunitinib can interact with many other medications.  It's essential to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to minimize potential risks.  Some interactions may necessitate dosage adjustments or avoidance of certain combinations.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sunitinib is categorized as a pregnancy category D drug, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during treatment and for a period after treatment ends.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking sunitinib.

* **Other Precautions:** Patients with pre-existing kidney or liver conditions require careful monitoring.  Regular blood tests and check-ups are necessary to monitor organ function and identify potential problems early.  Patients should report any unusual bleeding or bruising.
