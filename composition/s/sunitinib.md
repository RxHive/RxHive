**How it Works:**

Sunitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Sunitinib works by blocking the activity of several tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor), and c-KIT. By inhibiting these receptors, sunitinib disrupts the formation of new blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, and it also interferes with the growth and survival of cancer cells.


**FAQs:**

* **How is sunitinib administered?**  Sunitinib is usually taken orally as a capsule.
* **How long is the treatment course?**  The length of treatment varies depending on the type and stage of cancer and the patient's response to the drug.  Treatment cycles often involve periods of taking the medication followed by periods of rest.
* **What are the precautions I should take while on sunitinib?**  You should inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, as sunitinib can interact with other drugs.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure, liver and kidney function is typically required.  You should avoid pregnancy and breastfeeding while on this medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not double the dose.
* **Are there long-term effects?** Some long-term effects are possible, and regular monitoring is crucial to detect and manage potential complications.
