# Sterile Water for Injection
### Generic Name
Sterile Water for Injection

### Usage
Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI) is not a medication in itself; it's a sterile, non-pyrogenic (free from fever-causing substances) distilled water. Its primary use is as a solvent or diluent for reconstituting or diluting other medications that are administered intravenously (IV).  It's used to prepare injectable solutions by adding other drugs to create a solution suitable for injection.  In some cases, after the addition of suitable additives to make it isotonic (having the same osmotic pressure as body fluids), it may be used as a fluid replacement, although this is less common.

### Dosage
The dosage of SWFI is entirely dependent on the medication being added. There's no standard dosage for SWFI alone because it's always used with another drug. The amount of SWFI used will be specified in the instructions for the drug being reconstituted or diluted.  The dosage instructions for the added medication will specify how much SWFI to add to achieve the correct concentration. This will vary depending on factors such as the patient's age, weight, medical condition, and the specific requirements of the added medication.  The dosage will also depend on whether the SWFI is being used to dilute or reconstitute the medication – in reconstitution, the instructions will be precise and will not allow for flexibility in the amount of SWFI used.


### Side Effects
SWFI itself rarely causes direct side effects.  However, problems can arise if it's administered incorrectly or if the medication added to the SWFI causes adverse reactions. Possible side effects may include:

*   Febrile response (fever)
*   Infection at the injection site
*   Venous thrombosis or phlebitis (blood clots or inflammation in a vein)
*   Extravasation (leakage of fluid from a blood vessel into surrounding tissues)
*   Hypervolemia (excess fluid in the blood)
*   Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), particularly if administered without additives
*   Hemoglobin-induced renal failure (kidney failure caused by hemoglobin in the urine)


Any adverse reaction should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
SWFI doesn't have a therapeutic action on its own.  Its role is purely to act as a vehicle or solvent. It dissolves and carries the active pharmaceutical ingredient of another drug, allowing it to be easily administered intravenously.  Once the added medication is dissolved in the SWFI, the medication works according to its own mechanism of action.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindication:** SWFI should never be administered intravenously without adding other medications to make it isotonic.  Giving SWFI alone intravenously can lead to hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) and potentially, hemoglobin-induced renal failure.
*   **Additives:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions precisely when adding other medications or additives to SWFI.  Improper mixing can lead to adverse reactions.
*   **Visual Inspection:** Always inspect the container of SWFI for particulate matter or discoloration before administration. If any are observed, the solution should be discarded.
*   **Aseptic Technique:** Use strict aseptic techniques during the preparation and administration of any solution made with SWFI to minimize the risk of infection.
*   **Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer’s labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. For patients with renal (kidney) impairment, the risk of hemolysis and subsequent renal failure is increased.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I use Sterile Water for Injection for anything other than reconstituting medications?** A: While SWFI can be used as a diluent in some instances, it should never be injected alone intravenously. It must be used only to reconstitute or dilute other medicines.
*   **Q: How should I store Sterile Water for Injection?** A:  Store SWFI according to the manufacturer's instructions usually at room temperature.  Once a container is opened, any unused portion must be discarded.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience an adverse reaction after receiving a medication diluted with Sterile Water for Injection?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Report all symptoms to your doctor or other healthcare provider.
*   **Q: Is Sterile Water for Injection safe for children?** A: SWFI itself is not inherently unsafe for children, however it is crucial to be guided by proper medical and dosage instructions relating to the medications it carries.  The volume of fluid administered must be carefully monitored in infants and small children.
