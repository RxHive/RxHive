# Sumatriptan + Naproxen

**Generic Name:** Sumatriptan/Naproxen

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat migraine headaches with or without aura.  It combines a triptan (sumatriptan) and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID, naproxen).  Sumatriptan narrows blood vessels around the brain and naproxen reduces inflammation and pain.  It's intended for acute treatment of a migraine attack, *not* for prevention.  It is usually taken at the first sign of a migraine.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity.  Common side effects include:

* **From Sumatriptan:**  Dizziness, drowsiness, tingling or numbness, weakness, warmth, pressure sensation, flushing, chest tightness or pressure (rare but serious, seek immediate medical attention if this occurs), fatigue.  More rarely:  high blood pressure, heart palpitations, seizures.
* **From Naproxen:**  Stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness.  More rarely:  allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), kidney problems, liver problems, increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use).

**How it Works:**

* **Sumatriptan:**  Sumatriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain and reducing the release of substances that cause pain and inflammation associated with migraines.
* **Naproxen:** Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.  The combined action of sumatriptan and naproxen provides a more comprehensive approach to migraine relief.
