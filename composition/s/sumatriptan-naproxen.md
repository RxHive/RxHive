# Sumatriptan + Naproxen
### Generic Name
Sumatriptan + Naproxen

### Usage

Sumatriptan and Naproxen combination is used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches (with or without aura) in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  It's a combination therapy leveraging the strengths of two different drug mechanisms. Sumatriptan, a triptan, works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain and reducing the release of pain-causing substances. Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces inflammation and provides pain relief.  This combination is not for preventing migraines (prophylactic use) or treating cluster headaches.  While sometimes used off-label for menstrual migraines, this isn't a formally approved indication.

### Dosage

**Adults (Migraine):** The usual starting dose is one tablet (containing Sumatriptan and Naproxen;  specific strengths vary by product – check your prescription). This dose can be repeated once after two hours if needed. The maximum daily dose is two tablets within 24 hours.  It's crucial to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.

**Adults (Menstrual Migraine - Off-Label):** One tablet within one hour of migraine onset.  A second dose may be taken after two hours if needed, but no more than two tablets in 24 hours.

**Children (Migraine - 12-17 years):** Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation available (different strengths of Sumatriptan and Naproxen exist). Always follow your doctor's specific instructions. Generally, the initial dose is one tablet at the onset of pain. The maximum daily dose is usually limited to one tablet (again, confirm with your doctor and prescription details).

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.  Individuals with mild to moderate liver impairment may require a lower dose. Those with severe liver or kidney impairment should not use this medication.  Always consult your doctor before taking this medicine if you have any liver or kidney issues.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Sumatriptan targets specific serotonin receptors (5-HT1B/1D) in the brain.  Activating these receptors causes blood vessels in the brain to constrict, reducing the pain associated with migraine.  Naproxen, an NSAID, reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to inflammation and pain signaling.  The combination of these actions provides broader pain relief.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Sumatriptan, Naproxen, or any of its components; history of coronary artery disease, stroke, or transient ischemic attack; uncontrolled hypertension; peripheral vascular disease; active gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding; severe liver or kidney impairment; use of MAO inhibitors (within 2 weeks); and third-trimester pregnancy.  It's also contraindicated in individuals who have experienced allergic reactions (like asthma or urticaria) to aspirin or other NSAIDs.

**Interactions:** This medication may interact with several drugs, including those affecting blood clotting (e.g., warfarin, aspirin), ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, digoxin, lithium, and methotrexate.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.


**Specific Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma, heart failure, a history of seizures, and the elderly. Avoid operating heavy machinery or driving if drowsiness occurs.  Pregnant women should avoid this medicine in the third trimester, and its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered with your physician's advice.
