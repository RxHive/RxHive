# Sodium Cromoglycate + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate

**Generic Name:** Sodium Cromoglycate + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate

**Usage:** This combination is not a standard, pre-approved pharmaceutical combination.  Sodium cromoglycate and zinc sulphate monohydrate are used separately, and sometimes *in conjunction by a doctor*, for treating specific conditions.  They are *not* typically combined into a single formulation.

* **Sodium Cromoglycate:** Primarily used to prevent allergic reactions, specifically in conditions like asthma, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and conjunctivitis. It works by stabilizing mast cells, preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators.

* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Used in a variety of ways, including as a supplement to treat zinc deficiency, and topically to treat certain skin conditions like acne. It may also have some antimicrobial properties.


**Side Effects:**

* **Sodium Cromoglycate:**  Generally well-tolerated. Side effects are usually mild and may include a slightly bitter taste (with inhaled forms), cough, throat irritation (with inhaled forms), and rarely, nausea or vomiting.

* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and headache.  High doses can lead to more serious issues like copper deficiency.  Topical application may cause skin irritation.

**How it Works:**

* **Sodium Cromoglycate:**  Prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells, thus reducing allergic symptoms. It doesn't treat an ongoing allergic reaction, but rather prevents the reaction from occurring in the first place.

* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** The mechanism of action varies depending on the use. As a supplement, it provides zinc for bodily functions. Topically, it may have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.  The exact mechanism for some of its topical actions is not fully understood.

**FAQs:**

* **Is this combination commonly prescribed?** No.  While a doctor might prescribe both sodium cromoglycate and zinc sulphate separately for a patient, they are not typically combined in a single medication.  This should only be done under strict medical supervision.

* **What are the potential risks of combining them?** The risks are primarily related to potential side effects of both drugs individually and any potential interactions that haven't been extensively studied.  Combining them without medical advice is strongly discouraged.

* **Where can I get this combination?** You cannot readily obtain a pre-made combination of sodium cromoglycate and zinc sulphate monohydrate. Both ingredients are available separately through pharmacies, but only with a doctor's prescription or over-the-counter, depending on the form and intended use.

* **Should I combine these medications myself?** No.  Never combine medications without explicit instructions from a doctor or pharmacist.  This could lead to dangerous side effects or ineffective treatment.  If you are considering using both medications, consult a medical professional to assess your individual needs and determine the appropriate course of treatment.
