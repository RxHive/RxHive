# Sodium Cromoglycate + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate
### Generic Name
Sodium Cromoglycate + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for the topical treatment of eye conditions characterized by inflammation and allergic reactions.  Sodium cromoglycate is a mast cell stabilizer, meaning it prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells.  Zinc sulfate possesses astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.  Together, they offer a synergistic effect in managing symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inner surface of the eyelids and covering the sclera), and other inflammatory eye conditions. While primarily used for allergic conjunctivitis, it might be prescribed off-label for other conditions based on a doctor's judgment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will always be provided by your doctor or pharmacist and should be strictly followed.  There's no standardized dosage across all brands or presentations.  Typically, the medication is available as eye drops. A common regimen involves instilling one or two drops in the affected eye(s) several times a day, as directed. The exact frequency and duration of treatment vary based on the severity of the condition and individual response.  **Never exceed the prescribed dosage.**  This medication is not intended for oral or intravenous (IV) administration.  Dosage for children may be adjusted based on age and the doctor's assessment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Temporary stinging or burning sensation upon application.
* Mild eye irritation.
* Blurred vision (usually temporary).


Less common, but more serious side effects require immediate medical attention:

* Severe eye pain.
* Persistent blurred vision.
* Eye redness or swelling that worsens.
* Development of an eye infection.


If any adverse effects occur, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Sodium cromoglycate works by stabilizing mast cells.  Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other inflammatory substances when triggered by allergens.  By preventing this release, sodium cromoglycate reduces the inflammatory response and associated symptoms like itching, redness, and swelling in the eye.  Zinc sulfate acts as an astringent, helping to reduce swelling and inflammation by constricting tissues. The combined action of these two components provides comprehensive management of allergic conjunctivitis symptoms.
