# Spectinomycin
### Generic Name
Spectinomycin

### Usage
Spectinomycin is an aminocyclitol aminoglycoside antibiotic used primarily to treat infections caused by susceptible strains of *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.  Its main applications are in treating acute gonorrheal infections in both males and females. This includes gonorrheal urethritis and proctitis in males, and gonorrheal cervicitis and proctitis in females.  It's important to note that spectinomycin's effectiveness is dependent on the susceptibility of the *N. gonorrhoeae* strain to the antibiotic.  It is not a first-line treatment for gonorrhea due to the emergence of resistant strains.  In children, its use is limited to specific situations and only under strict guidance from healthcare professionals.


### Dosage
Spectinomycin is administered intramuscularly (IM).  Dosage varies depending on the patient and the specific infection being treated.

**Adults (Gonorrhea):** The typical dose is a single 2-gram injection. A maximum dose of 4 grams may be administered, split between two separate injection sites.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of spectinomycin in children have not been fully established. However, in specific cases of uncomplicated gonococcal infections (vulvovaginitis, cervicitis, urethritis, pharyngitis, or proctitis) in children weighing less than 45 kg, and when ceftriaxone is not an option, a dose of 40 mg/kg as a single injection (up to a maximum of 2 grams) may be considered. *This should only be done under the strict supervision and direction of a healthcare professional.*

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with renal impairment, although hemodialysis does reduce serum spectinomycin levels by about 50%.  Avoid administering spectinomycin within 24 hours of dialysis.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment are not established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of spectinomycin can include:

* Chills
* Fever
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Insomnia
* Urticaria (hives)
* Pain at the injection site
* Rash
* Jaundice
* Elevated liver enzyme levels
* Dizziness
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Oliguria (reduced urine output)


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.


### How it Works
Spectinomycin works by binding to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.  This binding action inhibits protein synthesis within the bacteria, ultimately leading to their death and resolving the infection.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Spectinomycin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Drug Resistance:**  The use of spectinomycin, like any antibiotic, contributes to the development of drug-resistant bacteria.  It's crucial to use it only when absolutely necessary and as directed by a doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Spectinomycin is categorized as a Pregnancy Category B drug. While studies haven't shown harm to the fetus, it's important to use caution during pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Syphilis:** Spectinomycin is not effective against syphilis.  It can potentially mask or delay the symptoms of syphilis, so appropriate testing for syphilis is essential before and after treatment with spectinomycin.
* **Intravenous Use:** Spectinomycin should not be administered intravenously.  Intramuscular injections must be deep and into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal muscle.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for spectinomycin to work?** A:  The effects of spectinomycin generally become apparent within a short period after administration, but complete resolution of the infection may take longer.  Follow-up cultures are typically taken 96 hours post-treatment.

* **Q: Can I take spectinomycin with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.  Drug interactions may occur.

* **Q: How should I store spectinomycin?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Spectinomycin is typically given as a single dose. If you have questions or concerns about your treatment plan, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: Is spectinomycin safe for everyone?** A:  No, spectinomycin is not safe for everyone.  Individuals with hypersensitivity, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children should be treated with special caution and under strict medical supervision.
