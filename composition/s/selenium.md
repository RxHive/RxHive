# Selenium
### Generic Name
Selenium

### Usage

Selenium is a trace mineral essential for numerous bodily functions.  Its primary use is as a supplement to treat selenium deficiency. This deficiency can arise from various causes, including inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption issues, or certain medical conditions like prolonged parenteral nutrition (intravenous feeding). Selenium plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense systems, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.  It's also a component of several enzymes involved in thyroid hormone metabolism and immune function.  While not a primary treatment, it may be used as an additive in parenteral nutrition solutions to ensure adequate selenium intake in patients receiving long-term intravenous feeding.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the reason for selenium supplementation and the patient's age.  Always follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Dietary Supplement (RDA):** 55 mcg/day (Recommended Dietary Allowance). This is the general recommendation for healthy adults through food intake.
* **Parenteral Nutrition Additive:** 60-100 mcg/day intravenously.
* **Selenium Deficiency Treatment:** 100-200 mcg daily orally or intravenously, possibly up to 500 mcg/day in severe cases under strict medical supervision.

**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children and adolescents is based on age and weight, and is significantly lower than adult doses.  Specific recommendations should be obtained from a pediatrician. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) varies by age group and is considerably lower than the doses used to treat deficiency. Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on children's dosage. Parenteral nutrition additive doses are also weight-based and should be determined by the treating medical professional.

**Forms:** Selenium is available in various forms, including oral tablets, capsules, and intravenous or intramuscular injections.  The chosen form and route of administration will depend on the individual's needs and medical condition. Always follow administration instructions provided by your physician or pharmacist.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are rare at recommended dosages, but potential side effects include:

* Irritability (frequency not defined)

High doses of selenium can lead to more serious side effects, including:

* Hair loss
* Nail changes (brittleness)
* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
* Garlic breath odor
* Neurological symptoms (fatigue, weakness)

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe or unusual ones, stop taking the medication and consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Selenium is an essential component of several enzymes, most notably glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme is a crucial antioxidant that helps neutralize harmful free radicals, preventing cellular damage.  By acting as an antioxidant, selenium contributes to protecting cells and tissues from oxidative stress, thus supporting overall health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.  Selenium is also involved in thyroid hormone metabolism and immune system function.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Undiluted intravenous administration directly into a peripheral vein may be contraindicated (check product labeling).
* **Drug Interactions:** Selenium can interact with certain medications, such as dolutegravir and eltrombopag. Consult your healthcare professional about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Cautions:** Use caution in patients with gastrointestinal problems or kidney impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Selenium crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. While generally safe at recommended doses, pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before taking selenium supplements.  The RDA is higher during pregnancy and lactation.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take selenium supplements without a doctor's recommendation?**
A: While selenium is essential, taking supplements without consulting a doctor can be risky due to the potential for interactions or overdose.  It's always best to discuss supplementation with a healthcare professional who can assess your individual needs and determine the appropriate dosage.

**Q: How should I store selenium supplements?**
A: Follow the storage instructions on the product label.  Generally, supplements should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with selenium supplementation?**
A: Long-term use of high doses of selenium can lead to toxicity.  It's crucial to follow recommended dosages and consult your healthcare provider regularly.

**Q: What are the signs of selenium toxicity?**
A: Symptoms of selenium toxicity can include hair loss, nail changes, gastrointestinal problems, garlic breath, and neurological symptoms. If you experience any of these, seek medical attention immediately.

**Q:  Is selenium the same as selenite or selenomethionine?**
A: Selenite and selenomethionine are different chemical forms of selenium. Selenomethionine is generally considered to be better absorbed and tolerated than selenite. The form of selenium in a given supplement will be specified on the product label.
