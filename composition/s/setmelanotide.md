# Setmelanotide
### Generic Name
Setmelanotide

### Usage

Setmelanotide is used for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients (aged 6 years and older) with obesity caused by a deficiency in proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or the leptin receptor (LEPR).  This deficiency must be confirmed through genetic testing showing pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in the POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes.  It's crucial to understand that Setmelanotide is *not* indicated for treating obesity from other causes, including obesity linked to other genetic syndromes or general (polygenic) obesity.  In these cases, Setmelanotide is unlikely to be effective.

### Dosage

**Adults:** Setmelanotide is administered subcutaneously (under the skin). The initial dose is 2 mg once daily for two weeks.  The dosage may be adjusted based on individual response (weight loss, tolerability), aiming for a balance between efficacy and side effects. If more weight loss is desired, the dose can be increased. If side effects are problematic, the dose should be reduced.  Treatment should be discontinued if a 5% weight loss (from baseline body weight or BMI) isn't achieved after 12-16 weeks.

**Children (6 years and older):**  Dosage depends on age. For children aged 6 to 11 years, the initial dose is 1 mg once daily for two weeks.  For children 12 years and older, the initial dose is 2 mg once daily for two weeks.  Similar to adults, adjustments are made based on individual response, with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg. Treatment should be discontinued if a 5% weight loss (from baseline body weight or BMI) isn't achieved after 12-16 weeks.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic impairment. For those with renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²), or end-stage renal disease, Setmelanotide is not recommended.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Nervous system: Chills, depression, dizziness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, vertigo
*   Dermatologic: Alopecia (hair loss), skin hyperpigmentation (darkening), skin rash, dry skin
*   Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth
*   Genitourinary: Spontaneous erections (males)
*   Immunologic: Antibody development
*   Local: Injection site reactions
*   Musculoskeletal: Joint pain, weakness, back pain, limb pain, muscle spasms
*   Respiratory: Flu-like symptoms, upper respiratory tract infections

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Suicidal ideation.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Setmelanotide is a melanocortin 4 (MC4) receptor agonist.  It mimics the action of natural melanocortin peptides, primarily binding to and activating MC4 receptors in the brain.  These receptors play a crucial role in regulating appetite, satiety (feeling full), and energy expenditure. In individuals with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency, MC4 receptor activity is often insufficient. Setmelanotide helps to restore this activity, potentially reducing hunger, increasing energy expenditure, and leading to weight loss.

### Precautions

*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Because obesity is associated with increased risks during pregnancy, weight-loss medications are generally not recommended. Setmelanotide should be discontinued upon confirmation of pregnancy.  It's unknown whether Setmelanotide is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended.
*   **Children:** Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 6 years old.
*   **Sexual Side Effects:** Setmelanotide can cause changes in sexual arousal in both males and females.  Males may experience spontaneous erections; prolonged erections (>4 hours) require immediate medical attention.
*   **Depression and Suicidal Ideation:** There is an increased risk of depression and suicidal thoughts. Monitor for these carefully.
*   **Skin Changes:** Skin hyperpigmentation (darkening) can occur.  Monitor skin regularly.
*   **Renal Impairment:** Not recommended for individuals with significantly impaired kidney function.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Setmelanotide administered?**  A: It's administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily.
*   **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Resume your regular once-daily dose as soon as you remember.
*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Weight loss may be gradual.  Treatment is typically discontinued if there's no 5% weight loss after 12-16 weeks.
*   **Q: How should I store Setmelanotide?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication packaging.
*   **Q: Who should not use Setmelanotide?** A: Individuals with certain types of obesity (not related to POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiencies) and those with severely impaired kidney function should not use this medication. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also avoid it.
