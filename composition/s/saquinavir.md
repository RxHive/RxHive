# Saquinavir

**Generic Name:** Saquinavir

**Usage:** Saquinavir is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection.  It's typically used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to reduce the viral load and improve the CD4+ T-cell count.  It's NOT a cure for HIV.

**Side Effects:** Saquinavir, like other antiretroviral drugs, can cause a range of side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.  Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and changes in taste are frequently reported.  These are often dose-related and may improve with food.
* **Metabolic effects:**  Increased triglycerides and cholesterol levels, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), and insulin resistance are possible.
* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes (liver function tests) can occur.  In rare cases, more serious liver damage is possible.
* **Skin reactions:**  Rash is a relatively common side effect.
* **Neurological effects:**  Headache, dizziness, and peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities) have been reported.
* **Cardiovascular effects:**  Prolonged QT interval (a measure of heart rhythm) has been observed.


**How it Works:** Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor.  Protease is an enzyme HIV needs to replicate. By inhibiting this enzyme, saquinavir prevents the virus from producing infectious viral particles, thus slowing down the progression of HIV infection.


**FAQs:**

* **Is saquinavir still used?** While newer protease inhibitors are often preferred due to better tolerability and efficacy, saquinavir may still be used in certain situations, particularly in resource-limited settings or for patients who can't tolerate other medications.  Its use is often combined with ritonavir as a "boosting" agent to improve its effectiveness.

* **How is saquinavir administered?** Saquinavir is typically taken orally in capsule form.  Dosage and frequency vary depending on the individual's health and other medications they are taking.

* **What are the drug interactions?** Saquinavir has many potential drug interactions.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting saquinavir.

* **What are the long-term effects?** Long-term use of saquinavir, like other antiretrovirals, can have long-term consequences, including metabolic side effects like lipodystrophy (changes in body fat distribution), bone loss, and kidney problems.  Regular monitoring is essential.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any side effects, particularly severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.  Do not stop taking saquinavir without consulting your doctor.
