# Saquinavir
### Generic Name
Saquinavir

### Usage
Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor, a type of antiretroviral medication.  It's used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults (over 16 years old).  Crucially, saquinavir is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral agents, most notably ritonavir. It's not recommended as part of initial HIV treatment; it's typically reserved for patients who have already received other HIV therapies. The combination with ritonavir boosts saquinavir's effectiveness by increasing its levels in the body.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed before starting saquinavir therapy. Treatment should not begin if the pretreatment QT interval is ≥ 450 msec.  Saquinavir must always be co-administered with ritonavir; cobicistat is not a suitable substitute.

**Adults (≥16 years):**

* **Previously treated with Saquinavir/ritonavir:**  Saquinavir 1000 mg with ritonavir 100 mg, twice daily (BID), or in combination with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir.
* **Not previously treated with Saquinavir/ritonavir or switching from delavirdine or rilpivirine:**
    * **Initial dose:** Saquinavir 500 mg BID with ritonavir 100 mg BID for 7 days.
    * **Maintenance dose:** Saquinavir 1000 mg BID with ritonavir 100 mg BID.

**Pediatric (≥2 years and <16 years):**

Dosage is based on weight and prior treatment with Saquinavir/ritonavir.  It's always given with ritonavir. Consult the prescribing information for precise weight-based calculations. For adolescents ≥16 years, adult dosages apply.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No adjustment needed for mild-to-moderate impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B).  Saquinavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary, but use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

**Administration:** Saquinavir and ritonavir should be taken together within 2 hours of a full meal.  Capsules can be opened and mixed with a small amount of syrup or jam if swallowing is difficult; however, tablets should not be crushed.

**Important:** If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor.  HIV needs a protease enzyme to replicate. Saquinavir binds to the HIV protease, blocking its activity.  This prevents the virus from producing mature, infectious viral particles, thus inhibiting viral replication and slowing the progression of HIV infection.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to saquinavir or any component of the formulation.
* Congenital QT prolongation, refractory hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia.
* Concomitant use of drugs that both increase saquinavir levels and prolong the QT interval.
* Complete atrioventricular (AV) block (without a pacemaker).
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Co-administration with certain drugs (see prescribing information for a complete list).

**Warnings:**

* Saquinavir can increase the risk of hyperlipidemia, autoimmune disorders, QT and PR prolongation, torsades de pointes, and bleeding.
* Use with caution in patients with diabetes, alcoholism, hepatitis B or C, or cirrhosis.
* Monitor for side effects carefully, including lipid profiles, blood counts, and liver and kidney function.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding:  Saquinavir is a Category B drug in pregnancy.  The decision to use it during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, weighing the benefits and risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take saquinavir without ritonavir?** A: No. Saquinavir is always co-administered with ritonavir to enhance its effectiveness.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: How should I store saquinavir?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can saquinavir interact with other medications?** A: Yes, it can interact significantly with many other drugs. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions before starting saquinavir.
* **Q: Is saquinavir a cure for HIV?** A: No, it's not a cure.  It's an antiretroviral medication that helps manage the infection and improve the quality of life for people with HIV.  It must be taken consistently as prescribed.
