# Sodium Cromoglicate (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Sodium Cromoglicate (Nasal)

### Usage
Sodium cromoglicate nasal spray is a medication primarily used to prevent and relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and other nasal allergies.  These symptoms include a runny or itchy nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion caused by allergies. It works by stabilizing mast cells, preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances that trigger allergic reactions in the nasal passages.  While its primary use is for allergy symptom prevention and relief, it's not effective for treating a common cold, sinus infections, or asthma.


### Dosage
**Adults:** For allergic rhinitis, the typical dose is one spray (5.2 mg) in each nostril three to four times a day (TID or QID).  The dose may be increased to up to six times daily if needed.  For best results, start using the spray *before* exposure to allergens.  It may take one to two weeks to experience full symptom relief.

**Children (aged 2 years and older):**  The dosage for children aged 2 years and older is also one spray in each nostril three to four times daily, with a maximum of six times daily.  As with adults, prophylactic use (before allergen exposure) is recommended, and full symptom relief may take one to two weeks.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

**Administration:**  Always clear your nasal passages by gently blowing your nose before using the spray.  The nasal spray is for intranasal use only; do not ingest it.

### How it Works
Sodium cromoglicate nasal spray works by stabilizing mast cells.  Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals when triggered by allergens.  By stabilizing these mast cells, sodium cromoglicate prevents the release of these inflammatory substances, thereby reducing the allergic reaction and its associated symptoms in the nasal passages.  This means it prevents the allergic response rather than treating it after it has started.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Sodium cromoglicate nasal spray should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to sodium cromoglicate or any of its components.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  While generally well-tolerated, some individuals may experience local nasal effects such as brief stinging or sneezing.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sodium cromoglicate nasal spray may be used during pregnancy to treat allergic rhinitis.  The excretion of sodium cromoglicate in breast milk is unknown, however, it's considered compatible with breastfeeding according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2002).  Always consult your doctor about medication use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


**Other Precautions:**  Do not use sodium cromoglicate nasal spray to treat sinus infections, asthma, or the symptoms of a common cold.  It is strictly for the management of allergic rhinitis.
