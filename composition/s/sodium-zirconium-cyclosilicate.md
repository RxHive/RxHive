# Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
### Generic Name
Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate

### Usage
Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is primarily used to treat hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium in the blood) in adults.  It's a potassium binder, meaning it works within the digestive system to prevent potassium from being absorbed into the bloodstream. This medication is *not* for emergency treatment of life-threatening hyperkalemia due to its delayed action.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Treatment for hyperkalemia typically begins with an initial dose of 10 grams three times a day (TID) for up to 48 hours.  The doctor will then adjust the dose in 5-gram increments every week based on serum potassium levels.  The maintenance dose usually ranges from 5 grams every other day to 15 grams daily, with a maximum daily dose of 15 grams.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (liver disease):** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer.
* **Renal Impairment (kidney disease):**  No specific dosage adjustments are needed for mild to moderate impairment.  For patients undergoing hemodialysis (intermittent thrice-weekly), the initial dose on non-dialysis days is typically 5 grams daily (or 10 grams daily if the serum potassium level is above 6.5 mEq/L). The dose is adjusted weekly based on pre-dialysis potassium levels. The maintenance dose on non-dialysis days ranges from 5-15 grams daily.
* **Hypokalemia (low potassium):** If potassium levels drop too low, the dose should be decreased or the medication stopped.

**Administration:** The entire contents of the packet(s) should be emptied into at least 3 tablespoons (45 mL) of water, stirred well, and immediately consumed.  If powder remains, add more water, stir, and drink until all is gone.  Other oral medications should be taken at least 2 hours before or after sodium zirconium cyclosilicate.

### Side Effects

* **Common (frequency not defined but likely >10%):** Edema (swelling).
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Hypokalemia (low potassium levels).


Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention.  Always consult your doctor if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a non-absorbed, non-polymer zirconium silicate that acts as a potassium binder. It works within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, exchanging potassium for hydrogen and sodium ions. This process reduces the amount of free potassium in the gut, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. The bound potassium is then eliminated through the feces, lowering serum potassium levels.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or any of its components.
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of edema and hypokalemia, particularly in hemodialysis patients, should be carefully considered. Use with caution in patients with hemodialysis.
* **Interactions:** Co-administration with drugs that have pH-dependent solubility may alter absorption and effectiveness.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid use in patients with severe constipation, bowel obstruction, or impaction, including abnormal postoperative bowel motility disorders, as it may worsen these conditions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action is delayed, therefore it is not suitable for emergency treatment of hyperkalemia.  Therapeutic effects may take time to manifest.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with food?** A: While it can be administered with food, the instructions suggest it be taken with water to ensure complete mixing and absorption of the medication

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Consult with your physician for guidance.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  Store according to the manufacturer's instructions on the packaging. Usually it's best to store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.

* **Q: Is it safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  Since sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not systemically absorbed, exposure to the fetus or infant through breast milk is not expected. However, always consult with your doctor before taking any medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
