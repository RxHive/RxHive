# Selinexor
### Generic Name
Selinexor

### Usage

Selinexor is a medication used to treat certain types of blood cancers.  Its primary use is in adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, that hasn't responded to at least two previous treatments.  This includes DLBCL that developed from follicular lymphoma.

Importantly, Selinexor is also used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, another type of blood cancer.  It's used in combination with other drugs.  One regimen involves combining it with bortezomib and dexamethasone for adults who have received at least one prior therapy. Another regimen uses Selinexor with dexamethasone for adults who have received at least four prior therapies and whose myeloma is resistant to at least two proteasome inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.


### Dosage

Selinexor dosage varies greatly depending on the specific cancer being treated and the patient's prior treatment history.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.  The medication is always administered orally (by mouth).


**Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL):** The typical dose is 60 mg twice weekly, on days 1 and 3 of each week (120 mg total per week).  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

**Multiple Myeloma (in combination with other drugs):**

* **SVd regimen (at least 1 prior therapy):** 100 mg once weekly on day 1, in combination with bortezomib (administered subcutaneously) and dexamethasone (oral).
* **Sd regimen (at least 4 prior therapies):** 80 mg twice weekly on days 1 and 3, in combination with dexamethasone (oral).  


Dosage adjustments are frequently made based on individual tolerance and side effects (see Dosage Adjustments section).  There are no specific dosage adjustments for mild hepatic impairment, renal impairment including end-stage renal disease, or for those requiring hemodialysis, however it's essential to monitor patients closely in these situations.  Selinexor is not approved for use in children.

### Side Effects

Selinexor can cause a range of side effects, some common and some less frequent but more serious.  Always inform your doctor about any side effects.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Weight loss
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Neurological signs and symptoms
* Mental status changes


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Serious infections (pneumonia, sepsis)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Delirium
* Impaired consciousness

* Severe gastrointestinal problems


If you experience any severe or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Selinexor is a nuclear export inhibitor.  It works by blocking a protein called exportin 1, which is responsible for transporting certain molecules out of the cell's nucleus.  By inhibiting exportin 1, Selinexor prevents the removal of tumor suppressor proteins from the nucleus. This leads to an increase in tumor suppressor proteins in the nucleus, a decrease in oncoproteins, and ultimately, cancer cell death (apoptosis) and cell cycle arrest.  When used in combination with other drugs like bortezomib and dexamethasone, Selinexor's effects are enhanced, leading to improved anti-cancer activity.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Selinexor can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after the last dose.  Pregnant women should not use this drug.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether Selinexor passes into breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week after the final dose.
* **Drug Interactions:** Selinexor can interact with many other drugs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor closely for side effects, particularly low blood cell counts (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia), low sodium levels (hyponatremia), and neurological problems.  Patients should avoid hazardous activities (driving, operating heavy machinery) until neurological side effects resolve.


### FAQs
