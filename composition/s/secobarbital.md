# Secobarbital
### Generic Name
Secobarbital

### Usage
Secobarbital, also known as quinalbarbitone, is a barbiturate primarily used for short-term treatment of insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and as a pre-operative sedative before surgical procedures.  It's important to note that the use of secobarbital is largely outdated and has been replaced by newer, safer medications for these purposes.  Its use is generally not recommended except in very specific situations where other options have been deemed unsuitable by a medical professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Insomnia:**  The oral dose is typically 100 mg at bedtime.  Treatment should not exceed two weeks.
* **Preoperative Sedation:** The oral dose is usually 200-300 mg administered 1-2 hours before the procedure.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Secobarbital's use in children and adolescents is extremely limited and largely discouraged due to the availability of safer alternatives.  In rare instances, for pre-operative sedation, the oral dose might be calculated as 2-6 mg/kg of body weight 1-2 hours before the procedure. The maximum dose should not exceed 100 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for mild-to-moderate liver impairment. However, caution is advised, and a dose reduction may be necessary.  Secobarbital is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for renal impairment. However, caution is warranted, and dose reduction may be considered.

### How it Works

Secobarbital is a barbiturate that acts on the central nervous system. It works by binding to specific receptors in the brain, enhancing the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits brain activity.  This leads to a reduction in overall brain activity, resulting in sedation and sleepiness. At higher doses, it can have more direct effects on nerve cells, further depressing brain function.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Secobarbital is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to barbiturates or any component of the medication, active porphyria (a genetic disorder), dyspnea (shortness of breath) or airway obstruction, and severe hepatic impairment.
* **Interactions:** Secobarbital can interact with many other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver.  It can decrease the effectiveness of certain antiviral medications.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Secobarbital is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Use during pregnancy, particularly the third trimester, should be avoided.  It is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or respiratory disorders, depression or suicidal tendencies, a history of drug abuse or alcoholism, hepatic or renal impairment, and acute or chronic pain.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take secobarbital with alcohol?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided while taking secobarbital as it can increase the risk of CNS depression and other adverse effects.

* **Q: How should I store secobarbital?** A: Store secobarbital at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking secobarbital suddenly?** A: No, abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous and lead to serious complications, including seizures.  Always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.

* **Q: Is secobarbital addictive?** A: Yes, secobarbital is a controlled substance with a potential for dependence, tolerance, and addiction.  It should only be used as prescribed and for the shortest possible duration.

* **Q: Are there safer alternatives to secobarbital for insomnia or pre-operative sedation?** A:  Yes, many safer and more effective alternatives exist for both insomnia and pre-operative sedation. Your doctor can discuss these options with you.
