# Sofosbuvir + Velpatasvir

**Generic Name:** Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir

**Usage:**  Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir is a fixed-dose combination used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infections in adults.  The specific regimen (duration and dosage) will vary depending on the patient's genotype, prior treatment history, and liver disease severity.  It's often used as a part of a combination therapy, potentially with ribavirin, depending on the circumstances.  This medication is typically taken orally once daily.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects are generally mild to moderate and include:

* **Headache:** A frequent complaint.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Depression:** Feelings of sadness or hopelessness.
* **Muscle aches:** Pain or soreness in the muscles.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or eruption.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:** This is monitored through blood tests and usually resolves without intervention.


Serious side effects are less common but can include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, or hives.
* **Liver failure:** Although rare, this is a serious complication that requires immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:** Sofosbuvir inhibits the HCV NS5B polymerase, an enzyme essential for viral replication.  Velpatasvir inhibits the HCV NS5A protein, another crucial component of the viral lifecycle.  By targeting different stages of the virus's replication process, this combination effectively prevents the virus from multiplying and allows the body's immune system to clear the infection.
