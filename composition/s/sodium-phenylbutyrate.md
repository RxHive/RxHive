# Sodium Phenylbutyrate
### Generic Name
Sodium Phenylbutyrate

### Usage
Sodium phenylbutyrate is primarily used as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of urea cycle disorders (UCDs).  These are inherited metabolic disorders affecting the body's ability to eliminate nitrogenous waste products.  Specifically, it's indicated for individuals with deficiencies in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, or argininosuccinic acid synthetase.  It's employed in both neonatal-onset (presenting within the first 28 days of life) and late-onset UCDs (appearing after the first month of life) in patients with a history of hyperammonemic encephalopathy (a potentially life-threatening condition caused by high levels of ammonia in the blood).  Sodium phenylbutyrate helps to reduce the buildup of ammonia by providing an alternative pathway for nitrogen excretion.

### Dosage
Dosage varies considerably based on age and weight, and must always be determined by a physician based on individual needs and response to therapy.  

**Adults (Urea cycle disorders, chronic management):**  The usual oral dose is 9.9–13 g/m²/day, divided into 3–6 doses taken daily.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 g.  Doses exceeding 20 g/day have not been proven safe or effective.

**Children (Urea cycle disorders, chronic management):**  For children weighing less than 20 kg, the recommended dose is 450–600 mg/kg/day, divided and given with meals or feedings 3–6 times a day. For children weighing 20 kg or more, the adult dosage applies. Again, the maximum daily dose is 20 g.

**Dosage Forms:** Sodium phenylbutyrate is available as a powder and tablets. The powder can be mixed with food or water; tablets should be swallowed whole.  Specific administration guidelines (e.g., using a feeding tube) may be necessary depending on the patient's condition.  Always follow your doctor’s instructions and the product labeling exactly.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is advised when using this medication in patients with these conditions.

### Side Effects
Sodium phenylbutyrate can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
* Menstrual disorders
* Acidosis (increased blood acidity)
* Hypoalbuminemia (low blood albumin levels)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Depression
* Headache
* Syncope (fainting)
* Body odor
* Skin rash
* Alkalosis (increased blood alkalinity)
* Hyperchloremia (high blood chloride levels)
* Hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate levels)
* Decreased serum total protein
* Hyperuricemia (high blood uric acid levels)
* Hyperphosphatemia (high blood phosphate levels)
* Hypernatremia (high blood sodium levels)
* Hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Abdominal pain
* Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anemia
* Leukocytosis (high white blood cell count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Thrombocythemia (high platelet count)
* Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels
* Increased serum transaminase levels (liver enzymes)
* Hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin levels)
* Renal tubular acidosis


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Aplastic anemia (severe bone marrow failure)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Peptic ulcer

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Sodium phenylbutyrate acts as a prodrug, meaning it's converted into an active form within the body.  It's rapidly metabolized to phenylacetate, which then combines with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine.  This compound is then excreted in the urine, effectively removing excess nitrogen from the body.  This alternative pathway helps to lower ammonia levels in patients with urea cycle disorders, preventing the accumulation of toxic substances.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Sodium phenylbutyrate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.  It is also contraindicated in the acute management of hyperammonemia and, according to the Canadian labeling, during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Sodium phenylbutyrate may interact with other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  This includes drugs such as amodiaquine, benperidol, clozapine, corticosteroids, haloperidol, probenecid, tizanidine, and valproate.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Sodium phenylbutyrate can cause sodium and fluid retention;  therefore, careful monitoring is essential, especially in patients with heart failure or other conditions where fluid retention could be problematic.  It's also crucial to monitor for hyperammonemia and neurotoxicity.  Caution is advised in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, those on low sodium diets, and those with inborn errors of beta-oxidation.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use in pregnant and breastfeeding women should be carefully considered,  and the Canadian labeling specifically contraindicates its use in these populations.  Dosage adjustments for children are necessary, as outlined above.  Older adults should be monitored closely for side effects.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Sodium phenylbutyrate to work?**  A: The onset of action and therapeutic effect vary depending on the individual and severity of the condition.  Ammonia levels should be closely monitored to assess the effectiveness of treatment.

**Q: How should I store Sodium phenylbutyrate?** A: Store as directed on the product label. Typically, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I stop taking Sodium phenylbutyrate abruptly?** A: No, never stop taking Sodium phenylbutyrate without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation may lead to dangerous complications.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

**Q: Is Sodium phenylbutyrate safe for long-term use?** A: Sodium phenylbutyrate is often required for long-term management of UCDs,  but regular monitoring and assessment by a healthcare professional are vital.

**Q: Are there any dietary restrictions while taking Sodium phenylbutyrate?** A: Yes. Sodium phenylbutyrate is usually used in conjunction with a protein-restricted diet and, if needed, essential amino acid supplementation.
