# Short Ragweed Pollen Allergen Extract
### Generic Name
Short Ragweed Pollen Allergen Extract

### Usage
Short ragweed pollen allergen extract is a medication used in immunotherapy to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and allergic conjunctivitis caused by short ragweed pollen ( *Ambrosia artemisiifolia*).  This treatment is appropriate for individuals aged 5 to 65 who have a confirmed allergy to short ragweed pollen, demonstrated through a positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific IgE antibodies.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* for immediate relief of allergy symptoms; it's a long-term treatment to modify the immune response.

### Dosage

**Adults (≤65 years):** The recommended dose is one 12 Amb a 1-U tablet sublingually (under the tongue) once daily. Treatment should begin at least 12 weeks before the expected start of the ragweed pollen season and continue throughout the season.  The first dose must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in allergy treatment, with observation for at least 30 minutes afterward.

**Children (≥5 years):**  The dosage is the same as for adults (one 12 Amb a 1-U tablet sublingually once daily).  Children should also receive a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector for emergency use in case of a severe allergic reaction.

**Important Note:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established for individuals over 65 years or under 5 years of age.  No dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Short ragweed pollen allergen extract works through a process called specific immunotherapy (SIT).  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to gradually shift the immune system's response to ragweed pollen from a type 2 helper T-cell response (Th2, associated with allergy) to a type 1 helper T-cell response (Th1, less likely to cause allergic reactions).  This involves changes in cytokine production (e.g., increased IL-10, decreased IL-4 and IL-5), the production of IgG-blocking antibodies that compete with IgE for allergen binding, and alterations in the activity of immune cells like mast cells and eosinophils.  The overall result is a reduction in the allergic response.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity to any of the inactive ingredients (gelatin, mannitol, sodium hydroxide) or other components.
* Severe, unstable, or uncontrolled asthma.
* History of severe systemic allergic reactions or severe local reactions to sublingual allergen immunotherapy.
* History of eosinophilic esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus).


**Warnings:** There is an increased risk of eosinophilic esophagitis, systemic allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), and upper airway compromise.  A boxed warning emphasizes the potential for life-threatening allergic reactions; patients should be monitored closely, especially after the initial dose.  An epinephrine auto-injector should be readily available, and patients must be trained on its use.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Allergen immunotherapy is generally not initiated during pregnancy.  The effect on breastfeeding is unknown; the decision to breastfeed during treatment should be made carefully, weighing the risks and benefits.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication if I have other allergies?** A: Consult your doctor.  Other allergies may influence the decision to use this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the next dose at the scheduled time; do not double the dose.  Consult your doctor if you miss multiple doses.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
