# Sodium Selenate
### Generic Name
Sodium Selenate

### Usage

Sodium selenate is primarily used as a dietary supplement to provide selenium, an essential trace mineral.  Selenium plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, acting as a component of glutathione peroxidase, an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells from damage caused by free radicals.  While often found in multivitamins or mineral supplements, it's less common as a standalone medication.  Its use is generally to correct or prevent selenium deficiency, a condition that can lead to various health problems.  Note that sodium selenate should only be used as directed by a healthcare professional and is not a treatment for any specific disease on its own.


### Dosage

Dosage of sodium selenate varies significantly based on individual needs and the specific formulation of the supplement.  It's **crucial to follow the directions on the product label carefully or as advised by your physician**.  There is no universally recommended dosage for sodium selenate, as the appropriate amount depends on factors such as age, overall health, and pre-existing conditions.  Self-treating with selenium supplements can be dangerous.  Overdosing on selenium can lead to serious health problems.  Children, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and individuals with underlying medical conditions should always consult a doctor before using selenium supplements containing sodium selenate.   Never exceed the recommended dose.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of sodium selenate, especially at high doses, can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Hair loss
* Brittle nails
* Garlic breath odor
* Fatigue

More serious but less frequent side effects can include:

* Neurological problems (e.g., nerve damage)
* Liver damage
* Kidney damage


If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Sodium selenate provides selenium, which is incorporated into various selenoproteins within the body.  The most significant of these is glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that neutralizes harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals.  These free radicals are byproducts of metabolism and can damage cellular components, contributing to aging and various diseases. By boosting the activity of glutathione peroxidase, selenium helps to protect cells from oxidative damage.  Selenium also plays a role in thyroid hormone metabolism and immune function.


### Precautions

* **Toxicity:** Sodium selenate is considered toxic in high doses.  It's crucial to avoid exceeding the recommended dosage.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While not extensively studied, interactions with other medications are possible.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a healthcare professional before using sodium selenate supplements, as selenium can cross the placental barrier and enter breast milk.
