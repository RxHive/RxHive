# Salbutamol + Sodium Cromoglycate

**Generic Name:** Salbutamol + Sodium Cromoglycate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to prevent and treat wheezing and shortness of breath associated with asthma and other reversible airway obstructive diseases.  Salbutamol, a beta-2 agonist, provides quick relief by relaxing the muscles around the airways. Sodium cromoglycate, a mast cell stabilizer, helps prevent the release of substances that cause inflammation and airway narrowing. This combination is often used in patients who experience both acute symptoms needing immediate relief and ongoing inflammation requiring preventative treatment.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription regarding usage and dosage.  It is not a replacement for other prescribed asthma medications.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Salbutamol-related:** Tremor, headache, muscle cramps, palpitations, nervousness, dizziness, increased heart rate.  Severe side effects are rare but include serious heart problems.
* **Sodium Cromoglycate-related:**  Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals might experience a cough, throat irritation, or a bitter taste.

It's essential to report any unusual or worsening symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

* **Salbutamol:** Works by binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs, causing the muscles surrounding the airways to relax. This opens the airways, allowing for easier breathing.  The effect is relatively quick, providing immediate relief from bronchospasm.
* **Sodium Cromoglycate:**  Works by stabilizing mast cells in the airways. Mast cells release inflammatory substances (histamine, leukotrienes) that contribute to airway narrowing and inflammation. By stabilizing these cells, sodium cromoglycate reduces the release of these substances, preventing or minimizing an asthma attack.  Its effect is preventative rather than immediately relieving.
