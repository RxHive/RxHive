# Sodium Hydroxide
### Generic Name
Sodium Hydroxide

### Usage

Sodium hydroxide, also known as lye or caustic soda, is a highly alkaline substance with diverse applications, though its medicinal uses are limited and primarily relate to its caustic properties.  It's not used as a typical pharmaceutical drug for treating specific diseases like antibiotics or antihypertensives.  Its main medicinal application is historical and experimental, rather than widespread clinical practice.

Historically, it's been used in escharotic preparations (substances that destroy tissue) â€“ a mixture of sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide, known as London paste, was used to destroy warts and other superficial skin lesions. This method is largely outdated due to the risk of scarring and other complications.  Further, its use in conjunction with glycerol was explored as a cuticle solvent.

More recently, research has explored sodium hydroxide's potential in treating prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Kuru.  Studies have shown it can reduce prion levels *in vitro* (in a lab setting), but its efficacy and safety in humans for this purpose haven't been fully established. Its use in this context is experimental and not a standard treatment.  It's also used to adjust the pH of solutions in various laboratory and manufacturing settings, although this is not a direct medicinal application.


### Dosage

There are no standard medicinal dosages for sodium hydroxide for internal use.  Its highly caustic nature makes internal ingestion extremely dangerous and potentially fatal.  External applications (historical uses like in London paste) were highly variable and depended on the specific preparation and the area treated. This method is not recommended due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.  Any use of sodium hydroxide for medicinal purposes should only be under the direct supervision of a qualified medical professional and is not recommended for self-treatment.

### Side Effects

Because of its caustic nature, contact with sodium hydroxide can cause severe side effects, including:

* **Skin burns:** ranging from mild irritation to deep, full-thickness burns, depending on concentration and exposure time.
* **Eye damage:**  Severe irritation, corneal burns, and potential vision loss.
* **Respiratory problems:**  Inhalation of sodium hydroxide dust or fumes can cause irritation, coughing, and shortness of breath.  More severe cases could lead to lung damage.
* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Ingestion causes severe burning, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and potentially perforation of the esophagus or stomach.


**Serious, though less common, effects** can include scarring, permanent vision impairment, and even death from ingestion or severe burns.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any adverse effects after contact with sodium hydroxide.**

### How it Works

Sodium hydroxide's action is primarily based on its strong alkalinity. In aqueous solutions, it dissociates into sodium and hydroxide ions (OH-).  The high concentration of hydroxide ions causes a significant increase in pH, making it highly alkaline. This high alkalinity disrupts the chemical bonds in proteins and other biological molecules.  Its destructive effect on tissue is the basis of its (now largely obsolete) historical use as an escharotic agent. In the context of prion research, it's believed to denature prion proteins, rendering them less infectious.

### Precautions

* **Extremely corrosive:** Sodium hydroxide is extremely corrosive and should be handled with extreme caution.  Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, eye protection, and a lab coat.
* **Avoid contact:** Avoid direct contact with skin, eyes, or mucous membranes.
* **Ingestion:**  Ingestion is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.  Immediate medical attention is required if ingestion occurs.
* **Inhalation:**  Avoid inhalation of dust or fumes.  Use adequate ventilation when working with sodium hydroxide.
* **Storage:**  Store in a cool, dry place, away from incompatible substances.  Keep out of reach of children.
* **Interactions:** The interactions of Sodium Hydroxide are not relevant in a medicinal context as its medicinal use is limited and largely experimental. In industrial settings, reactions with acids can be violent.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There is no established safe use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Avoid contact entirely.
* **Children and Elderly:**  Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of sodium hydroxide.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is sodium hydroxide safe for use at home?** A: No. Sodium hydroxide is a highly corrosive substance and should only be handled by trained professionals in controlled settings.

* **Q: Can I use sodium hydroxide to treat warts or other skin conditions?** A: No. Safer and more effective treatments are available.  Using sodium hydroxide for this purpose is highly discouraged due to the risk of severe burns and scarring.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get sodium hydroxide on my skin or in my eyes?** A: Immediately flush the affected area with copious amounts of water for at least 15-20 minutes. Seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store sodium hydroxide?** A: Store in a tightly sealed container in a cool, dry place, away from incompatible materials and out of reach of children.
