# Sarilumab
### Generic Name
Sarilumab

### Usage
Sarilumab is primarily used to treat moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults.  It's specifically indicated for those who haven't responded adequately to, or who are intolerant of, one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  This means it's used when other treatments haven't been sufficiently effective or have caused unacceptable side effects.  Currently, it's not approved for use in children.

### Dosage
Sarilumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  For adults with rheumatoid arthritis, the typical dose is 200 mg every two weeks. This is usually given in combination with methotrexate or other conventional DMARDs.  It can also be used as a monotherapy (alone) or with non-biologic DMARDs, but it should *not* be combined with biologic DMARDs.  Before starting Sarilumab, certain blood tests (absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, ALT, and AST levels) are necessary to ensure the patient is suitable for treatment.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on blood test results, particularly liver function (ALT, AST levels) and blood cell counts (ANC, platelets).  Specific adjustments are detailed in the prescribing information and should be made under a doctor's guidance.  There is no established pediatric dosage.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10%):

* Increased serum levels of ALT and AST (liver enzymes)

Common side effects (1-10%):

* Hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides)
* Oral herpes simplex infection
* Urinary tract infection
* Decreased platelet count, leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Injection-site pruritus (itching)
* Antibody development
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site and injection-site reactions
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and pharynx) and upper respiratory tract infection


Less common, but serious side effects (<1% or frequency not defined):

* Gastrointestinal perforation (hole in the digestive tract)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Increased levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol
* Malignant neoplasm (cancer)
* Pneumonia
* Cellulitis (skin infection)
* Serious infections (including opportunistic infections like candidiasis, tuberculosis, and infections caused by *Pneumocystis* organisms).

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Sarilumab is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist.  IL-6 is a protein involved in inflammation.  Sarilumab works by binding to IL-6 receptors, both on the surface of cells (membrane-bound) and those circulating in the blood (soluble). By blocking these receptors, Sarilumab prevents IL-6 from triggering inflammatory responses.  This reduction in inflammation helps to alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

### Precautions
Sarilumab is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Sarilumab or any of its components.  It carries a black box warning regarding the increased risk of serious infections, including tuberculosis, fungal infections, and opportunistic infections. Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis before starting treatment and monitored closely for signs of infection during therapy.  The drug should be used cautiously in elderly patients and those with pre-existing conditions that might increase their susceptibility to infection.  Sarilumab may interact with other medications, including certain immunosuppressants, vaccines, and other drugs metabolized by the liver.  Concomitant use with biologic DMARDs is specifically contraindicated.  Itâ€™s important to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Pregnancy and breastfeeding:  The safety of Sarilumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established, thus caution is advised.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of oral contraceptives may be reduced while on Sarilumab.
