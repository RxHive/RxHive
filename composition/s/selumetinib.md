# Selumetinib
### Generic Name
Selumetinib

### Usage
Selumetinib is a medication primarily used to treat pediatric patients (aged 2 years and older) with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Specifically, it's indicated for those with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN), which are benign tumors that can cause significant pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment.  Currently, there are no approved uses for Selumetinib in adults or for other conditions.

### Dosage

Selumetinib dosage is determined based on the child's body surface area (BSA) and is administered orally.  The recommended dose is 25 mg/m² twice daily (BID), approximately every 12 hours, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

**Dosage based on BSA (for children ≥2 years with BSA ≥ 0.55 m²):**

* BSA 0.55-0.69 m²: 20 mg morning, 10 mg evening
* BSA 0.7-0.89 m²: 20 mg BID
* BSA 0.9-1.09 m²: 25 mg BID
* BSA 1.1-1.29 m²: 30 mg BID
* BSA 1.3-1.49 m²: 35 mg BID
* BSA 1.5-1.69 m²: 40 mg BID
* BSA 1.7-1.89 m²: 45 mg BID
* BSA ≥1.9 m²: 50 mg BID

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage reduction is necessary for moderate hepatic impairment.  Specific adjustments are detailed in the prescribing information and are BSA-dependent.  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for any degree of renal impairment, including end-stage kidney disease.
* **Adverse Reactions:** Dose reduction is required for certain adverse reactions like cardiomyopathy, ocular toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and skin toxicity.  The specific adjustments depend on the severity of the reaction and the child's BSA.  The medication should be permanently discontinued if intolerable adverse effects persist after two dose reductions.

**Administration:** Selumetinib capsules should be swallowed whole with water; do not chew, crush, or open the capsule.  It's best taken on an empty stomach (2 hours before or 1 hour after a meal).  If vomiting occurs, do not take an additional dose; continue with the next scheduled dose. Missed doses should only be taken if it's more than 6 hours until the next scheduled dose.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in >10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Cardiomyopathy
* Edema (swelling)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Reduced ejection fraction
* Sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Acne
* Hair changes
* Changes in liver function tests (LFTs)

Less common, but serious side effects include:

* Retinal pigment epithelial detachment
* Retinal vein occlusion
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Severe skin reactions

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Selumetinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor.  Specifically, it inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2). MEK1/2 are enzymes involved in a signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) crucial for cell growth and division.  By blocking MEK1/2, Selumetinib reduces the activity of this pathway, thereby slowing the growth of plexiform neurofibromas in patients with NF1.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Selumetinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after the last dose.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown if Selumetinib is excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Selumetinib's metabolism can be affected by strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (like certain antifungals) or inducers.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting Selumetinib.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. No adjustment is needed for renal impairment.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of heart function (echocardiogram), liver function tests (LFTs), and blood counts is recommended.  Eye exams are also important, particularly if any vision changes occur.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Selumetinib?** A: Store Selumetinib at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I take Selumetinib with food?** A: It's best to take Selumetinib on an empty stomach.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a missed dose unless it is more than 6 hours until your next scheduled dose.
* **Q: What are the serious side effects?** A: Serious side effects include cardiomyopathy, retinal detachment, severe gastrointestinal problems, and severe skin reactions. Consult your doctor immediately if you experience these.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Selumetinib?** A:  This should be discussed with your doctor as alcohol could potentially interact or exacerbate some side effects.
