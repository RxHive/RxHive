# Sodium Citrate

**Generic Name:** Sodium Citrate

**Usage:**

Sodium citrate has several uses, depending on its formulation and concentration:

* **Treatment of Metabolic Acidosis:**  This is a primary use. Sodium citrate acts as a systemic alkalinizer, helping to raise the pH of the blood when it's become too acidic (metabolic acidosis). This is often seen in kidney failure or severe diarrhea.

* **Anticoagulant (in blood collection tubes):**  Sodium citrate binds to calcium ions in blood, preventing blood clotting.  This is crucial for blood collection and storage for tests and transfusions.  This use is *not* for treating blood clots within the body.

* **Urinary Alkalinizer:** It can help to alkalinize urine, making it less acidic. This can be helpful in treating certain urinary tract infections or conditions that cause kidney stones that are aggravated by acidic urine.

* **Food Additive:**  Sodium citrate is used as a food additive (E331) for its flavoring, buffering, and preservative properties. It's found in many processed foods and beverages.

* **Laxative (some formulations):** In higher doses, it can have a laxative effect by drawing water into the intestines.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and depend on the dose and route of administration.  Possible side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps. These are more common with higher doses or oral ingestion.
* **Metabolic Alkalosis (rare but serious):** In cases of overuse or kidney impairment, sodium citrate can cause the blood to become too alkaline.
* **Hypocalcemia (rare but serious):**  Large doses can chelate calcium, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.  This is mostly a concern with intravenous administration.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions (such as rash, itching, swelling) are possible.


**How it Works:**

Sodium citrate's main mechanism of action revolves around its ability to act as a buffer and chelator:

* **Buffering:** It can neutralize acids in the body, thereby raising the pH.  This is crucial in treating acidosis.
* **Calcium Chelation:** It binds to calcium ions, preventing them from participating in the blood clotting cascade.


**FAQs:**

* **Is sodium citrate safe?**  Generally, sodium citrate is considered safe when used as directed. However, excessive use or use in individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g., kidney disease) can lead to adverse effects. Always consult a doctor before using it.

* **Can I take sodium citrate without a doctor's prescription?**  For some uses (like as a food additive), it's fine. However, for medical purposes (treating acidosis, alkalinizing urine), a prescription and medical supervision are usually necessary.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any concerning side effects, stop using sodium citrate and contact your doctor immediately.

* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Sodium citrate can interact with certain medications, particularly those affecting electrolyte balance or kidney function.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **What is the difference between sodium citrate and citric acid?** Citric acid is an organic acid, while sodium citrate is a salt of citric acid. Sodium citrate is less acidic than citric acid.
