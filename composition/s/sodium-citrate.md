# Sodium Citrate
### Generic Name
Sodium Citrate

### Usage
Sodium citrate's primary use is as an alkalinizing agent before general anesthesia for cesarean sections.  It helps to adjust the body's acid-base balance (pH) to a more alkaline state, which can be beneficial during certain surgical procedures.  It's not typically used for other conditions.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  For use as an alkalinizing agent before general anesthesia for cesarean sections, the typical oral dose is 30 mL of a 0.3 M solution administered immediately prior to the anesthesia.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Sodium citrate is not indicated for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment, but caution is advised.  In patients with renal (kidney) impairment, use extreme caution is necessary.  Frequent monitoring of serum electrolyte levels and acid-base status is crucial, especially when treating acidosis.  Remember, altering urine pH can affect the elimination of other medications.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, though the frequency isn't specified, can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach pain
* Water retention

While less common, more serious side effects are possible.  Always consult a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works
Sodium citrate acts as a weak base. When ingested, it reacts with stomach acid (hydrochloric acid), raising the stomach's pH.  It's further metabolized to bicarbonate, which then increases the pH of both the blood and urine, creating a more alkaline environment in the body.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Sodium citrate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to sodium citrate or any of its components.

**Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of elevated aluminum levels in patients with kidney impairment if using sodium citrate concurrently with products containing aluminum.

**Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using sodium citrate in patients with:

* Heart failure
* Edema (swelling)
* Renal impairment
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Aldosteronism (a hormone disorder)

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sodium citrate is categorized as Pregnancy Category C (risk to fetus cannot be ruled out). It's not recommended for use during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

**Q: How is sodium citrate stored?**
A:  Storage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation. Always refer to the product label for the correct storage conditions.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Sodium citrate, in the context described here, is administered immediately before a specific procedure (cesarean section). A missed dose would require consultation with the anesthesiologist.

**Q: What happens if I overdose on sodium citrate?**
A:  An overdose can lead to metabolic alkalosis. Management involves monitoring plasma electrolyte levels and acid-base status, along with general supportive measures.

**Q: Can I take sodium citrate with other medications?**
A:  Oral citrate can increase the absorption of aluminum from the gut; therefore, concurrent use with aluminum-containing products should be avoided.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potential interactions.
