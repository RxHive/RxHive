# Sumatriptan (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Sumatriptan (Systemic)

### Usage
Sumatriptan is a triptan medication primarily used for the acute treatment of migraine headaches, both with and without aura, in adults.  It's a powerful tool to relieve the pain and associated symptoms of a migraine attack once it has begun. Importantly, it is *not* for preventing migraines from occurring.  Sumatriptan injection is also approved for the acute treatment of cluster headaches in adults.  It's crucial to receive a proper diagnosis of migraine or cluster headache from a healthcare professional before using sumatriptan.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Migraine (Oral):**  The initial dose is typically 50-100 mg. If the headache partially subsides or returns after several hours, a second dose (usually the same as the first) can be taken after at least 2 hours. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg.
* **Migraine (Subcutaneous Injection):** The initial dose is 6 mg. If needed, a second dose (usually the same) can be given after at least 1 hour.  If 6 mg isn't well-tolerated, a doctor might prescribe lower doses (1-5 mg). The maximum daily dose is 12 mg.
* **Cluster Headache (Subcutaneous Injection):** The initial dose is 6 mg.  If effective but the headache returns, the same dose can be repeated after at least 1 hour. The maximum daily dose is 12 mg.


**Children and Adolescents:**

The use of oral sumatriptan is not established in children under 18. Subcutaneous sumatriptan may be used in children aged 6 years and older and adolescents up to 17 years old, but dosage should be determined by a physician based on factors like weight and response to the medication. Adolescents aged 18 and older may follow the adult dosage guidelines.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be needed for individuals with liver or kidney problems.  Consult a doctor before taking sumatriptan if you have any liver or kidney issues.  Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment.

### How it Works

Sumatriptan works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain and reducing the release of substances that can cause pain and inflammation associated with migraine and cluster headaches.  It targets specific serotonin receptors (5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors) in the brain and blood vessels, helping to alleviate the symptoms of these headaches.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sumatriptan is contraindicated in people with certain heart conditions (e.g., coronary artery disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure), history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral vascular disease, severe liver impairment, use of ergotamine or other triptans within 24 hours, use with MAO inhibitors, and those with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or other cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Sumatriptan can interact with several medications, including other migraine medications (ergotamines, other triptans), MAO inhibitors, certain antidepressants, and other drugs. Discuss all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies with your doctor before using sumatriptan.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Sumatriptan should be used cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.  It's recommended to avoid breastfeeding for 12 hours after taking sumatriptan.
* **Older Adults and Children:**  Use caution in older adults and children, as they may be more susceptible to side effects.
