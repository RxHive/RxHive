# Sodium Perborate
### Generic Name
Sodium Perborate

### Usage

Sodium perborate is primarily used as a mild antiseptic and disinfectant.  Its applications stem from its ability to release hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water. This hydrogen peroxide then acts as the active agent, killing bacteria and other microorganisms.  Common uses include:

* **Mouthwash:**  A freshly prepared, dilute solution is used as a mouthwash to help reduce oral bacteria and freshen breath.  It's important to note that this is a temporary measure and does not replace proper oral hygiene.
* **Wound cleansing:**  In some instances, dilute solutions may be used to cleanse minor wounds, although this practice is becoming less common due to the availability of more effective and specialized wound treatments.
* **Tooth whitening:**  Sodium perborate has been incorporated into some tooth whitening products due to its mild bleaching properties.  However, its effectiveness in this application is debatable and professional whitening methods are generally preferred.
* **Laundry additive (historical):**  Historically, it was sometimes added to laundry detergents to boost cleaning power by providing an oxygen bleach effect. However, its use in modern laundry detergents is less frequent due to concerns about its potential environmental impact.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the intended use and the concentration of the solution being prepared.  There is no standardized dosage for medicinal use as it's not a prescribed pharmaceutical drug in most instances.  **Always follow the instructions on any product containing sodium perborate.**  Improperly high concentrations can cause irritation. For mouthwash use, a very dilute solution is typically recommended.  For wound cleansing, again a very dilute solution is usually advised and only for superficial, minor wounds.  **Never ingest sodium perborate.**

### Side Effects

* **Irritation:**  The most common side effect is irritation of the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. This is more likely to occur with high concentrations or prolonged contact.
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, allergic reactions, such as rash or itching, may occur.
* **Hydrogen peroxide side effects:** As sodium perborate breaks down into hydrogen peroxide, side effects associated with hydrogen peroxide, such as blistering or burning, may occur in some individuals, particularly in the case of high concentration solutions applied to sensitive areas.

**If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.**


### How it Works

Sodium perborate acts as a source of active oxygen. When it dissolves in water, it slowly releases hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂).  Hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidizing agent.  This means it readily reacts with and destroys the cellular components of microorganisms like bacteria and fungi, effectively killing them.  The borate ion (from the breakdown of sodium perborate) generally has minimal direct antimicrobial action but acts as a carrier and buffer system.

### Precautions

* **Avoid contact with eyes:** Sodium perborate solutions can irritate the eyes.  Rinse thoroughly with water if contact occurs.
* **Skin sensitivity:** Individuals with sensitive skin should use it cautiously and test a small area first.
* **Ingestion:**  Never ingest sodium perborate.
* **Interaction with other substances:**  While not extensively studied, potential interactions with other chemicals are possible. Avoid mixing with strong acids or reducing agents.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  There is limited information on the safety of sodium perborate during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is best to consult a doctor before using it if pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children:**  Keep out of reach of children.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is sodium perborate safe for everyday use?**
    * **A:**  In dilute solutions and for its intended uses (like a very diluted mouthwash), it is generally considered safe for short-term use. However, it's crucial to avoid high concentrations and prolonged exposure.

* **Q: How should I store sodium perborate?**
    * **A:** Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I use sodium perborate to treat serious wounds or infections?**
    * **A:** No.  For serious wounds or infections, seek professional medical attention. Sodium perborate is not a substitute for proper medical care.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally swallow sodium perborate?**
    * **A:**  Contact a poison control center or seek immediate medical attention.
