# Suplatast
### Generic Name
Suplatast Tosilate

### Usage
Suplatast tosilate is a medication primarily used to manage allergic inflammation, particularly in the context of bronchial asthma.  It works by modulating the immune response, specifically targeting the Th2 pathway which plays a significant role in allergic reactions.  While not approved in the United States, it has seen use in Japan for conditions like interstitial cystitis and chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.  It's also been used in the treatment of Kimura's disease, although further research is needed to fully establish its efficacy in this area.  Its main application remains as a controller medication for bronchial asthma, helping to prevent asthma attacks and reduce the severity of symptoms.

### How it Works
Suplatast tosilate acts as an immunomodulator. It doesn't directly suppress the immune system, but rather it works by adjusting the balance of the immune response, particularly by inhibiting the Th2 immune response. This Th2 response is central to the development of many allergic reactions, including those associated with bronchial asthma. By suppressing the production of IgE antibodies and related inflammatory mediators like cytokines and eosinophils, suplatast helps to reduce the allergic inflammation in the airways, making it easier to breathe and preventing asthma attacks.
