# Saccharomyces Cerevisiae
### Generic Name
Saccharomyces Cerevisiae

### Usage

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as brewer's yeast, is used primarily as a nutritional supplement, providing sources of vitamins, particularly B vitamins, as well as minerals like selenium and chromium.  While not a conventional medicine in the sense of treating specific diseases, it's employed in several contexts:

* **Treatment of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections:**  Some studies suggest that *S. cerevisiae* may offer some benefit in reducing the duration or severity of upper respiratory tract infections, although more robust research is needed.  The mechanism isn't fully understood but may relate to its immune-modulating properties.

* **Relief of Constipation:**  It's been used as a gentle laxative, particularly in individuals experiencing cancer-related constipation.  The yeast's bulk-forming properties may contribute to this effect.

* **Management of Acute Diarrhea:**  There is limited evidence suggesting potential benefit in reducing the symptoms of acute diarrhea.  Again, the mechanisms are not definitively established.

* **Vitamin B Deficiency:**  *S. cerevisiae* is a good source of several B vitamins and can be a helpful supplement in individuals with deficiencies, though it's crucial to address the underlying cause of deficiency under medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use and the form of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* used (e.g., tablets, fresh baker's yeast).  There's a lack of standardized dosing across all applications, and the information below should not be considered a prescription.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations:

* **Upper Respiratory Tract Infections:**  Studies have employed dosages of 500 mg daily for periods of up to 12 weeks.

* **Laxative (Constipation):**  Doses of 6-50 grams of fresh baker's yeast have been used over a three-day period in specific contexts like cancer-related constipation, under strict medical supervision.

* **Acute Diarrhea:**  500 mg daily has been suggested.

* **Vitamin B Deficiency:** Typical supplement recommendations might suggest 2-3 tablets three times daily, but this varies greatly based on the specific product's formulation and the severity of the deficiency.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Flatulence (gas)
* Mild gastrointestinal discomfort

Serious side effects are rare but should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

The mechanisms of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*'s effects are not fully elucidated in all its uses. In the case of its nutritional benefits, it directly provides essential vitamins and minerals.  Its purported effects on the immune system and gastrointestinal tract are areas of ongoing research.  The laxative effect likely stems from its bulk-forming nature in the gut.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* is contraindicated in individuals with Crohn's disease and those currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with MAOIs are a significant concern.  Consult your physician or pharmacist before using *S. cerevisiae* if you are on any other medications.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe in moderation, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* supplements.

* **Children:**  Use in children should only occur under the guidance and supervision of a pediatrician.

* **Allergies:** Individuals with yeast allergies should strictly avoid *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
