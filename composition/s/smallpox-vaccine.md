# Smallpox Vaccine
### Generic Name
Smallpox Vaccine

### Usage
The smallpox vaccine is used for active immunization against smallpox disease.  Its primary use is to prevent smallpox infection in individuals deemed to be at high risk. This is typically determined by public health officials based on factors such as exposure to the virus or the potential for a bioterrorism event. While not a routine vaccination in most parts of the world due to smallpox eradication, it might be considered in specific high-risk scenarios.

### Dosage
The smallpox vaccine is administered only via the percutaneous route (scarification).  It is *not* given as an intramuscular, intradermal, intravenous, or subcutaneous injection.

**Adults and Adolescents ≥16 years:** A single drop of the vaccine suspension is used, with 15 needle punctures made using a bifurcated needle into the superficial skin. If a major cutaneous reaction (a vesicular or pustular lesion, or an area of palpable induration) isn't observed by days 6-8, a second dose from a different vial may be given.  Booster doses every 3 years are recommended for individuals with continued high risk of smallpox infection.

**Children <16 years (Emergency situations only):**  The dosage is the same as for adults.  However, it's crucial to note that use in children under 16 is generally limited to emergency situations due to potential risks.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Lymph node pain, headache, fatigue, malaise, feeling hot, rigors
* Dermatologic: Injection-site pruritus (itching), erythema (redness), skin rash
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, diarrhea
* Local: Erythema at injection site, pain at injection site, swelling at injection site
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Other: Decreased exercise tolerance


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (frequency not specified):**

* Nervous system: Bell's palsy, brain disease, dizziness, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningitis, paresthesia, seizure, vertigo
* Cardiovascular: Cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, myocarditis, pericarditis
* Dermatologic: Contact dermatitis, eczema vaccinatum, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, toothache
* Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction
* Infection: Secondary infection (including autoinoculation to various body areas), vaccinia (generalized, ocular, progressive, skin infection)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Myelitis
* Ophthalmic: Blindness, corneal injury (scarring), keratitis, photophobia
* Other: Fever, Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), dyspnea (shortness of breath), arthralgia (joint pain), back pain

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
The smallpox vaccine uses a live, attenuated vaccinia virus.  Vaccinia virus is closely related to the variola virus (which causes smallpox).  By inducing a localized infection with the vaccinia virus, the body develops immunity to both vaccinia and variola.  This immunity is achieved through viral replication, the production of neutralizing antibodies, and the development of cellular hypersensitivity.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Severe immune deficiency (e.g., those undergoing bone marrow transplant or with primary/acquired immunodeficiency requiring isolation)

**Warnings and Increased Risk:**

* Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions
* Encephalitis
* Myopericarditis
* Ocular complications
* Skin and systemic reactions
* Syncope (fainting)

**Use with Caution:** In patients with cardiovascular disease, acute illness,  pregnant women (Category D pregnancy risk), and breastfeeding women (contraindicated except in emergencies).  Individuals with eczema, eye disease treated with topical steroids, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency disorders (including those on immunosuppressants), and infants under 12 months are at increased risk of serious complications.  The vaccine can be transmitted to close contacts.

**Drug Interactions:** The smallpox vaccine interacts with various immunosuppressants, including azathioprine, corticosteroids, daclizumab, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, immune globulins, leflunomide, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and venetoclax. It also interacts with live vaccines and may affect the results of tuberculin tests.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is the smallpox vaccine administered?** A:  It's administered percutaneously via scarification (multiple-puncture technique) only.  It is not injected.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.

* **Q: How long does immunity last after vaccination?** A:  The duration of immunity varies, and booster doses may be needed, especially for individuals at high risk.

* **Q: Is the smallpox vaccine safe?** A:  While generally safe and effective, there are potential risks and serious side effects, particularly for certain individuals.  The benefits must be weighed against these risks.

* **Q: Can I get smallpox from the vaccine?** A: Although rare, there’s a possibility of getting a localized infection at the vaccination site.  The virus can also be transmitted to close contacts.  Proper hygiene and precautions are essential.

* **Q:  How should the vaccine be stored?** A:  Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper storage, which usually involve refrigeration at specific temperatures.
