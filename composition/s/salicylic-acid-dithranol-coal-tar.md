# Salicylic Acid + Dithranol + Coal Tar
### Generic Name
Salicylic Acid + Dithranol + Coal Tar Topical Combination

**Note:** This combination is not a single FDA-approved generic drug with a specific brand name. Instead, it represents a topical formulation where these three active ingredients are combined.  The precise ratios of each ingredient can vary significantly between different manufacturer's preparations.  Always check the specific product label for the exact composition and instructions.


### Usage

This topical combination is primarily used to treat psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, scaly, itchy patches.  The combination leverages the individual properties of each ingredient to offer a multifaceted approach to managing psoriasis symptoms:

* **Salicylic acid:** Acts as a keratolytic agent, meaning it helps to soften and shed the thickened, scaly skin characteristic of psoriasis.  This improves skin texture and allows for better penetration of the other active ingredients.

* **Dithranol (Anthralin):** A potent anti-psoriatic agent that slows down the rapid skin cell turnover associated with psoriasis.  It's believed to reduce inflammation and the formation of psoriatic plaques.

* **Coal Tar:** Also possesses anti-inflammatory and keratolytic properties. It helps to reduce scaling, itching, and redness associated with psoriasis. It may also have some immunomodulatory effects.

While primarily used for psoriasis, this combination may sometimes be considered for other conditions involving scaly, thickened skin under the guidance of a dermatologist. However, this is not a standard or widely accepted use.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions are highly variable and **completely dependent on the specific formulation and the prescribing physician's recommendations**.  There is no standardized dosage across all preparations containing this combination.  The strength of each active ingredient, application frequency, and treatment duration will be tailored to the individual patient's needs and response to therapy.

Generally, the cream or ointment is applied to the affected areas of the skin, typically once or twice daily, as directed by a doctor. The application site and treatment duration will be determined by the severity of the psoriasis.


**Children and Older Adults:** Use in children and older adults requires careful monitoring and dosage adjustment based on the individual's condition and response. The product should only be used as directed by a physician who can assess the risks and benefits of the treatment.  Use in children is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a dermatologist.


**Oral and IV administration:** This medication is for topical use only.  Oral or intravenous administration is not applicable.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Skin irritation (burning, stinging, redness)
* Dryness or scaling of the skin
* Itching
* Staining of the skin (especially with dithranol and coal tar)
* Hair discoloration


Less common but serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Contact dermatitis (inflammation of the skin)
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)


**Important:** If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

This combination works by synergistically combining the effects of its three active ingredients:

* **Salicylic acid** softens and removes thickened skin, facilitating the penetration of dithranol and coal tar.
* **Dithranol** inhibits the rapid growth of skin cells, reducing inflammation and plaque formation.
* **Coal tar** possesses anti-inflammatory and keratolytic properties, further aiding in reducing scaling, itching, and redness.  The exact mechanisms of action of coal tar are not fully understood, but it appears to influence immune responses in the skin.

Together, these ingredients address several aspects of psoriasis, resulting in improved skin clarity and reduced inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should not be used on individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to any of its components (salicylic acid, dithranol, or coal tar).
* **Drug Interactions:** There are limited reports of significant interactions with other medications.  However, it's essential to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Sunlight Exposure:** Coal tar and dithranol can increase sensitivity to sunlight.  Avoid prolonged sun exposure and use sunscreen when outdoors.
* **Avoid Contact with Eyes and Mucous Membranes:**  Accidental contact can cause irritation. Rinse thoroughly with water if contact occurs.
* **Children and Older Adults:** Use with caution in these populations. The dosage needs to be adjusted based on the patientâ€™s tolerance.
