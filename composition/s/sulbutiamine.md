# Sulbutiamine
### Generic Name
Sulbutiamine

### Usage
Sulbutiamine is primarily used as an energy booster to combat fatigue and asthenia (general weakness or debilitation).  While research is ongoing and limited, it has also shown potential benefits in improving memory and stimulating appetite.  It's important to note that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has included Sulbutiamine on its dietary supplement ingredient advisory list, indicating that its use as a dietary supplement ingredient may not be lawful.  Therefore, its use should be under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The therapeutic dose typically ranges from 400-1000 mg per day for adults, divided into two doses (morning and midday). For elderly patients, a lower dose of 200 mg might be recommended.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will depend on the individual's condition and response to the medication, as determined by a healthcare professional.

**Children:** Sulbutiamine should be avoided in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare provider should always be consulted before using this medication in individuals with these conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Diarrhea
* Epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen)
* Mild agitation
* Skin rash
* Headache
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Nausea
* Tremor
* Vomiting

While less common, more serious side effects are possible.  If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works
Sulbutiamine is a fat-soluble derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1).  Its nootropic effects (cognitive enhancement) are believed to be due to its actions on the dopamine, glutamatergic, and cholinergic systems in the brain.  Its lipophilic nature allows it to readily cross the blood-brain barrier, where it exerts its effects.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Sulbutiamine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to sulbutiamine or any of its components.  It should also be avoided in children.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Sulbutiamine should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Drug Interactions:** While specific interactions are not extensively documented, it is essential to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking before starting sulbutiamine.  This is to prevent potential interactions.

**Other Precautions:**  Because of its limited research and the FDA advisory, use should be guided by a physician.  Close monitoring for adverse effects is necessary.
