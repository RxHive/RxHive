# Selenous Acid
### Generic Name
Selenous Acid

### Usage
Selenous acid is primarily used as a source of selenium in parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions.  Parenteral nutrition is a method of supplying nutrients intravenously, used when a patient cannot obtain adequate nutrition through oral or enteral (feeding tube) means.  It's crucial for patients who are unable to consume food due to various medical conditions.  The selenium provided by selenous acid is essential for the proper function of several enzymes and plays a vital role in various bodily processes.  


### Dosage

**Parenteral Nutrition (PN) - Intravenous Administration:** Selenous acid is *not* for direct IV infusion; it must be added to a PN solution.

* **Adults:** The general recommendation is 60 mcg/day added to the PN solution.  However, higher doses may be necessary depending on individual patient needs and clinical circumstances. The dose should be tailored to the patient's specific nutritional requirements and any selenium intake from other sources.  Severe fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base imbalances should be corrected before administering the PN solution.

* **Children:**
    * Infants and children weighing less than 7 kg: 2-4 mcg/kg/day added to the PN solution.
    * Children weighing more than 7 kg: 2 mcg/kg/day added to PN, not exceeding 60 mcg/day.  Again, dosage should be adjusted based on individual needs and other selenium sources.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Pregnant women have increased selenium needs.  Parenteral nutrition with selenium should be considered if oral or enteral intake is insufficient. Selenium is excreted in breast milk; however, administering the recommended dose is not expected to harm the breastfed infant.


### Side Effects

* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) due to precipitates in pulmonary vessels.
* Aluminum toxicity (selenous acid preparations contain aluminum).
* Vein damage
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)

Note: This list may not be exhaustive.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Selenous acid is metabolized in the body to hydrogen selenide.  Hydrogen selenide acts as a selenium source, forming selenoproteins. These proteins are vital enzymes involved in various biological functions, including antioxidant defense (glutathione peroxidase), hormone metabolism (iodothyronine deiodinase), and other cellular processes.  By providing selenium, selenous acid supports the production of these crucial selenoproteins.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress.
* **Aluminum Toxicity:** Selenous acid preparations contain aluminum, which can be toxic.
* **Drug Interactions:** Selenous acid may interfere with the absorption of certain medications (e.g., baloxavir marboxil, bictegravir, bisphosphonates, eltrombopag, and penicillamine).
* **Administration:** Selenous acid is *not* for direct IV injection. It must be added to a PN solution.  Solutions with osmolarity exceeding 900 mOsm/L require administration through a central catheter.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of selenium levels, blood cell counts, coagulation parameters, fluid and electrolyte balance, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, and liver and kidney function is recommended during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take selenous acid orally?** A: No, selenous acid is for intravenous administration only as part of a parenteral nutrition solution. It is not meant for oral ingestion.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop the infusion immediately and contact your healthcare provider.

* **Q: How is selenous acid stored?** A: Follow the manufacturer's storage instructions precisely.  Typically, this involves refrigeration.

* **Q: Is selenous acid suitable for everyone needing parenteral nutrition?** A: No, the decision to use selenous acid in PN is made on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional, taking into account the patient's overall health and nutritional needs.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of selenous acid administration?** A: Long-term effects depend on the individual, dosage, and duration of treatment.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is vital.
