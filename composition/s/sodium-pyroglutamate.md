# Sodium Pyroglutamate
### Generic Name
Sodium Pyroglutamate (also known as Sodium Pidolate)

### Usage
Sodium pyroglutamate is primarily used as a topical humectant in creams and lotions.  Its main application is in treating dry skin conditions by improving skin hydration and moisture retention.  It's often included as one ingredient among several in skincare products formulated to address dryness, roughness, and related symptoms.  While not a treatment for specific skin diseases, it helps alleviate the dryness associated with various skin conditions.  It is not typically used alone for therapeutic purposes, but rather as a component within a broader skincare regimen.

### Dosage
There's no standard dosage for sodium pyroglutamate as it's not prescribed as a standalone medication.  The concentration of sodium pyroglutamate in topical products varies depending on the formulation and the manufacturer.  Dosage information is found on the product label and will indicate the appropriate amount to apply to the affected area, usually a thin layer as directed.  No specific pediatric or geriatric dosage adjustments are typically required, but always follow the product instructions carefully.  For example, for a cream, the instructions might read to use a pea-sized amount for the face twice daily. For larger areas, apply a proportionally larger amount.


### Side Effects
Sodium pyroglutamate is generally well-tolerated and considered non-irritating.  However, individual reactions can vary.  Possible side effects, though rare, may include:

* Mild redness or irritation at the application site.
* Allergic reactions (rare, requiring immediate discontinuation of use and consultation with a healthcare provider).

Serious side effects are uncommon with topical application of sodium pyroglutamate at typical concentrations. If any unusual or severe reactions occur, discontinue use and seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works
Sodium pyroglutamate functions as a humectant.  Humectants attract and retain moisture.  Applied topically, it draws water from the surrounding environment (in humid conditions) or from deeper skin layers to the skin's surface. This increases the skin's hydration level, leading to softer, smoother, and less dry skin.  The mechanism involves hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups in sodium pyroglutamate and water molecules.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to pyroglutamic acid or other components in the product should avoid using it.
* **Open Wounds:** Avoid applying to broken skin or open wounds.
* **Eye Contact:** Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.

* **Sensitivity:** If irritation or allergic reactions occur, discontinue use immediately.
