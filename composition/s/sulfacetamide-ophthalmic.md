# Sulfacetamide (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Sulfacetamide (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Sulfacetamide ophthalmic is a sulfonamide antibiotic primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) and trachoma.  Bacterial conjunctivitis is a common eye infection causing redness, irritation, and discharge. Trachoma is a chronic, infectious disease of the eye, often leading to blindness if left untreated.  While primarily used for bacterial infections of the eye's surface, it's crucial to remember that a doctor must diagnose the cause of the eye problem before treatment begins.  Sulfacetamide is only effective against bacterial infections; it won't work for viral or fungal eye infections.

### Dosage

**Bacterial Conjunctivitis and Other Superficial Ocular Infections:**

* **Adults and Children (≥2 months):**
    * **10% Solution:**  Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2-3 hours for 7-10 days.
    * **10% Ointment:** Apply a small amount (about ½ inch ribbon) into the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours and at bedtime for 7-10 days.  The ointment can be used alongside the solution.
    *  The dosage should be tapered (increased time between doses) as the infection improves.  Never stop treatment prematurely without consulting your doctor.


**Trachoma:**

* **Adults and Children (≥2 months):**
    * **10% Solution:** Instill 2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2 hours.  Trachoma treatment *must* include systemic therapy (oral medication) in addition to the topical sulfacetamide.


**Important Administration Notes:**

* Avoid touching the tip of the container to any surface.
* When using the solution, apply gentle pressure to the lacrimal sac (inner corner of the eye) for 1-2 minutes after instillation to minimize systemic absorption.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Burning, stinging, or irritation of the eye; redness of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the eyelid and eye).
* **Less Common, but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (including hypersensitivity reactions), eye pain, corneal ulceration, and blurred vision.  Rare but serious systemic side effects (affecting the whole body)  can include blood disorders and skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual side effects.**

### How it Works

Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic. It works by interfering with the production of folic acid, a vital nutrient for bacterial growth. By inhibiting folic acid synthesis, sulfacetamide prevents the bacteria from multiplying and allows the body's immune system to clear the infection.  The ophthalmic (eye) formulation is specifically designed for local action, targeting bacteria on the surface of the eye.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use sulfacetamide if you have a known allergy to sulfacetamide or other sulfonamide antibiotics.
* **Drug Interactions:** Sulfacetamide's effectiveness may be reduced when used with certain medications, including some local anesthetics and 4-aminobenzoic acid. Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sulfacetamide is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully known.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under a doctor's supervision.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown and use while breastfeeding is generally not recommended.
* **Other Precautions:**  Avoid using sulfacetamide concurrently with silver preparations.  If you wear contact lenses, remove them before applying the medication and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for sulfacetamide to work?**  A: Improvement usually begins within a few days, but the full course of treatment should be completed to prevent recurrence.

* **Q: Can I use sulfacetamide for a viral eye infection?** A: No. Sulfacetamide only works against bacterial infections.  Viral conjunctivitis requires a different treatment approach.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store sulfacetamide?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q:  Can I share my sulfacetamide with someone else?** A: No.  Antibiotics should only be used for the individual they are prescribed to.
