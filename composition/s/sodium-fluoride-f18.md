# Sodium Fluoride F18
### Generic Name
Sodium Fluoride F18

### Usage
Sodium Fluoride F18 is a radioactive tracer used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.  Its primary use is in skeletal imaging to detect areas of increased bone turnover. This is helpful in diagnosing and monitoring various bone conditions.  While its primary application is in skeletal imaging, it's important to note that it's not used for therapeutic purposes; it's solely a diagnostic tool.


### Dosage
**Skeletal Imaging:**

* **Adults:**  The typical intravenous (IV) dose is 8-12 mCi (300-450 MBq).
* **Children:**  Weight-based dosing is typically used, ranging from 0.5-4 mCi (19-148 MBq), calculated at 0.06 mCi/kg (2.1 MBq/kg).  The precise dose will be determined by a physician based on the child's weight and the specific clinical situation.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a physician for appropriate dosage in patients with impaired organ function.

The medication is administered intravenously by trained medical professionals.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by the nuclear medicine physician or technologist administering the dose.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are not frequently reported and may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Muscle tremors
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

While rare, more serious side effects associated with radiation exposure are possible.  It's crucial to report any unusual symptoms to your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Sodium Fluoride F18 is a radioactive isotope of fluoride.  The body metabolizes fluoride similarly to calcium.  Areas of increased bone formation or metabolic activity, such as those seen in bone tumors, fractures, or infections, will take up more of the radioactive fluoride.  This increased uptake is then detected by the PET scanner, producing images that help identify areas of abnormal bone activity.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sodium Fluoride F18 is categorized as Pregnancy Category B, meaning that animal studies have not demonstrated fetal risk, but there are no adequate human studies. However, all radiopharmaceuticals pose a potential risk to the fetus.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before undergoing this procedure. Breastfeeding may need to be interrupted for at least 24 hours after administration.
* **Pediatric Use:** Use in pediatric patients requires careful consideration of the radiation dose. Doses are adjusted based on weight.
* **Radiation Exposure:** Sodium Fluoride F18 is radioactive.  Appropriate safety precautions must be followed by healthcare professionals during handling, administration, and disposal of the medication to minimize radiation exposure to both patients and staff.  Patients should follow instructions regarding fluid intake to help flush the radioactive material from their system.
* **Other Medications:** No specific drug interactions are prominently listed in the available information. However, it's always advisable to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, before undergoing a PET scan.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the scan take?** A: The PET scan usually begins 1-2 hours after injection of Sodium Fluoride F18 and takes approximately 30-60 minutes.

* **Q: What should I do after the injection?** A: Drink at least 500 mL of fluids before and after the injection and void frequently to help minimize radiation exposure to the bladder.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: While the radiation exposure is carefully controlled, there's always a small risk of long-term effects from radiation exposure.  Your physician will discuss this with you.

* **Q:  Will I be radioactive after the scan?** A: Yes, but the amount of radioactivity is relatively low and decreases significantly within a short time.  Follow the instructions given by your healthcare provider regarding safety measures.

* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: Storage and handling are strictly controlled by healthcare facilities due to the radioactive nature of Sodium Fluoride F18.
