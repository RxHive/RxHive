# Sulpiride
### Generic Name
Sulpiride

### Usage

Sulpiride is primarily used to treat schizophrenia, both in its acute and chronic forms.  It's considered an atypical antipsychotic, meaning it works differently than older antipsychotic medications.  While its main use is in schizophrenia, sulpiride also has a secondary, short-term role in managing anxiety in cases where standard treatments have proven ineffective.  In children over six years old, it may be used to treat severe behavioral disorders, particularly agitation and self-harm behaviors, especially in those with autism.  It's important to note that the use of sulpiride in children should only be under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to the medication.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia:** Oral dosages typically start at 200-400 mg twice daily (BID), often taken in the morning and early evening. The maintenance dose can range from 400-1200 mg BID, adjusted based on the individual's response and symptom profile (positive, negative, or mixed). Intramuscular (IM) administration is also possible, usually ranging from 200-800 mg per day.
* **Anxiety (short-term):** Oral doses are much lower, typically 50-150 mg daily for a limited period, usually no more than approximately four weeks.


**Children:**

* **Schizophrenia (14 years and older):**  The dosage is generally the same as for adults, under strict medical supervision.
* **Severe behavioral disorders (over 6 years):**  The dose is usually calculated based on body weight, typically 5-10 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired kidney or liver function.  Consult your doctor for specific guidance in these situations.

### How it Works

Sulpiride is classified as a benzamide atypical antipsychotic.  Its primary mechanism involves blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, particularly the D2 receptors.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter implicated in several psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. By blocking dopamine activity, sulpiride helps reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions.  It also has some effect on negative symptoms, though less pronounced than on positive symptoms.  The atypical nature of sulpiride means it generally shows less affinity for other receptors in the brain compared to older, typical antipsychotics, potentially reducing the incidence of some side effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sulpiride is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, pheochromocytoma (tumor of the adrenal gland), acute porphyria (a genetic disorder affecting heme synthesis), prolactin-dependent tumors, severe renal or hepatic impairment, severe hematologic disorders, and concurrent use of certain medications.

* **Drug Interactions:** Sulpiride can interact with several other medications, including those affecting heart rhythm, blood pressure, and central nervous system function. It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sulpiride crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.  It's generally not recommended during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.  Risks to the developing fetus and infant should be carefully considered.

* **Specific Populations:**  Extra caution should be exercised when using sulpiride in elderly patients, individuals with diabetes or other metabolic disorders, those with liver or kidney problems, patients with cardiovascular disease, and those with a history of seizures or other neurological conditions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Sulpiride with food?** A: Sulpiride can usually be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Sulpiride?** A: Store Sulpiride as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Sulpiride suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking Sulpiride abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce the dosage if needed.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Sulpiride?** A: It's strongly advised to avoid alcohol while taking Sulpiride, as it can increase the risk of sedation and other side effects.
