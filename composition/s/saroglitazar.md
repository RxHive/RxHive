# Saroglitazar
### Generic Name
Saroglitazar

### Usage
Saroglitazar is a medication used to treat diabetic dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's specifically indicated for those whose condition isn't adequately controlled with statin therapy alone.  Diabetic dyslipidemia refers to abnormal levels of lipids (fats) in the blood, a common complication of type 2 diabetes,  while hypertriglyceridemia specifically signifies elevated triglyceride levels.  Saroglitazar helps manage these lipid abnormalities, contributing to better overall diabetes management.


### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes is 4 mg once daily (OD) by mouth.  There is no established dosage for children, and the safety and efficacy in pediatric populations haven't been determined.  Dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specifically recommended by the manufacturer; however, caution is advised in these patient groups. The medication can be taken with or without food, though taking it with food may minimize potential stomach upset.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 2% of patients) include fever, asthenia (weakness or fatigue), and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining).  While less frequent, serious side effects are possible and necessitate immediate medical attention.  Always consult a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works
Saroglitazar is a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist.  This means it activates both PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma receptors.  By activating PPAR-alpha, it increases the liver's ability to break down fatty acids, reducing triglyceride production and secretion.  This leads to lower triglyceride levels in the blood.  The activation of PPAR-gamma improves insulin sensitivity, aiding in better blood sugar control.  Therefore, Saroglitazar works on multiple fronts to address the lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance characteristic of diabetic dyslipidemia.


### Precautions
Saroglitazar is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to the drug or any of its components.  It should be used cautiously in patients with abnormal liver or kidney function, a history of muscle disorders (myopathies), type 2 diabetes complicated by cardiac disease with episodes of congestive heart failure, and in older adults.  The drug is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully known, and breastfeeding while using Saroglitazar is not recommended.  Patients should inform their healthcare provider about all other medications they are taking to check for potential drug interactions.
