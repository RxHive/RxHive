# S-Amlodipine + S-Metoprolol Tartrate
### Generic Name
S-Amlodipine + S-Metoprolol Tartrate

### Usage
This combination medication contains two active ingredients: S-amlodipine and S-metoprolol tartrate.  It's primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  S-amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood. S-metoprolol tartrate is a beta-blocker that slows down the heart rate and reduces the force of heart contractions, both of which contribute to lowering blood pressure.  By combining these two, the medication provides a more comprehensive approach to blood pressure management than either drug alone. While primarily for hypertension, it might be considered in certain cases for managing symptoms associated with angina (chest pain) when high blood pressure is a contributing factor.  However, it's crucial to remember this combination should only be used under the strict guidance of a physician; it is not a first-line treatment for angina.


### Dosage
Dosage of S-Amlodipine + S-Metoprolol Tartrate is highly individualized and determined by a physician based on factors like the patient's age, weight, overall health, and response to the medication. There is no single standard dosage.  It's typically available in tablet form for oral administration.  The doctor will start with a low dose and adjust it as needed.  Dosage information found online should not be used to self-medicate;  always follow your doctor's instructions.  This combination is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Children's use of this combination is not generally recommended.



### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Swelling in ankles or feet
* Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
* Lightheadedness
* Weakness

Less common, but more serious side effects warrant immediate medical attention and include:

* Chest pain
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
* Shortness of breath
* Severe allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver problems (jaundice, abdominal pain)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
S-Amlodipine and S-metoprolol tartrate work through different mechanisms to lower blood pressure:

* **S-Amlodipine:** This calcium channel blocker relaxes and widens blood vessels.  By reducing the resistance to blood flow, the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood, leading to lower blood pressure.

* **S-Metoprolol Tartrate:** This beta-blocker reduces the heart's workload by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of its contractions. This also contributes to lower blood pressure.

The combination of these two effects provides a synergistic approach to blood pressure management, often resulting in better control than either drug used individually.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is not suitable for individuals with certain conditions, including severe bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart block, cardiogenic shock, and certain types of heart failure.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss this medication with their doctor as it may present risks.


* **Drug Interactions:** S-Amlodipine + S-Metoprolol Tartrate can interact with several other medications, including other heart medications, some antidepressants, and certain antifungals.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Specific Warnings:**  Older adults and individuals with kidney or liver problems might require dosage adjustments due to increased risk of side effects.  Alcohol consumption should be moderated as it can potentially interact with the medication and worsen side effects.  Sudden discontinuation of this medication can be dangerous and should only be done under the strict supervision of a physician.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication if I feel better?**  A: No, never stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor. Sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure and other adverse effects.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.


* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as instructed on the label.
