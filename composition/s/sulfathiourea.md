# Sulfathiourea
### Generic Name
Sulfathiourea

### Usage

Sulfathiourea is a sulfonamide antibiotic, primarily used to treat bacterial infections susceptible to its effects.  However, its use has significantly declined due to the rise of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and the availability of newer, more effective, and safer antibiotics.  It's crucial to understand that sulfathiourea is not a first-line treatment for most bacterial infections.  Its use is largely restricted to situations where other antibiotics have failed or are contraindicated, and only under the strict supervision of a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage of sulfathiourea varies greatly depending on the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, and overall health, and the severity of the infection.  There is no standardized, widely accepted dosage regimen due to its limited current use.  **It is absolutely vital to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage.**  Self-medication with sulfathiourea is dangerous and strongly discouraged.  The medication may be available in tablet, syrup, or injection form, but the method of administration would again be determined by the physician based on the individual needs of the patient.


### Side Effects

Sulfathiourea, like other sulfonamides, can cause several side effects, some common and others more serious but less frequent.  

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache, dizziness.
* **Serious Side Effects (Less Common but Requiring Immediate Medical Attention):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), blood disorders (agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia), kidney damage (renal toxicity), liver damage, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), exfoliative dermatitis.


**If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as serious, seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Sulfathiourea works by inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria. Folic acid is essential for bacterial growth and reproduction.  Sulfathiourea competitively inhibits the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase, which is responsible for incorporating para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) into dihydrofolic acid, a precursor to folic acid. By blocking this step, sulfathiourea prevents the bacteria from producing the necessary folic acid, leading to impaired bacterial growth and ultimately, bacterial cell death.  Importantly, humans obtain folic acid through their diet and do not rely on the same synthesis pathway as bacteria; this is why sulfathiourea can target bacterial cells without significantly affecting human cells, though adverse effects are still possible.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Individuals with a known allergy to sulfonamides should absolutely avoid sulfathiourea.
* **Drug Interactions:** Sulfathiourea can interact with numerous other medications, potentially leading to adverse effects.  Complete disclosure of all medications (prescription and over-the-counter) to a physician is essential before taking this antibiotic.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:** Patients with impaired kidney or liver function should use sulfathiourea with extreme caution, as it may be more likely to cause adverse effects. Close monitoring is required.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of sulfathiourea during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally avoided due to the potential risks to the mother and child.  A physician should assess the risk-benefit ratio carefully.
* **Older Adults and Children:**  Older adults and children may be more susceptible to the side effects of sulfathiourea.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary, and careful monitoring is crucial.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store sulfathiourea?** A: Store sulfathiourea as directed on the prescription label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can I stop taking sulfathiourea when I feel better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the full course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early can lead to antibiotic resistance and incomplete treatment of the infection.
* **Q: Is sulfathiourea safe for long-term use?** A: No, sulfathiourea is not intended for long-term use and should only be taken as directed and for the prescribed duration.  Prolonged use increases the risk of developing serious side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.  Contact your physician if you have concerns about missed doses.
* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A: Signs of a serious allergic reaction include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, hives, and severe skin rash. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.
