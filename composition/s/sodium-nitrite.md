# Sodium Nitrite
### Generic Name
Sodium Nitrite

### Usage

Sodium nitrite is used as an antidote, specifically in the treatment of life-threatening acute cyanide poisoning. It's crucial to understand that sodium nitrite is not a standalone treatment; it's used sequentially with sodium thiosulfate.  This combination works synergistically to counteract the effects of cyanide.  Sodium nitrite's primary role is to convert a portion of the body's hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Methemoglobin then binds to cyanide, forming a less toxic complex that can be eliminated from the body. Sodium thiosulfate then helps in the detoxification process by providing sulfur to convert cyanide to thiocyanate, which is readily excreted by the kidneys.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Acute Cyanide Poisoning):**  Administered intravenously (IV).

*   10 mL (300 mg) of sodium nitrite is infused at a rate of 2.5–5 mL/min.  This is immediately followed by 50 mL (12.5 g) of sodium thiosulfate infused at a rate of 5 mL/min.
*   The maximum dose is 10 mL (300 mg) of sodium nitrite and 50 mL (12.5 g) of sodium thiosulfate.
*   Infusion rates should be adjusted based on the patient's blood pressure.  Lowering of blood pressure is a significant risk.
*   Close monitoring is required for 24–48 hours post-treatment.  If symptoms reappear, a repeat dose (half the original amount) may be administered.
*   Treatment should be stopped if the methemoglobin level exceeds 30%.
*   In patients who cannot tolerate high levels of methemoglobin, dosing can be adjusted based on hemoglobin levels. A starting dose would be 0.19 mL/kg of sodium nitrite and 4.5 mL/kg of sodium thiosulfate for a hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL, increasing both by 0.03 mL/kg for every 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin.

**Pediatric Dosage (Acute Cyanide Poisoning):** Administered intravenously (IV).

*   0.2 mL/kg (6 mg/kg or 6–8 mL/m² BSA) of sodium nitrite is infused at a rate of 2.5–5 mL/min, immediately followed by 1 mL/kg of sodium thiosulfate (250 mg/kg or approximately 30–40 mL/m² BSA) infused at a rate of 5 mL/min.
*   The maximum dose is 10 mL (300 mg) of sodium nitrite and 50 mL (12.5 g) of sodium thiosulfate.
*   Infusion rates should be adjusted based on the patient's blood pressure.
*   Close monitoring is required for 24–48 hours post-treatment. If symptoms reappear, a repeat dose (half the original amount) may be administered.
*   Treatment should be stopped if the methemoglobin level exceeds 30%.
*   In patients who cannot tolerate high levels of methemoglobin, dosing can be adjusted based on hemoglobin levels similar to adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment as sodium nitrite is significantly eliminated via the kidneys.

### Side Effects

*   Nervous system: Anxiety, coma, confusion, dizziness, fatigue, headache, numbness, paresthesia, seizure, tingling.
*   Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmia, flushing, hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia.
*   Ophthalmic: Blurred vision.
*   Respiratory: Cyanosis, dyspnea, tachypnea.
*   Dermatologic: Diaphoresis, urticaria.
*   Endocrine/Metabolic: Acidosis.
*   Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
*   Hematologic/Oncologic: Methemoglobinemia (a serious side effect).
*   Neuromuscular/Skeletal: Weakness.


**Serious but less frequent side effects:**  Hypotension and methemoglobinemia are potentially life-threatening.  Seek immediate medical attention if any adverse effects occur.


### How it Works

Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase, a vital enzyme in cellular respiration, leading to cellular asphyxiation. Sodium nitrite works by oxidizing a portion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Methemoglobin has a higher affinity for cyanide than cytochrome c oxidase, binding to it and forming a less toxic complex that can be excreted in the urine. This prevents cyanide from interfering with cellular respiration.  Sodium thiosulfate plays a crucial role by supplying sulfur to convert cyanide to thiocyanate, which is more easily eliminated by the kidneys.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling, however, it is contraindicated in situations where the diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is uncertain.
*   **Interactions:** Concomitant use with other methemoglobin-inducing agents (e.g., certain anesthetics, antimalarials, nitrates, sulfonamides) increases the risk of methemoglobinemia.
*   **Warnings:**  Sodium nitrite can cause serious hypotension and methemoglobinemia, potentially life-threatening.  Use with extreme caution in patients with impaired cardiac/respiratory function, anemia, G6PD deficiency, smoke inhalation injury, or carbon monoxide poisoning.  Caution is also advised in neonates, infants, geriatric patients, and patients on antihypertensive medications or diuretics.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Category C.  Sodium nitrite can cause methemoglobin formation, potentially affecting fetal hemoglobin.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How is sodium nitrite administered?** A: It is administered intravenously (IV) as a slow injection.
*   **Q: Is sodium nitrite a standalone treatment for cyanide poisoning?** A: No, it is used sequentially with sodium thiosulfate.
*   **Q: What are the most serious side effects?** A: Hypotension and methemoglobinemia are the most serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.
*   **Q: How is sodium nitrite stored?** A: Storage instructions should be obtained from the product labeling.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.
*   **Q: Can I take other medications while using sodium nitrite?** A: Discuss all medications and supplements with a healthcare professional before taking sodium nitrite.  This is especially critical given the drug interactions with other methemoglobin-forming agents.
