# Sitagliptin
### Generic Name
Sitagliptin

### Usage
Sitagliptin is primarily used to improve glycemic control (blood sugar levels) in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's used as an add-on to diet and exercise, and can be used alone or in combination with other diabetes medications.  It's not intended for use in type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, and its use in patients with a history of pancreatitis hasn't been extensively studied.  Sitagliptin helps manage blood sugar by improving how the body responds to its own insulin.

### Dosage

**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes):** The usual dose is 100 mg once daily.  This may be adjusted based on kidney function.

* **eGFR ≥ 45 mL/minute/1.73 m²:** 100 mg once daily.
* **eGFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/minute/1.73 m²:** 50 mg once daily.
* **eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m²:** 25 mg once daily.
* **End-stage renal disease (ESRD) with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis:** 25 mg once daily, regardless of dialysis timing.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of sitagliptin in children haven't been established.

**Administration:** Sitagliptin tablets are taken orally and can be taken with or without food.  The tablets should be swallowed whole; do not crush, chew, or break them.  When used with other blood sugar-lowering medications (like insulin or sulfonylureas), lower doses of those medications may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar, especially when combined with other diabetes medications)

**Less Common (frequency not specified):**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea

**Serious but Less Common (<1%):**  These are rare but require immediate medical attention.

* Acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Hepatic enzyme elevations (liver damage)
* Acute renal failure (kidney failure)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Hypersensitivity reactions


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Sitagliptin works by inhibiting an enzyme called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4).  DPP-4 breaks down incretin hormones, which are naturally produced in the body and help regulate blood sugar levels. By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases the levels of these incretin hormones, leading to:

* Increased insulin release from the pancreas when blood sugar is high.
* Decreased glucagon secretion from the pancreas (glucagon raises blood sugar).
* Improved overall blood sugar control.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sitagliptin is contraindicated in individuals with a known serious hypersensitivity (such as anaphylaxis or angioedema) to sitagliptin or any of its components.
* **Interactions:**  Sitagliptin can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Particular attention should be paid to medications that affect kidney function or blood sugar levels.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for individuals with moderate to severe kidney impairment or end-stage renal disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sitagliptin is a Category B drug during pregnancy; however, other medications are generally preferred for diabetes management in pregnancy.  It's unknown whether sitagliptin is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Heart Failure:**  Sitagliptin should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure.
* **Pancreatitis:** Use with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis.  Report any severe abdominal pain immediately.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take sitagliptin with food?**  A: Yes, sitagliptin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store sitagliptin?** A: Store sitagliptin at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking sitagliptin suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking sitagliptin without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may negatively affect your blood sugar control.
* **Q:  What if I experience low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?** A: If you experience symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., dizziness, sweating, shakiness), immediately treat with a fast-acting sugar source as directed by your healthcare provider.
* **Q:  Is sitagliptin right for me?** A: Only your doctor can determine if sitagliptin is appropriate for your specific health situation.  Discuss your medical history and current medications with them to make an informed decision.
