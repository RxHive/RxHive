# Sincalide
### Generic Name
Sincalide

### Usage
Sincalide, a cholecystokinin (CCK) analog, is primarily used in adults for several diagnostic procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.  Its main applications are:

* **Accelerating barium meal transit through the small bowel:** This speeds up the passage of barium (a contrast agent used in X-rays) through the small intestine, reducing the time needed for fluoroscopy and X-ray examination. This minimizes radiation exposure for the patient.

* **Stimulating gallbladder contraction:** Sincalide aids in visualizing the gallbladder during diagnostic imaging by causing it to contract. This helps assess gallbladder function and identify potential issues.

* **Obtaining concentrated bile samples:**  By stimulating bile flow into the duodenum, Sincalide facilitates the collection of concentrated bile for laboratory analysis. This analysis helps determine the levels of cholesterol, bile salts, phospholipids, and crystals, which are crucial for diagnosing various liver and gallbladder conditions.

* **Stimulating pancreatic secretion (often with secretin):**  When used in conjunction with secretin, another hormone, Sincalide stimulates pancreatic secretion. This allows for the collection of pancreatic fluid for detailed analysis of enzyme activity, composition, and cytology, aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic disorders.


### Dosage

Dosage of Sincalide varies depending on the intended use and the route of administration (intravenous [IV] or intramuscular [IM]).  **It's crucial to follow the healthcare provider's specific instructions.**  The following are general guidelines only:

**Adults:**

* **Barium meal transit time acceleration:**
    * IV push: 0.04 mcg/kg over 30-60 seconds, administered once the barium meal has passed the proximal jejunum. A second dose may be given after 30 minutes if needed.
    * IV infusion: 0.12 mcg/kg over 30 minutes.
* **Gallbladder contraction stimulation:**
    * IV push: 0.02 mcg/kg over 30-60 seconds. A second dose may be given after 15 minutes if needed.
    * IV infusion: 0.12 mcg/kg over 50 minutes.
    * IM: 0.1 mcg/kg
* **Pancreatic secretion stimulation:**
    * IV infusion: 0.02 mcg/kg over 30 minutes, starting 30 minutes after initiating a secretin infusion.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Sincalide in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):

* Abdominal distress
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (reported in less than 1% of patients, post-marketing, or case reports):

* Abdominal cramps
* Anaphylactic shock
* Anaphylaxis
* Bowel urgency
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Facial numbness
* Flushing
* Headache
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Loss of consciousness
* Pharyngeal edema (swelling in the throat)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Seizures
* Skin rash
* Sneezing
* Syncope (fainting)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Vomiting

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Sincalide is a synthetic analogue of cholecystokinin (CCK), a naturally occurring hormone.  When administered intravenously, it mimics the actions of CCK:

* It stimulates the gallbladder to contract, forcing bile into the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).
* It increases pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate secretion.
* It enhances intestinal motility.
* It causes pyloric contraction, slowing gastric emptying.

The combined effects of Sincalide and secretin (when used together) provide valuable information about pancreatic function through analysis of the duodenal aspirate.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sincalide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, intestinal obstruction, and certain acute abdominal conditions (e.g., acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, perforated ulcers).
* **Interactions:** Drugs affecting gallbladder function might reduce Sincalide's effectiveness.  Healthcare providers should be informed of all medications being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Sincalide is a Category C drug in pregnancy; use during pregnancy, especially near term, should be avoided due to potential risks of preterm labor or spontaneous abortion.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Precautions:** The injection solution contains sodium metabisulfite, which can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.  Patients with a history of sulfite sensitivity should exercise caution.  Monitoring for hypersensitivity reactions is crucial during and for one hour after administration.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Sincalide administered?** A: Sincalide is usually given intravenously (IV) as a push or infusion, or intramuscularly (IM) depending on the specific diagnostic test.

* **Q: How long does it take for Sincalide to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the administration route and the intended effect.

* **Q: How should Sincalide be stored?** A: Store Sincalide as directed by the manufacturer's labeling, usually at controlled room temperature.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions before using Sincalide?** A: Depending on the purpose of administration, a healthcare provider might advise on dietary restrictions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Sincalide is typically used only for specific diagnostic procedures and not for ongoing treatment.  Consult your healthcare provider if you have any questions.
