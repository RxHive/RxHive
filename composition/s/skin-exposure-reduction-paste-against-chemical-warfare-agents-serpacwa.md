# Skin Exposure Reduction Paste Against Chemical Warfare Agents (SERPACWA)
### Generic Name
Skin Exposure Reduction Paste Against Chemical Warfare Agents (SERPACWA)

### Usage
SERPACWA is a topical paste used to reduce or delay the absorption of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) through the skin.  It's crucial to understand that SERPACWA is **only** intended for use in conjunction with mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) gear.  It is not a standalone protective measure and should not be used as a replacement for MOPP gear. Its primary purpose is to provide an additional layer of protection in situations where exposure to CWAs is imminent.  SERPACWA is not intended for use in training exercises due to the risk of polymer fume fever.


### Dosage
**Adults:** The entire contents of an 84-gram package of SERPACWA should be applied evenly to exposed skin areas until a barely noticeable white film is created.  Application should only occur under the threat of imminent CWA exposure.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of SERPACWA in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are provided for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects
*   **Polymer fume fever:** This is a flu-like illness that can occur after exposure to heated PTFE (a component of SERPACWA). This is a significant risk if SERPACWA-contaminated materials are burned.
*   **Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis:** While less common, this serious lung condition is a potential long-term risk associated with exposure to PTFE fumes.

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any adverse effects after using SERPACWA.


### How it Works
SERPACWA acts as a physical barrier on the skin. The paste's components, a perfluoroalkyl polyether (PFPE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), create a film that may reduce or delay the penetration of CWAs into the skin.  It does not neutralize or chemically interact with CWAs; it simply hinders their absorption.


### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
*   **Interactions:** Interactions with other drugs are unknown as this is a topical paste intended for specific emergency situations.
*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** SERPACWA is categorized as pregnancy Category C.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised during breastfeeding.
*   **General Considerations:** SERPACWA is for cutaneous use only. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  Its effectiveness on abraded skin or wounds hasn't been studied.  SERPACWA-contaminated materials should not be burned due to the risk of toxic fumes.  Thoroughly wash hands after application before handling smoking products.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can SERPACWA be used alone without MOPP gear?**  A: No.  SERPACWA is only effective when used in conjunction with MOPP gear. It is not a substitute for MOPP gear.

*   **Q: How long does SERPACWA provide protection?** A: The duration of protection hasn't been studied beyond five hours after application.

*   **Q: What should I do if I get SERPACWA in my eyes?** A: Immediately flush your eyes with plenty of water and seek medical attention.

*   **Q:  Can I use SERPACWA for training exercises?** A: No. Due to the risk of polymer fume fever, SERPACWA should only be used in actual emergencies involving imminent CWA exposure.

*   **Q: What should I do with used SERPACWA packaging and contaminated materials?** A: Do not incinerate; dispose of according to local regulations for hazardous waste.
