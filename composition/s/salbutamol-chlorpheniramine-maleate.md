# Salbutamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Salbutamol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold and influenza (flu).  It's a symptomatic treatment, meaning it alleviates symptoms but doesn't cure the underlying infection.  Salbutamol, a beta-2 agonist, addresses bronchospasm (wheezing and shortness of breath) by relaxing the muscles in the airways. Chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine, helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.  It's often used for relief of symptoms associated with allergies as well. **Importantly, this combination should only be used as directed by a doctor and is not suitable for everyone.  Self-medication can be dangerous.**

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **From Salbutamol:** Tremors, nervousness, headache, increased heart rate, muscle cramps, palpitations.  In rare cases, more serious side effects like irregular heartbeat can occur.
* **From Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention.  In children, it can cause excitement or irritability instead of drowsiness.

**How it Works:**

* **Salbutamol:** Works by binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs. This causes relaxation of the smooth muscles surrounding the airways, leading to bronchodilation (widening of the airways) and relief from wheezing and shortness of breath.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction or infection. By blocking histamine, it reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes.
