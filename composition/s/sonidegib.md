# Sonidegib
### Generic Name
Sonidegib

### Usage
Sonidegib is primarily used to treat locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults.  This means it's used for BCC that has returned after surgery or radiation therapy, or for cases where surgery or radiation isn't a suitable option.  It's a targeted therapy, meaning it works specifically against the cells driving the growth of this type of skin cancer.  Currently, it's not approved for other types of cancer or skin conditions.

### Dosage
Sonidegib is administered orally as a 200 mg capsule once daily.  The treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  Important note:  One 200 mg Sonidegib capsule is equivalent to 281 mg of the diphosphate salt of Sonidegib.  This medication is **not** approved for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

Dosage adjustments are not routinely necessary for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment or mild to moderate renal impairment. However,  close monitoring is crucial in these cases.  If severe or intolerable musculoskeletal side effects occur, or if there's a significant increase in creatine kinase (CK) levels, the dosage may need to be interrupted or permanently stopped.  Specific guidance on dosage adjustments should always come from a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% of patients) can include:

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Muscle pain
*   Altered taste (dysgeusia)
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Decreased appetite
*   Abdominal pain
*   Vomiting
*   Hair loss (alopecia)
*   High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
*   Weight loss
*   Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
*   Increased levels of amylase and lipase
*   Anemia
*   Low lymphocyte count (lymphocytopenia)
*   Increased creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels
*   Increased creatinine levels


Less common, but potentially serious side effects (<10% of patients, some post-marketing reports) include:

*   Itching (pruritus)
*   Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
*   Rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown)

If any adverse effects occur, immediate consultation with a healthcare professional is essential.


### How it Works
Sonidegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor.  The hedgehog signaling pathway is a crucial cellular communication system involved in cell growth and development. In some cancers, like basal cell carcinoma, this pathway is overactive, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Sonidegib works by binding to and blocking a protein called smoothened, a key component of the hedgehog pathway. By inhibiting smoothened, Sonidegib disrupts the signaling cascade, slowing down or stopping the growth of cancer cells.

### Precautions
*   **Pregnancy:** Sonidegib can cause serious birth defects and fetal harm. Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 20 months after the last dose.  Pregnancy should be ruled out before starting treatment.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  Women should not breastfeed during treatment and for 20 months after the final dose.
*   **Children and Adolescents:** Sonidegib is contraindicated in individuals under 18 years old.
*   **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** While dosage adjustments aren't always needed, close monitoring is necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Sonidegib's metabolism can be affected by other medications, particularly those that induce or inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting Sonidegib.
*   **Musculoskeletal Toxicity:**  Sonidegib can increase the risk of muscle problems, including rhabdomyolysis.  Regular monitoring of creatine kinase levels is important.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How should I store Sonidegib?** A:  Store Sonidegib capsules at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.  Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.

*   **Q: Can I take Sonidegib with food?** A: It's recommended to take Sonidegib on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, skip it and resume your regular schedule with the next dose. Do not double the dose.

*   **Q:  Can I donate blood or sperm while taking Sonidegib?** A: No, you should not donate blood or blood products during treatment and for a significant period afterward (at least 20 months for blood).  Men should not donate sperm during treatment and for at least 8 months afterward.

*   **Q: Are there long-term effects of Sonidegib?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is crucial to manage potential side effects and assess the overall impact of the medication.
