# Sulfiram
### Generic Name
Disulfiram

### Usage
Disulfiram is primarily used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. It's not a cure for alcoholism, but it acts as a deterrent.  When taken while consuming alcohol, disulfiram causes a very unpleasant reaction, making it difficult for individuals to continue drinking. This unpleasant reaction serves as a negative reinforcement, helping to support behavioral therapies aimed at maintaining sobriety.  While its primary use is in alcohol dependence treatment,  it's important to note that disulfiram is only effective as part of a comprehensive treatment program that includes counseling and support.  It is not used alone as a standalone treatment for alcoholism.

### Dosage
Dosage of disulfiram varies depending on the individual's response and the physician's judgment.  It's crucial to start with a low dose and gradually increase it under strict medical supervision.

* **Oral Administration (Adults):** Typically, treatment begins with a 250mg daily dose for 1-2 weeks. The maintenance dose may range from 250mg to 500mg daily, depending on the patient's response and tolerance. The physician will adjust the dose as needed. This is usually taken as a single dose once daily.

* **Oral Administration (Children):** Disulfiram is not generally used in children, as its primary use addresses alcohol dependence, a condition not typically present in children.

* **IV Administration:** Disulfiram is not administered intravenously. It is only available in oral tablet form.

**Important Note:** Before initiating disulfiram treatment, a thorough medical history and assessment are essential to rule out any contraindications.  The starting dose should always be low, and the dose should only be adjusted by a healthcare professional.  The patient must be closely monitored for any adverse reactions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of disulfiram can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Drowsiness
* Skin rashes

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Liver damage (hepatitis)
* Optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve)
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities)
* Psychiatric symptoms (depression, psychosis)
* Severe allergic reactions

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is crucial in the metabolism of alcohol.  When a person consuming alcohol takes disulfiram, the alcohol metabolism is disrupted, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde in the body. Acetaldehyde is a toxic intermediate product of alcohol metabolism.  The buildup of acetaldehyde causes unpleasant side effects like flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache, and palpitations. This unpleasant reaction serves as a deterrent to alcohol consumption.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Disulfiram should not be used in individuals with certain medical conditions, including severe cardiovascular disease,  liver disease, kidney disease, brain damage, diabetes, or those with a history of psychosis or severe mental illness. It should also be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Drug Interactions:** Disulfiram interacts with many medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting disulfiram.  Particular caution is advised with medications that affect the liver or central nervous system.

* **Alcohol Consumption:** The most important precaution is strict avoidance of alcohol while taking disulfiram and for a period after treatment discontinuation as advised by a physician. Even small amounts of alcohol can trigger a severe reaction.

* **Specific Populations:**  As mentioned above, disulfiram should be avoided in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and individuals with severe underlying health conditions. Close monitoring is required in older adults.
