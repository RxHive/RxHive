# Somatropin (Genotropin)
### Generic Name
Somatropin (Genotropin)

### Usage

Somatropin is a synthetic version of human growth hormone (hGH).  Its primary use is to replace missing or insufficient growth hormone in individuals with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). This deficiency can occur in adults and children, stemming from various causes including genetic conditions, brain tumors, or damage to the pituitary gland.

In adults, Somatropin is also used to treat:

*   **HIV-associated wasting or cachexia:**  It helps improve body composition and reduce muscle wasting in people with HIV.
*   **Short bowel syndrome:**  It aids in improving nutritional absorption and overall health in adults with this condition.

In children, Somatropin treats growth failure due to several conditions, including:

*   **Inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH):**  This is the most common use in children.
*   **Noonan syndrome:** A genetic disorder causing short stature.
*   **Turner syndrome:** A chromosomal disorder affecting females, resulting in short stature.
*   **Short stature born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth:** For children who remain small despite age-appropriate nutrition.
*   **Idiopathic short stature (ISS):**  Short stature with no identifiable cause.
*   **Growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome:** A genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, and other health issues.


### Dosage

Somatropin dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, specific condition, and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's precise instructions.  Dosing information below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist.


**Adults:**  Dosage varies widely depending on the condition being treated (growth hormone deficiency, HIV-associated wasting, short bowel syndrome).  It is typically administered subcutaneously (under the skin) and can range from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.4 mg/kg daily or on alternate days.  Specific regimens, including maximum daily doses,  are determined by the healthcare provider based on individual needs and response.


**Children:** Dosage is usually calculated in mcg/kg/day or mg/kg/week and is administered subcutaneously. The specific dosage and frequency will differ based on the underlying condition and the child's age and weight. The dosage is frequently adjusted to achieve optimal growth while minimizing side effects.  Like adult dosing,  this is highly individualized.


**Forms:** Somatropin is available in various forms, including injectable solutions (pre-filled pens, vials requiring reconstitution).


### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**  These occur in more than 10% of patients and often are mild.

*   Headache
*   Muscle pain (myalgia)
*   Joint pain (arthralgia)
*   Swelling (edema) in extremities or face
*   Nausea
*   Pain at the injection site

**Less common, but potentially serious side effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

*   Increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia)
*   Fluid retention
*   Increased risk of carpal tunnel syndrome
*   Intracranial hypertension
*   Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*   Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (in children)


If any adverse effects occur, it's essential to contact a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Somatropin mimics the actions of naturally occurring hGH.  It binds to receptors on various cells throughout the body, stimulating growth and affecting metabolism.  The specific effects depend on the target tissue and include:

*   Increased protein synthesis: Building and repairing tissues.
*   Increased lipolysis: Breakdown of fats.
*   Increased glucose production: Regulation of blood sugar.
*   Stimulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation:  Promoting bone growth.
*   Stimulation of erythropoietin: Increasing red blood cell production.


By influencing these processes, Somatropin promotes growth in children and helps to improve body composition and nutritional status in adults with specific conditions.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active malignancies, acute critical illnesses, and certain types of diabetic retinopathy. It is also not suitable for children with closed epiphyses (growth plates).  Individuals with hypersensitivity to Somatropin should avoid using it.  Specific precautions exist for children with Prader-Willi syndrome.
*   **Drug interactions:**  The effects of Somatropin may be altered by certain medications, including corticosteroids, and antidiabetic drugs.  Healthcare professionals should be informed of all medications being taken.
*   **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The safety of Somatropin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult a healthcare provider for guidance on use during these periods.
*   **Specific populations:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed for older adults, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and obese individuals.



### FAQs

*   **Q: How long will I need to take Somatropin?** A: The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the condition and the individual's response.  In children, treatment often continues until growth is complete. In adults, it can be lifelong depending on the diagnosis.

*   **Q: How is Somatropin administered?** A: It is usually injected subcutaneously (under the skin).

*   **Q:  Can I stop taking Somatropin abruptly?** A: No.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for stopping the medication to avoid potential complications.  Discontinuation should be gradual.

*   **Q: How should I store Somatropin?** A:  Store it as directed by the prescribing information; usually refrigeration.


*   **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on missed doses. Do not double the next dose.
