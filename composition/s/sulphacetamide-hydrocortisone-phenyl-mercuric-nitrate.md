# Sulphacetamide + Hydrocortisone + Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate
### Generic Name
Sulphacetamide + Hydrocortisone + Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate


**Please Note:**  This combination is largely obsolete in many parts of the world due to concerns about the toxicity of phenyl mercuric nitrate.  While information is provided below for informational purposes only, it's crucial to understand that this medication is likely unavailable in many regions and safer alternatives are generally preferred.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for current treatment options.


### Usage
This combination medication was traditionally used as a topical ophthalmic (eye) preparation to treat various bacterial and inflammatory eye conditions.  The sulphacetamide component acts as an antibacterial agent, targeting a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly causing eye infections like conjunctivitis (pink eye). Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, helps reduce inflammation and swelling in the eye.  Phenyl mercuric nitrate was included as a preservative, although this is now considered outdated and potentially harmful.  The primary use was for bacterial conjunctivitis with associated inflammation.  Secondary uses might have included other superficial eye infections with an inflammatory component, but this should always be guided by a physician's diagnosis.


### Dosage
Dosage instructions for this specific combination would vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  **However, it's crucial to reiterate that this combination is largely obsolete and specific dosage information is likely unavailable from modern sources.**  Any historical dosage instructions should be approached with caution and should not be used as guidance for self-medication.  Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for appropriate treatment.  In the past, the medication was typically administered as eye drops, with instructions usually provided on the product label.


### Side Effects
* **Common:** Burning or stinging sensation upon application, temporary blurred vision, mild itching.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), increased eye pressure (glaucoma), eye irritation, secondary infections (due to suppression of normal flora).  **The use of phenyl mercuric nitrate was associated with significant toxicity concerns, including potential systemic effects.**
* **Note:**  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects might occur.  If any adverse reactions are experienced, stop using the medication and seek medical attention immediately.


### How it Works
Sulphacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with folic acid synthesis, a crucial process for bacterial cell division and growth.  Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by suppressing the body's immune response and decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators.  Phenyl mercuric nitrate acted as a preservative, preventing the growth of microorganisms in the medication itself.  Together, these components aimed to treat both the bacterial infection and the associated inflammation in the eye.

* **Contraindications:** This combination is contraindicated in patients with known allergies to any of its components (sulphacetamide, hydrocortisone, or phenyl mercuric nitrate).  It should not be used for viral or fungal eye infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are possible, though the specific interactions would depend on the specific medication.  Consult a physician or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  This combination is generally not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential risks of the components.  Children should only use this under strict medical supervision.  Use with caution in individuals with glaucoma or other eye conditions.   **The presence of phenyl mercuric nitrate poses a significant safety concern due to its toxicity.**
* **Storage:** Store as directed on the label if the medication is still available.
