# Sultamicillin
### Generic Name
Sultamicillin

### Usage
Sultamicillin is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating infections affecting the skin and skin structures, upper and lower respiratory tracts, urinary tract (including pyelonephritis – a kidney infection), and it's also effective against uncomplicated gonorrhea.  While not its primary indication, it can be used for other bacterial infections depending on the specific bacteria involved and susceptibility testing.  Always consult a doctor to determine if sultamicillin is appropriate for your specific infection.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Sultamicillin 375 mg contains 147 mg of sulbactam and 220 mg of ampicillin.

**Adults:**

* **Bacterial Infections (Skin, Respiratory, Urinary Tract):** The typical dose is 375-750 mg every 12 hours, orally, for 5-14 days.  For infections caused by Group A Streptococcus, a minimum of 10 days of treatment is recommended to prevent complications like rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis.
* **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea:** A single 2.25 g oral dose is usually prescribed, taken concurrently with 1 g of probenecid.

**Children and Adolescents:**

* **Bacterial Infections (Skin, Respiratory, Urinary Tract):**
    * For those weighing less than 30 kg: 25-50 mg/kg/day divided into two doses, orally, for 5-14 days.  Again, at least 10 days is needed for Group A Streptococcus infections.
    * For those weighing 30 kg or more: Same dosage as adults.
* **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea:**  For those weighing 30 kg or more: Same dosage as adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance, CrCl).  Consult a doctor for specific guidance.  Generally, lower doses and longer intervals are used.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Currently, there are no specific dosage adjustments recommended by the manufacturer for those with liver problems, however, it is best to consult with a physician to determine if dosage adjustments are needed.

### How it Works

Sultamicillin is a combination antibiotic containing ampicillin and sulbactam. Ampicillin works by interfering with the bacterial cell wall's construction, ultimately causing the bacteria to break down and die.  Sulbactam protects ampicillin from being deactivated by certain enzymes (beta-lactamases) produced by some bacteria, enhancing its effectiveness against a wider range of bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Do not use sultamicillin if you have a known allergy to penicillins, ampicillin, sulbactam, or any component of the medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Sultamicillin can interact with other medications, including allopurinol, anticoagulants, bacteriostatic antibiotics (like tetracycline or erythromycin), oral contraceptives, methotrexate, and probenecid.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sultamicillin is classified as Pregnancy Category B.  While it's generally considered safe for pregnant women, consult your doctor.  It's excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding should be avoided while taking it.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Careful monitoring and dosage adjustments are needed in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Be aware of the potential for allergic reactions, ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis.  If you experience any signs of an allergic reaction (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), seek immediate medical help.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take sultamicillin with food?** A: Sultamicillin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store sultamicillin?** A: Store sultamicillin according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Reconstituted oral suspensions should be refrigerated.
