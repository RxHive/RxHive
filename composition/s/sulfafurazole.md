# Sulfafurazole
### Generic Name
Sulfafurazole (Sulfisoxazole)

### Usage

Sulfafurazole, also known as sulfisoxazole, is a sulfonamide antibiotic.  Its primary use is in treating bacterial infections, particularly those of the urinary tract. It's also effective against certain types of pneumonia caused by *Chlamydia pneumoniae*, as well as other chlamydial infections like trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum.  It can be used in treating nocardiosis (a rare bacterial infection).  Sulfafurazole is sometimes used in combination with erythromycin to treat otitis media (middle ear infection).  It's important to note that the use of sulfafurazole is becoming less common due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the availability of newer, broader-spectrum antibiotics.  A doctor will determine the appropriate use based on the specific infection and its severity.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** For urinary tract infections, chlamydial pneumonia, nocardiosis, trachoma, lymphogranuloma venereum, chlamydial infections, and otitis media (in conjunction with erythromycin), the typical oral dosage is an initial dose of 2-4 grams, followed by 4-8 grams per day divided into doses every 4-6 hours.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Sulfafurazole is generally not recommended for infants under 2 months old (except in specific cases of congenital toxoplasmosis with pyrimethamine). For children 2 months and older with the same infections as listed above, the usual oral dose is an initial dose of 75 mg/kg, followed by 150 mg/kg/day divided into 4-6 doses. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 6 grams.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  The specific adjustments depend on the severity of the impairment and should be determined by a doctor.  Individuals undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis will also require specific dosage adjustments following the procedure.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)

Less common but more serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Blood disorders (e.g., blood dyscrasias)
* Liver damage (jaundice, hepatomegaly)
* Kidney damage (crystalluria)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a rare but serious skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a life-threatening skin reaction)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)


If any adverse effects occur, particularly those listed as more serious, immediate medical attention should be sought.


### How it Works

Sulfafurazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic that works by interfering with the production of folic acid in bacteria. Folic acid is essential for bacterial growth and reproduction. By preventing the bacteria from synthesizing folic acid, sulfafurazole inhibits their growth and ultimately leads to their death.  This mechanism targets bacteria specifically, as humans obtain folic acid through their diet rather than synthesizing it.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Sulfafurazole should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to sulfonamides, infants under 2 months old (generally), pregnant women in their third trimester, breastfeeding women, those with certain blood disorders, or those with acute porphyria.

**Interactions:**  Sulfafurazole can interact with several other medications, including oral anticoagulants (increasing bleeding risk), sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents (potentiating hypoglycemic effects), thiazide diuretics, and uricosuric agents.  Its serum concentration can be increased by salicylates, indomethacin, and probenecid.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

**Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, allergies or asthma, liver or kidney impairment, AIDS, the elderly, those who are slow acetylators (a genetic factor affecting drug metabolism), and those with systemic lupus erythematosus. Prolonged sun exposure should be avoided, and protective measures should be taken due to the potential for photosensitivity.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take sulfafurazole with food?** A: Yes, it's often recommended to take sulfafurazole with food to minimize gastrointestinal upset.

* **Q: How should I store sulfafurazole?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Is sulfafurazole safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  No, it's contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Severe allergic reactions to sulfafurazole can be life-threatening.
