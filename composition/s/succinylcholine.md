# Succinylcholine
### Generic Name
Succinylcholine (also known as Suxamethonium)

### Usage

Succinylcholine is primarily a neuromuscular-blocking agent.  Its main use is as an adjunct to general anesthesia, facilitating tracheal intubation (insertion of a breathing tube) and providing skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.  It's a short-acting paralytic, meaning it temporarily stops muscle movement. This is crucial for procedures requiring complete muscle relaxation, such as certain surgeries and procedures involving mechanical ventilation.  It's also used off-label in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to help relax muscles during the procedure.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (intravenous [IV] or intramuscular [IM]), the patient's age and weight, and the specific medical procedure.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.  Precise dosing information is crucial and should be obtained from the prescribing physician or the medication's package insert.  The information below is for illustrative purposes only and should *not* be used for self-medication.


**Adults:**

* **Intubation:** IV: 0.6 mg/kg (dosage range 0.3-1.1 mg/kg); IM: 3-4 mg/kg (maximum total dose 150 mg).  Rapid-sequence intubation may use higher IV doses (1-1.5 mg/kg).
* **Surgery/Mechanical Ventilation (intermittent):** IV: Initial dose 0.3-1.1 mg/kg, followed by smaller doses (0.04-0.07 mg/kg) as needed.
* **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT):** IV: 0.5-1.5 mg/kg, titrated based on factors like muscle mass and patient response.


**Children:**  Dosage in children is significantly lower and dependent on age and weight, and must be calculated by a medical professional. Intramuscular and intravenous dosages are different and must be administered correctly.  Never use adult dosing for children.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, these conditions can influence drug metabolism and clearance, requiring careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments under medical supervision.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Muscle fasciculations (brief muscle twitching)
* Increased salivation (sialorrhea)
* Transient increases or decreases in blood pressure and heart rate (including bradycardia and tachycardia)
* Transient increases in intraocular pressure


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Malignant hyperthermia (a life-threatening reaction)
* Apnea (cessation of breathing) â€“ prolonged apnea is a significant risk
* Hyperkalemia (dangerously high potassium levels in the blood)  This is particularly risky in certain patient populations, such as those with muscle disorders.
* Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue, which can lead to kidney failure)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker.  It mimics the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that triggers muscle contraction.  By binding to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, succinylcholine initially causes muscle depolarization (activation), leading to brief fasciculations. Subsequently, it prolongs the depolarization, preventing further muscle stimulation and resulting in muscle paralysis.  The effect is temporary, as the drug is rapidly metabolized by plasma cholinesterase.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Succinylcholine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity, certain muscle disorders (like myopathies), and those with a history of malignant hyperthermia.  Use in patients with severe burns or recent trauma should be carefully considered due to an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Many drugs can interact with succinylcholine, potentially prolonging its effects or increasing the risk of side effects. These include other neuromuscular blockers, certain antibiotics, and some anesthetic agents.  Inform your physician of all medications you're taking.
* **Special Populations:**  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should use succinylcholine only when clearly necessary, under strict medical supervision, given the potential for prolonged effects.  Children and older adults require special care in dosing and monitoring due to variations in drug metabolism and potential increased sensitivity.
* **Malignant Hyperthermia:**  This life-threatening condition is a rare but severe adverse reaction to succinylcholine.  Those with a family history of malignant hyperthermia should avoid this drug.
* **Hyperkalemia:**  Succinylcholine can cause a sudden and dangerous increase in potassium levels (hyperkalemia), particularly in individuals with pre-existing muscle damage.  Close monitoring is essential, especially in children and those with underlying neuromuscular diseases.


### FAQs

* **How long does the effect of succinylcholine last?** The effects are typically short-lived (a few minutes), but the duration can be affected by several factors, including the dose, patient factors, and drug interactions.
* **How is succinylcholine stored?** Store succinylcholine as directed by the manufacturer, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Can I take succinylcholine without a prescription?**  No. Succinylcholine is a powerful drug that must be prescribed and administered by a qualified healthcare professional.  Incorrect use can be extremely dangerous and even fatal.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Succinylcholine is usually administered as a single dose during a surgical procedure or other medical intervention. Missing a scheduled dose is not typically relevant.
* **What are the long-term effects of succinylcholine?** Succinylcholine is not intended for long-term use; its effects are temporary. Prolonged exposure, however, can be linked to rare complications such as muscle damage and myositis ossificans (abnormal bone formation in muscle tissue).
