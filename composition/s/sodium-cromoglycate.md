# Sodium Cromoglycate
### Generic Name
Sodium Cromoglycate

### Usage
Sodium cromoglycate is primarily used to prevent asthma attacks and allergic reactions. It's not a rescue medication for an acute asthma attack; rather, it works to prevent them from happening in the first place.  It achieves this by stabilizing mast cells, preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances that trigger allergic reactions and bronchospasm in the airways.  While its main use is in asthma management, it also finds application in preventing allergic rhinitis (hay fever) symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.  In some cases, it may be used to treat other allergic conditions, but this is less common.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated, the age of the patient, and the formulation of the medication (e.g., nasal spray, inhaler, eye drops).  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  There isn't a standardized, universally applicable dosage guide.  

* **Asthma (Inhaler):**  For adults and children (usually over 5 years old), the typical dosage is 1-2 inhalations four times a day.  Specific dosages and frequency should be determined by a physician, considering the severity of the asthma.  Children may require a different dosage based on age and weight.

* **Allergic Rhinitis (Nasal Spray):**  The typical dose is 1-2 sprays in each nostril two to four times a day. Again, this is a general guideline, and your doctor will prescribe the appropriate dose.

* **Conjunctivitis (Eye Drops):**  The usual dose is one or two drops in the affected eye(s) four times a day.

* **Oral:** Oral formulations are less common and dosages are determined by the physician, depending on the specific condition and patient factors.

**Important Note:**  Never adjust your dosage without consulting your doctor.  Incorrect usage can be ineffective and potentially harmful.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  These are generally mild and may include a slightly bitter taste (especially with inhalers), throat irritation, and coughing.  Nasal sprays may cause a slight burning sensation.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Although rare, serious allergic reactions can occur. Symptoms include swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, hives, or rash.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


### How it Works

Sodium cromoglycate works by preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells.  Mast cells are immune cells involved in allergic reactions.  When an allergen (such as pollen or dust mites) triggers an allergic response, mast cells release these inflammatory substances, leading to symptoms like bronchospasm (in asthma) and sneezing/runny nose (in allergic rhinitis).  By stabilizing mast cells and preventing the release of these mediators, sodium cromoglycate helps to reduce inflammation and prevent the symptoms of allergic reactions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** There are few absolute contraindications.  However, individuals with known hypersensitivity to sodium cromoglycate should avoid its use.

* **Drug Interactions:**  While no significant drug interactions are typically reported, informing your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, is crucial for optimal safety.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of sodium cromoglycate during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been extensively studied.  It should only be used during these periods if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Children:**  Safety and efficacy in very young children varies depending on the formulation and condition being treated, always follow physician's recommendations.

* **Elderly:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed for elderly patients, but monitoring for side effects is essential.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use sodium cromoglycate as a rescue medication for an asthma attack?**
   * **A:** No, sodium cromoglycate is a preventative medication, not a rescue medication.  Use an inhaler prescribed by your doctor for acute asthma attacks.

* **Q: How should I store sodium cromoglycate?**
   * **A:** Store it according to the instructions on the product label. This usually involves storing it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**
   * **A:** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Is sodium cromoglycate habit-forming?**
   * **A:** No, sodium cromoglycate is not a habit-forming medication.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking sodium cromoglycate suddenly?**
   * **A:** It's generally advisable to gradually reduce the dosage under the guidance of your doctor before stopping, to avoid potential relapse or worsening symptoms.  Never stop abruptly without consulting your physician.
