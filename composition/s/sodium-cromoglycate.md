# Sodium Cromoglycate

**Generic Name:** Sodium Cromoglycate (also known as cromolyn sodium)

**Usage:**

Sodium cromoglycate is used to prevent asthma attacks and allergic reactions.  It's not a rescue medication for an attack already in progress.  It's used for:

* **Asthma:** To prevent asthma attacks triggered by allergens or irritants like pollen, dust mites, or exercise.
* **Allergic rhinitis (hay fever):** To reduce symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
* **Mast cell-related disorders:**  In some cases, it may be used for other conditions involving mast cell activation.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and infrequent.  They can include:

* **Respiratory:** Cough, throat irritation, shortness of breath (rare)
* **Local (with nasal spray or inhaler):** Nasal burning or stinging (with nasal spray), bad taste in mouth (with inhaler)
* **Other:** Headache, nausea


**How it Works:**

Sodium cromoglycate works by stabilizing mast cells. Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other inflammatory substances when triggered by allergens or irritants.  These substances contribute to the symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis. By stabilizing mast cells, sodium cromoglycate prevents the release of these inflammatory mediators, thus reducing symptoms. It doesn't treat an existing inflammatory response, but rather prevents its initiation.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is sodium cromoglycate a steroid?** A: No, sodium cromoglycate is not a steroid. It works through a different mechanism.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: It's preventative, so it needs to be used regularly before exposure to allergens to be effective.  You may not notice immediate relief, but effects build up over time with consistent use.

* **Q: Can I use it during an asthma attack?** A: No, sodium cromoglycate is not a rescue medication for acute asthma attacks.  Use a quick-relief inhaler (like albuterol) for immediate symptom relief during an attack.

* **Q: Can I use it with other medications?** A:  It can generally be used with other asthma or allergy medications, but always consult your doctor or pharmacist to ensure no interactions occur.

* **Q: What forms does it come in?** A: Sodium cromoglycate is available as an inhaler for asthma, a nasal spray for allergic rhinitis, and eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis.

* **Q: Are there any precautions I should take?** A:  Individuals with a known hypersensitivity to sodium cromoglycate should avoid it.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and inform them of any other medical conditions or medications you are taking.
