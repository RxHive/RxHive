# Sodium Bicarbonate

**Generic Name:** Sodium Bicarbonate

**Usage:**

Sodium bicarbonate has a wide range of uses, both medically and domestically.  Its uses include:

* **Medical:**  Treating mild acidosis (excess acid in the blood), relieving heartburn and indigestion (as an antacid), treating mild cases of urinary tract infections (to alkalinize the urine), rinsing the mouth (as a mouthwash), and as a component in some intravenous fluids. It may also be used to flush out the stomach in cases of poisoning (under medical supervision only).
* **Domestic:**  Baking (as a leavening agent), cleaning (to deodorize, scrub, and remove stains), pest control (controlling some garden pests), and in swimming pools (to adjust pH).


**Side Effects:**

While generally safe when used as directed, excessive or incorrect use of sodium bicarbonate can lead to side effects, including:

* **Metabolic alkalosis:**  This is a condition where the blood becomes overly alkaline, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and confusion.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:** High sodium intake can affect the balance of electrolytes in the body, leading to various symptoms depending on the imbalance.
* **Fluid retention:** Sodium can cause the body to retain water, leading to swelling.
* **Hypokalemia:** In cases of prolonged or excessive use, sodium bicarbonate can deplete potassium levels in the body.
* **Gastric upset:** While it can treat indigestion, it can also cause upset stomach or diarrhea in some individuals.


**How it Works:**

Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCOâ‚ƒ) is a weak base.  Its primary mechanism of action involves neutralizing acids.  When it comes into contact with an acid, it reacts to form water, carbon dioxide, and a salt, thus reducing the acidity.  This is why it's effective as an antacid and in treating acidosis.  In baking, the reaction with acids produces carbon dioxide gas, which causes dough to rise.

**FAQs:**

* **Is sodium bicarbonate the same as baking soda?** Yes, sodium bicarbonate and baking soda are the same thing.
* **Is sodium bicarbonate safe to consume regularly?** No, regular or excessive consumption of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended without medical advice.  It can lead to serious side effects.
* **Can I use sodium bicarbonate to treat all types of indigestion?** No, it's only effective for mild indigestion caused by excess stomach acid.  More severe indigestion or other gastrointestinal issues require medical attention.
* **Can I use sodium bicarbonate to clean everything?**  While it's a useful cleaning agent for many things, it's not suitable for all surfaces. It can be abrasive and may damage some materials.  Always test on a small inconspicuous area first.
* **What should I do if I accidentally ingest too much sodium bicarbonate?** Contact a doctor or poison control immediately.
