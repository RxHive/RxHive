# Sodium Bicarbonate
### Generic Name
Sodium Bicarbonate

### Usage

Sodium bicarbonate is primarily used to treat metabolic acidosis, a condition where the body has too much acid in its blood.  This can stem from various causes, including severe kidney disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory problems due to shock or dehydration, and situations involving extracorporeal circulation (like during heart surgery). It's also used in cases of cardiac arrest and severe lactic acidosis.  Beyond metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarbonate has secondary uses. It acts as an antacid to relieve heartburn and indigestion, and it can help in managing hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) by shifting potassium into cells.  It's also used topically to soothe minor skin irritations.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.  Here are some examples:

**Adults:**

* **Antacid:** 325 mg to 2 g orally, 1-4 times daily.
* **Hyperkalemia (IV):** 50 mEq over 5 minutes, as determined by a doctor.  Additional measures to lower potassium may also be necessary.

**Children:**

Dosages for children are significantly more variable and depend heavily on the child's weight and the specific condition being treated.  **Never administer medication to a child without explicit instructions from a doctor.** Examples include:

* **Hyperacidity (Oral, children ≥ 5 years):** ½ teaspoonful of powder per dose, repeated up to every 2 hours, but not exceeding 7 doses in 24 hours.  Not for use longer than 2 weeks.
* **Cardiac arrest (IV or intraosseous):** 1 mEq/kg/dose.  Further doses guided by blood gas levels.  For infants and children under 2 years, a 4.2% solution (0.5 mEq/mL) should be used.
* **Metabolic Acidosis (IV):**  Blood gas analysis is typically used to guide dosage, often calculated based on the child's weight and the severity of acidosis.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose and schedule.
* **Hyperkalemia (IV):** 1-2 mEq/kg/dose, used to redistribute potassium.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild but can include:

* Abdominal distention
* Eructation (belching)
* Flatulence (gas)

Less common, but more serious, side effects can occur, particularly with higher doses or intravenous administration, and include:

* Metabolic alkalosis (too much base in the blood)
* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Hypocalcemia (low calcium levels)
* Edema (swelling)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Tetany (muscle spasms)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Sodium bicarbonate is an alkali that neutralizes excess acid in the body. When administered, it dissociates into sodium and bicarbonate ions.  The bicarbonate ions react with hydrogen ions (which contribute to acidity) to form carbonic acid, which then breaks down into water and carbon dioxide.  The carbon dioxide is exhaled, thereby reducing the overall acidity of the blood. In the case of hyperkalemia, it facilitates the shift of potassium ions from the extracellular fluid into the cells, lowering the potassium concentration in the blood.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Sodium bicarbonate is contraindicated in patients with alkalosis (already high blood pH), hypernatremia, severe pulmonary edema, hypocalcemia, abdominal pain of unknown origin and when used as a systemic alkalizer.
* **Drug Interactions:** Sodium bicarbonate can interact with numerous medications, altering their absorption or effectiveness.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered due to potential risks of metabolic alkalosis and fluid overload.  Sodium bicarbonate is excreted in breast milk.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with kidney or liver disease due to the risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
* **Other Precautions:**  Avoid taking with milk or calcium-containing products.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use sodium bicarbonate as an antacid regularly?** A: While it can be used for occasional heartburn, prolonged or frequent use as an antacid should be discussed with your doctor, as it can lead to electrolyte imbalances.
* **Q: How should I store sodium bicarbonate?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Is sodium bicarbonate safe for everyone?** A: No, it has contraindications and potential interactions. Consult a doctor before using, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions or are taking other medications.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally take too much sodium bicarbonate?** A: Contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately.
* **Q:  Can I use sodium bicarbonate to treat all types of acidosis?** A: No, it's primarily effective for metabolic acidosis. Other types of acidosis require different treatment approaches.
