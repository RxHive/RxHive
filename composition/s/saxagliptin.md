# Saxagliptin
### Generic Name
Saxagliptin

### Usage
Saxagliptin is a medication used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's not used for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.  Saxagliptin works best when used along with diet and exercise. It may be used alone or with other diabetes medications, depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  Its primary role is to improve glycemic control (blood sugar levels), but it's not associated with improvements in cardiovascular or renal outcomes.  It's sometimes preferred when minimizing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and weight gain is a priority.

### Dosage
**Adults with Type 2 Diabetes:** The typical starting dose is 2.5 to 5 mg once daily (OD) by mouth.  A lower dose of 2.5 mg OD is recommended for patients taking strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (certain medications that affect how the body processes drugs).  The choice between 2.5mg and 5mg depends on the individual's response to treatment and blood sugar levels.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on kidney function.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of saxagliptin in children haven't been established.  It shouldn't be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Kidney Problems (Renal Impairment):** If your estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is 45 mL/minute/1.73 m² or higher, no dosage adjustment is needed. If your eGFR is below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m², the dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg once daily. For those on hemodialysis (a type of kidney dialysis), the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, administered after dialysis.  Dosage adjustments for peritoneal dialysis aren't specified in the manufacturer's information.
* **Liver Problems (Hepatic Impairment):**  No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Use with Other Medications:** If saxagliptin is used with insulin or a sulfonylurea (another type of diabetes medication), a lower dose of the insulin or sulfonylurea might be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

Saxagliptin tablets should be swallowed whole; they should not be broken or crushed.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Urinary tract infection
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, including facial edema [swelling] and urticaria [hives])

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
* Severe arthralgia (joint pain)
* Bullous pemphigoid (a type of blistering skin disease)
* Exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin inflammation)


If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretin hormones. Incretin hormones (like GLP-1 and GIP) are released after eating and help your body produce more insulin and reduce the amount of sugar your liver releases. By blocking DPP-4, saxagliptin increases the levels of these incretin hormones, leading to improved insulin release and lower blood sugar, specifically in response to food intake.

### Precautions
**Contraindications (Saxagliptin should not be used if):**

* You have a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to saxagliptin (such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, or exfoliative skin conditions).
* You have a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions to other DPP-4 inhibitors.
* You have diabetic ketoacidosis.
* You have diabetic coma or precoma.
* You have type 1 diabetes.


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Heart failure:** Saxagliptin may increase the risk of heart failure.
* **Pancreatitis:** Saxagliptin may increase the risk of pancreatitis.
* **Severe arthralgia:** Saxagliptin has been associated with severe joint pain.
* **Bullous pemphigoid:** Saxagliptin may increase the risk of this blistering skin disease.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Be aware of potential allergic reactions.
* **Decreased lymphocyte count:**  Saxagliptin can lower lymphocyte counts (a type of white blood cell). This is generally dose-related.
* **Renal impairment:**  Saxagliptin needs dose adjustment in individuals with moderate to severe kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Saxagliptin is a category B drug in pregnancy, meaning studies in animals haven't shown risk, but there is no human data.  Other medications are generally preferred during pregnancy for diabetes management. It's unknown whether saxagliptin is excreted in breast milk.
* **Drug Interactions:** Saxagliptin can interact with several other medications, so it's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  This is particularly important for other diabetes medications, diuretics, corticosteroids, and certain enzyme inhibitors and inducers.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take saxagliptin with other medications?** A: It's crucial to discuss all medications (including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies) with your doctor before starting saxagliptin, as it can interact with other drugs.  Dosage adjustments of other diabetes medications may be required.
* **Q: How should I store saxagliptin?** A:  Store saxagliptin at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Follow the specific storage instructions on the label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking saxagliptin suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking saxagliptin suddenly.  Consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.
* **Q: Is saxagliptin right for me?** A:  Whether saxagliptin is appropriate for you depends on your individual health condition and other factors.  Your doctor can help determine if it's the right medication for you.
