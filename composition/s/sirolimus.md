# Sirolimus
### Generic Name
Sirolimus

### Usage
Sirolimus is primarily used to prevent organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older who have received kidney transplants.  It's an immunosuppressant, meaning it weakens the body's immune system to prevent it from attacking the transplanted kidney.  This is crucial because the body's immune system might otherwise recognize the new kidney as foreign and try to destroy it.  Beyond kidney transplants, Sirolimus also treats lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare lung disease that primarily affects women.  It's important to note that Sirolimus is sometimes used off-label in other conditions like graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but its use in these cases requires careful monitoring and is not universally recommended.

### Dosage
Sirolimus dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's weight and age, and other medications being taken.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's instructions precisely.  Note that Sirolimus tablets and oral solutions are not bioequivalent; however, they are interchangeable on a milligram-per-milligram basis.

**Renal Transplant (Rejection Prophylaxis):**

* **Low-to-moderate immunologic risk (adults and adolescents ≥13 years):**  A loading dose is typically given on day one, followed by a daily maintenance dose.  The specific amounts depend on weight:  under 40 kg, a different dosing calculation is used than for patients 40kg and over.  Dosage adjustments are frequent to maintain specific blood levels of the drug.  In some cases, cyclosporine may be gradually withdrawn after a few months of combined therapy, necessitating a Sirolimus dosage increase.

* **High immunologic risk (adults and adolescents ≥13 years):** Higher loading and maintenance doses are used, and concurrent cyclosporine therapy is typically continued for a year post-transplant.

* **Pediatric patients (<13 years):** Dosage is adjusted based on body surface area (mg/m²) and weight, similar to the adult low-to-moderate risk protocol.

**Lymphangioleiomyomatosis:**

* Adults and adolescents ≥13 years: A starting dose of 2mg daily is common, followed by adjustments based on blood levels to reach a target range.

**Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (off-label):** Dosage varies considerably depending on whether it's for prophylaxis or treatment of acute or chronic GVHD.  These doses are not standardized and require close medical supervision.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary based on factors like liver and kidney function.  Reduced doses are usually recommended for those with impaired liver function.


### Side Effects
Sirolimus can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any concerning symptoms.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Pain
* Dizziness
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Skin rash
* Acne
* High cholesterol and triglycerides
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Urinary tract infection
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Impaired wound healing
* Increased risk of infection (including opportunistic infections)
* Lymphoma and other cancers
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* Lung problems (including interstitial lung disease)
*  Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (a rare and serious brain infection)


This list is not exhaustive. Other side effects are possible.

### How it Works
Sirolimus is an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor.  mTOR is a protein involved in cell growth, division, and survival.  By blocking mTOR, Sirolimus suppresses the immune system's activity, preventing it from attacking a transplanted organ.  In the case of LAM, Sirolimus works by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway, which is abnormally active in LAM cells, leading to reduced cell growth and improved lung function.

### Precautions
Several precautions are associated with Sirolimus use:

* **Contraindications:**  Sirolimus is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Sirolimus, macrolide antibiotics, or any components of the formulation.  It should not be used with live vaccines.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Numerous drug interactions are possible. Sirolimus should be used cautiously with other medications that affect kidney or liver function, or those metabolized by the same enzymes (CYP3A4).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Sirolimus is a Category C drug during pregnancy; it may harm the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 12 weeks afterward.  The safety of Sirolimus in breastfeeding is unknown.
* **Specific Populations:** Patients with impaired liver or kidney function may need dosage adjustments.  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Other Warnings:**  Increased risk of infections, certain types of cancer, and other serious complications exist.  Regular monitoring is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Sirolimus with food?** A: Sirolimus can be taken with or without food, but consistency is important to minimize absorption variability. Follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: How should I store Sirolimus?** A: Store Sirolimus as directed by your pharmacist or doctor; usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double up on doses. Contact your doctor or pharmacist for advice.

* **Q:  Are there specific blood tests needed while taking Sirolimus?** A: Yes, regular blood tests to monitor Sirolimus levels, kidney and liver function, blood counts, and lipid levels are usually required.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while on Sirolimus?** A:  It is generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking Sirolimus as it can interact with the medication and increase the risk of side effects.  Discuss this with your doctor.
