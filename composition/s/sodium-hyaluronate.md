**How it Works:** Sodium hyaluronate is a salt form of hyaluronic acid, a naturally occurring substance in the body.  It acts as a humectant, meaning it attracts and retains water. This contributes to its diverse uses:

* **Lubrication:**  Its water-retaining properties make it an excellent lubricant for joints and eyes.
* **Tissue Repair:**  It promotes cell proliferation and migration, aiding in wound healing.
* **Volume Enhancement:**  In dermal fillers, it adds volume to the skin, reducing the appearance of wrinkles.
* **Pain Reduction (joints):** Its viscoelastic properties help to cushion and lubricate joints, reducing pain and improving joint function.
