# Strontium Chloride
### Generic Name
Strontium-89 Chloride (Sr-89Cl)

### Usage
Strontium-89 Chloride is a radioactive pharmaceutical used primarily to alleviate bone pain associated with painful skeletal metastases (cancer that has spread to the bones).  It's specifically designed to target areas of increased bone turnover, often seen in cancers such as prostate, breast, and multiple myeloma.  The drug doesn't cure cancer, but it effectively reduces pain by targeting the affected bone tissue. This treatment is palliative, meaning it aims to improve the quality of life by managing symptoms rather than curing the underlying disease.

### Dosage
Strontium-89 Chloride is administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional. The dosage is determined individually based on factors such as the patient's body weight and the extent of bone metastases.  It's crucial to understand that this is not a medication to be self-administered; a physician must carefully calculate the correct dose and supervise the injection.  There is no established dosage for children as this medication is generally only used in adults with cancer.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Bone marrow suppression (reduction in blood cell production) leading to a decreased white blood cell count (increasing infection risk), low red blood cell count (anemia), and low platelet count (increased bleeding risk).
* Mild to moderate myelosuppression (suppression of bone marrow function)

Less common, but serious side effects:

* Severe bone marrow suppression
* Serious allergic reactions
* Radiation sickness (in rare cases with very high doses)

**It is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.**


### How it Works
Strontium-89 Chloride works by targeting areas of high bone turnover, common in metastatic bone disease.  Strontium is chemically similar to calcium and is readily absorbed by bone tissue.  The strontium-89 isotope is radioactive, emitting beta particles that destroy rapidly dividing cancer cells in the bone marrow and surrounding tissues.  This localized radiation therapy effectively reduces bone pain by targeting the source of the pain â€“ the cancerous cells and their activity within the bone. The low-energy beta particles have a limited range, minimizing exposure to other organs.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Strontium-89 Chloride is contraindicated in patients with significant bone marrow suppression or hypersensitivity to strontium.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not receive this medication due to the risk of radiation exposure to the fetus or infant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as some medications may interact with Strontium-89 Chloride.  
* **Renal Impairment:** Patients with impaired kidney function should be monitored closely as the kidneys are responsible for the excretion of strontium.
* **Elderly Patients:** The elderly may be more susceptible to some of the side effects.
* **Safety Measures:**  Strict radiation safety protocols are followed when handling and administering this medication. Healthcare professionals will take necessary precautions to minimize radiation exposure to themselves and others.

### FAQs
* **Q: How long does the pain relief last?** A: The duration of pain relief varies among patients, but it typically lasts several weeks to months.
* **Q: Is Strontium-89 Chloride a cure for cancer?** A: No, it is a palliative treatment to manage bone pain; it does not cure the underlying cancer.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Strontium-89 Chloride?** A: Long-term effects are generally minimal, but ongoing monitoring is important to assess bone marrow function and any potential delayed side effects.
* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: Strontium-89 Chloride should be stored according to the instructions provided by your physician or pharmacist, usually under specific conditions to maintain its radioactive properties.
* **Q: Can I drive after receiving the injection?** A:  Fatigue is a possible side effect. It's advisable to follow your physician's advice regarding driving and other activities.
