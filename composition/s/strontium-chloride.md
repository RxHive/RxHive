# Strontium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Strontium Chloride

**Usage:**

Strontium chloride has limited medical uses, primarily as a component in some topical treatments for skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.  Its main use is not as a standalone drug but as an ingredient in specific formulations.  It's also used in some veterinary applications. It's *not* generally used internally except in highly specific and controlled medical settings.  The use of strontium chloride outside of medical settings should be avoided due to potential toxicity.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are largely dependent on the route of administration and concentration.  Topical application may cause mild irritation, redness, or burning at the application site.  Ingestion of significant quantities can be toxic, leading to:

* **Gastrointestinal distress:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Cardiovascular effects:** Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* **Neurological effects:** Muscle weakness, tremors, seizures (in severe cases).
* **Kidney damage:**  High doses can damage kidneys.

It's important to note that systemic side effects are more likely with ingestion or injection than with topical application.

**How it Works:**

The mechanism of action for strontium chloride in topical applications isn't fully understood, but it's believed to have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties which may help reduce inflammation and cell growth in conditions like eczema and psoriasis.  Its precise mechanism at a cellular level needs further research.

**FAQs:**

* **Is strontium chloride safe?**  In appropriate concentrations and with proper administration (typically topical), it is generally considered safe for certain specific skin conditions, but ingestion or misuse can be very dangerous. Always follow instructions carefully.
