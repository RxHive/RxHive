# Sodium Picosulfate + Milk of Magnesia

**Generic Name:** Sodium Picosulfate + Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia)

**Usage:** This combination is a laxative used for the relief of occasional constipation.  It is typically used for short-term relief and is not intended for regular use. It works by stimulating bowel movements.  It's important to follow the dosage instructions on the product label carefully.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, sodium picosulfate + magnesium hydroxide can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* Abdominal cramping or pain
* Diarrhea (potentially severe in some cases)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dehydration (due to diarrhea)
* Electrolyte imbalance (especially with prolonged use or in individuals with pre-existing conditions)

**Rare but more serious side effects** may occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* Rectal bleeding
* Severe abdominal pain
* Signs of dehydration (excessive thirst, dizziness, decreased urination)

**How it Works:**  This combination medication utilizes two different mechanisms to relieve constipation:

* **Sodium Picosulfate:** This is a stimulant laxative. It works by stimulating the nerves in the intestines, increasing the movement of the bowels and promoting the passage of stool.

* **Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia):** This is an osmotic laxative. It draws water into the intestines, softening the stool and making it easier to pass. The increased water volume also stimulates bowel movements.
