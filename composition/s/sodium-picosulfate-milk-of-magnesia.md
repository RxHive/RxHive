# Sodium Picosulfate + Milk of Magnesia
### Generic Name
Sodium Picosulfate + Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia)


### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used as a bowel evacuant to cleanse the bowel before medical procedures such as colonoscopy or other bowel examinations.  The sodium picosulfate stimulates bowel movements by increasing intestinal motility, while the magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia) acts as an osmotic laxative, drawing water into the intestines to soften the stool and promote easier passage.  It's crucial to understand that this is not a treatment for chronic constipation; it's for single-episode bowel preparation.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific product and the physician's instructions.  Always follow the prescribing healthcare professional's guidelines.  Generally, adults will be given a specific dose, often taken as a single dose the evening before a procedure, or divided doses over a short period, as directed.  Specific instructions will be provided based on the type of procedure and individual patient needs.  This medication is not typically recommended for children without explicit guidance from a pediatrician.  There is no standard pediatric dosage available over the counter; always consult a doctor before using this on children.  Intravenous administration is not applicable for this combination.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Abdominal cramping
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dehydration (especially with prolonged or excessive use)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Rectal bleeding
* Severe abdominal pain
* Electrolyte imbalances (particularly with prolonged or excessive use)

**If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.**


### How it Works
Sodium picosulfate is a stimulant laxative. It works by stimulating the nerves in the intestines, increasing the contractions and movement of the bowels, promoting bowel evacuation.  Magnesium hydroxide, or Milk of Magnesia, is an osmotic laxative.  It draws water into the intestines, softening the stool and making it easier to pass. The combination of these two agents ensures both efficient bowel emptying and stool softening.
