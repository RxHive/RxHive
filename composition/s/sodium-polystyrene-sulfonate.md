# Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate
### Generic Name
Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate

### Usage
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is primarily used to treat hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by high levels of potassium in the blood.  It's a potassium binder, meaning it works within the digestive system to remove potassium from the body.  It's crucial to understand that because of its delayed onset of action, it's not suitable for emergency treatment of life-threatening hyperkalemia; faster-acting treatments are necessary in such situations.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Hyperkalemia):**

* **Oral:** 15 grams 1-4 times daily.
* **Rectal:** 30-50 grams every 6 hours.

**Pediatric Dosage (Hyperkalemia):**  Dosage is complex and varies significantly based on the child's weight and the method of administration (oral, nasogastric tube, or rectal).  Always follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  Generally, dosing is calculated in grams per kilogram of body weight per dose, with maximum doses varying depending on the route and age.  Some pediatric dosing is also based on an exchange ratio (1 mEq K+/g of sodium polystyrene sulfonate resin), aiming to bind a specific amount of potassium.  Treating infant formula or expressed breast milk to reduce potassium load in renal failure also requires weight-based or exchange ratio-based calculations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  Similarly, adjustments aren't usually necessary for those with renal (kidney) impairment, as the drug isn't significantly absorbed into the bloodstream.  However, the healthcare provider must carefully monitor the patient's potassium levels.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These can include nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, anorexia (loss of appetite).

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but more serious and require immediate medical attention.  They include:

* Bezoar formation (a mass of undigested material in the stomach or intestines)
* Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding
* GI ulcers
* Intestinal necrosis (tissue death)
* Intestinal perforation (a hole in the intestinal wall)
* Ischemic colitis (inflammation of the colon due to reduced blood flow)
* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels)
* Hypocalcemia (low calcium levels)
* Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels)
* Sodium retention (the body holds onto excess sodium)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider promptly.

### How it Works

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation-exchange resin.  It works in the intestines, primarily the large intestine.  It exchanges sodium ions for potassium ions, effectively trapping potassium within the resin. This potassium-laden resin is then eliminated from the body through the stool, reducing the potassium level in the blood.  The exchange capacity is approximately 1 mEq of potassium per 1 g of resin *in vivo*, although *in vitro* capacity is higher. This highlights the importance of close monitoring of serum potassium levels.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Sodium polystyrene sulfonate should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug, obstructive bowel disease, or neonates with reduced gut motility.  Oral administration is contraindicated in neonates, and rectal administration is contraindicated in neonates for sorbitol-containing formulations.


**Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of aspiration (especially with oral or nasogastric administration), severe hypokalemia (low potassium), fecal impaction, intestinal necrosis, and other serious gastrointestinal events. It can also bind to other orally administered medications, potentially affecting their absorption and effectiveness. Use caution in patients with severe heart failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), edema (swelling), renal impairment, and in premature or low-birth-weight infants. Rectal administration should also be used with caution in children.

**Drug Interactions:**  Sodium polystyrene sulfonate may interact with several medications, including lithium, thyroid products, aluminum hydroxide, digoxin, antacids, magnesium-containing laxatives, meloxicam, and sorbitol.  Consult a healthcare professional to assess potential interactions if taking other medications.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is considered a Category C drug during pregnancy.  However, because it isn't absorbed systemically, maternal use isn't expected to harm the fetus. Similarly, breastfeeding mothers can generally use it safely as the drug isn't absorbed systemically by the mother.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for sodium polystyrene sulfonate to work?** A:  The effects can take hours to days to become fully apparent, depending on the dosage and the individual's response.
* **Q: Can I take sodium polystyrene sulfonate with other medications?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist. Several potential interactions exist, necessitating careful consideration.
* **Q: How should I store sodium polystyrene sulfonate?** A: Store as directed on the product label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: Is sodium polystyrene sulfonate a cure for hyperkalemia?** A: No, it's a treatment to manage high potassium levels.  The underlying cause of hyperkalemia needs to be addressed.
* **Q: What are the symptoms of hyperkalemia?** A: Symptoms can include muscle weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, irregular heartbeat.
