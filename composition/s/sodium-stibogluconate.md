# Sodium Stibogluconate
### Generic Name
Sodium Stibogluconate

### Usage
Sodium stibogluconate is an antiprotozoal medication primarily used to treat leishmaniasis, a disease caused by parasites of the *Leishmania* genus.  It's effective against both cutaneous (skin) and visceral (internal organs) forms of leishmaniasis.  While it's sometimes used as an alternative treatment for visceral leishmaniasis, other medications are generally preferred, particularly in pregnant women.  The choice of treatment depends on the specific type and severity of leishmaniasis, as well as the patient's overall health.

### Dosage

**Leishmaniasis:**

* **Adults and Children:** The usual dose is 20 mg/kg per day, administered either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).  The treatment duration varies.  For cutaneous leishmaniasis, a 20-day course is typical, while visceral leishmaniasis usually requires 28 days of treatment.  Patients with HIV infection may require a longer course (28 days for cutaneous leishmaniasis).  In some cases, particularly for individuals with visceral leishmaniasis and a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/mmÂ³, a chronic maintenance therapy of 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks may be considered.

* **Administration:** IV administration is generally preferred over IM injection because the IM route can be painful due to the relatively large injection volume.  If administered intravenously, it should be given slowly over 5-10 minutes.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Sodium stibogluconate should be avoided in patients with significant hepatic (liver) impairment and is contraindicated in those with significant renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Lethargy
* Malaise

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Frequency not always defined or less than 1%):**

* Abnormal EKG findings (flattened or inverted T-waves, QT prolongation)
* Increased amylase levels (indicating possible pancreatic involvement)
* Abdominal pain
* Anorexia
* Increased serum lipase levels
* Changes in blood counts (decreased platelets, hemoglobin, or white blood cells)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Cough
* Pneumonia
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Facial flushing
* Fever
* Hemorrhage (nosebleeds or bleeding gums)
* Jaundice
* Pancreatitis
* Rigors (shaking chills)
* Skin rash
* Substernal pain (chest pain)
* Vertigo (dizziness)

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Sodium stibogluconate is converted in the body to pentavalent antimony, which is then reduced to the active trivalent form.  This trivalent antimony interferes with several crucial metabolic processes in the *Leishmania* parasite, including glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and ATP (energy) production.  By disrupting these essential functions, the drug ultimately leads to the parasite's death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sodium stibogluconate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, significant renal impairment, and breastfeeding women.

* **Increased Risk:** This medication carries an increased risk of altered cardiac conduction, hematologic effects (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), hepatotoxicity (liver damage), musculoskeletal effects (arthralgias and myalgias), and pancreatitis.

* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using sodium stibogluconate in elderly patients.  Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease should avoid its use. Iron deficiency needs correction before starting treatment.  This drug should be used cautiously in pregnancy.  Other agents are generally preferred during pregnancy.

* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific interactions aren't extensively documented, it's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking to assess potential interactions.


### FAQs

**Q: How is sodium stibogluconate stored?**  A: Follow the storage instructions on the medication's label.  Generally, it should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Is sodium stibogluconate safe for pregnant women?** A:  No, other medications are generally preferred for visceral leishmaniasis in pregnancy due to the increased risk of spontaneous abortion associated with sodium stibogluconate.

**Q: Can I breastfeed while taking sodium stibogluconate?** A: No, breastfeeding is contraindicated while taking this medication because it's excreted in breast milk.

**Q: How long does it take to see results from sodium stibogluconate treatment?** A:  The response to treatment varies depending on the type and severity of leishmaniasis.  Your healthcare provider will monitor your progress through regular check-ups.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
