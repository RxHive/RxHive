# Sotorasib
### Generic Name
Sotorasib

### Usage
Sotorasib is a targeted therapy used to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  It's specifically indicated for patients whose tumors have a *KRAS G12C* mutation, as confirmed by an FDA-approved test.  This means the drug works against a specific genetic abnormality driving the cancer's growth.  The medication is generally used after at least one other systemic therapy has been tried.  Currently, there are no approved uses of Sotorasib in children or for other types of cancer.


### Dosage
The typical adult dosage is 960 mg once daily (OD) orally.  This dose is continued until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual factors.  

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild hepatic impairment (slightly elevated liver enzymes), no dosage adjustment is typically needed.  However, in cases of moderate to severe impairment, the prescribing physician will need to carefully consider the risks and benefits of treatment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Generally, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment.  Severe kidney impairment might require adjustments, determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician.
* **Adverse Reactions:**  If significant side effects occur (e.g., severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes), the dose may be reduced in steps (480 mg OD, then 240 mg OD). Treatment might be stopped if side effects are unmanageable, even at the lowest dose.
* **Pediatric Use:**  Sotorasib's safety and effectiveness have not been established in children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Edema (swelling)
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Decreased levels of serum albumin, calcium, and sodium
* Increased urinary protein
* Decreased hemoglobin levels
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Prolonged partial thromboplastin time (a blood clotting test)
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP)
* Increased serum bilirubin
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Pneumonia

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (<1% of patients) can include:

* Gastric ulcer
* Cardiac failure
* Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis
* Respiratory failure

If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Sotorasib is a KRAS G12C inhibitor.  KRAS is a protein involved in cell growth and division. The G12C mutation is a specific alteration in this protein, common in some cancers, that makes it constantly active, promoting uncontrolled cell growth.  Sotorasib works by binding directly to the mutated KRAS G12C protein, preventing it from sending signals that stimulate cancer cell growth. This effectively shuts down the cancer's growth pathway without affecting the normal, non-mutated KRAS protein.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** There are currently no specific contraindications listed for Sotorasib, but individual patient factors need to be considered.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Sotorasib's interaction with other medications can affect its effectiveness or increase side effects.  Avoid using it with acid-reducing agents (proton-pump inhibitors, H2 blockers), strong CYP3A4 inducers, certain CYP3A4 substrates, and some P-glycoprotein substrates without consulting your doctor.
* **Hepatotoxicity and ILD/Pneumonitis:** Sotorasib can cause liver damage (hepatotoxicity) and lung problems (interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis).  Regular monitoring of liver function and close attention to any respiratory symptoms are crucial.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Sotorasib should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients with pre-existing liver or lung conditions should be carefully monitored.  Close monitoring of blood counts is also recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is the *KRAS G12C* mutation determined?** A: This is done through a specific FDA-approved test on a tumor sample (biopsy) or sometimes a blood sample.
* **Q: Can I take Sotorasib with food?** A: Yes, Sotorasib can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose by more than 6 hours, skip the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled. Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: How is Sotorasib stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. Typically, it involves storing it at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent.
