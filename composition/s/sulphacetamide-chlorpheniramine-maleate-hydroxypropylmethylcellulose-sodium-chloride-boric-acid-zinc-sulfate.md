# Sulphacetamide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + Sodium Chloride + Boric Acid + Zinc Sulfate

This combination of Sulphacetamide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + Sodium Chloride + Boric Acid + Zinc Sulfate is typically found in ophthalmic solutions (eye drops).  It's crucial to note that I cannot provide medical advice, and the information below is for general knowledge only.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using any medication, especially eye drops.  This specific combination is not a standard, widely available formulation, and the exact properties might vary slightly depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.

**Generic Name:**  Sulphacetamide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + Sodium Chloride + Boric Acid + Zinc Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution

**Usage:** This combination is likely intended for the treatment of certain types of eye infections and allergies.  

* **Sulphacetamide:** An antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eye.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps reduce allergic reactions such as itching and swelling.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** A viscosity-increasing agent, acting as a lubricant and thickening agent to improve comfort and prolong contact time in the eye.
* **Sodium Chloride:**  Helps to maintain the osmotic balance of the solution, making it compatible with the eye's natural environment.
* **Boric Acid:**  A mild antiseptic and buffering agent, helping to adjust the pH of the solution.
* **Zinc Sulfate:** May have an astringent effect, helping to reduce swelling and inflammation.

The specific indications will depend on the formulation and prescribing information from a doctor.  It might be used for conditions like bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) with an allergic component.


**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye.
* Temporary blurring of vision.
* Eye redness or irritation.
* Allergic reactions (rare but possible).  These could manifest as increased itching, swelling, or rash.

This is not an exhaustive list.  More serious side effects are possible, though rare.


**How it Works:**

* **Sulphacetamide:**  Works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria, thereby treating the infection.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, thus relieving symptoms like itching and swelling.
* The other ingredients contribute to the formulation's stability, comfort, and effectiveness.
