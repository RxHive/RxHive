# Saw Palmetto
### Generic Name
Saw Palmetto

### Usage
Saw palmetto is primarily used to alleviate symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlargement of the prostate gland.  While it has been traditionally used for this purpose, the scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness is limited and ongoing research is needed to fully understand its benefits.  It's important to note that saw palmetto is not a treatment for prostate cancer.  It should not be considered a replacement for medical advice and treatment from a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for treating BPH is 320 mg per day of a standardized extract. This is usually taken orally.  There's limited information on appropriate dosages for children, and its use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response.


### Side Effects
While generally considered well-tolerated, saw palmetto can potentially cause several side effects, although the frequency of these occurrences isn't consistently defined in research. Possible side effects include:

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Fatigue
*   Abdominal pain
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Changes in ejaculation or erectile function
*   Reduced libido
*   Urinary retention
*   Skin reactions (pruritus)
*   Muscle pain


In rare cases, more serious side effects such as cholestatic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) have been reported.  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
The precise mechanism by which saw palmetto works isn't fully understood. It's believed to possibly exert anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects (meaning it may inhibit the growth and promote the death of certain cells) within the prostate.  This may involve influencing the activity of growth factors and adipocyte (fat cell) differentiation. However, more research is necessary to fully elucidate its mechanism of action.


### Precautions
* **Interactions:** Saw palmetto might interact with blood-thinning medications such as warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin.  Consult your doctor before using saw palmetto if you are on any other medication, especially those affecting blood clotting.
