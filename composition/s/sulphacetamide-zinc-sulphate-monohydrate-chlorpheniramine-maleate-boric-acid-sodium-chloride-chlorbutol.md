# Sulphacetamide + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Boric Acid + Sodium Chloride + Chlorbutol

This combination of ingredients is commonly found in ophthalmic solutions (eye drops) used to treat various eye infections and irritations.  It's important to note that this is not a single drug, but a combination.  The precise ratios of each ingredient will vary depending on the specific brand and formulation.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using any medication, especially eye drops.**

**Generic Name:**  This isn't a single generic name because it's a combination drug.  Each ingredient has its own:

* **Sulfacetamide:** A sulfonamide antibiotic
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** An astringent and antimicrobial
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine
* **Boric Acid:** An antiseptic and buffering agent
* **Sodium Chloride:**  An electrolyte, helps maintain tonicity (similar to the salt content of tears)
* **Chlorbutol (Chlorobutanol):** A preservative


**Usage:** This combination eye drop is typically used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye), blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), and other minor eye infections and irritations characterized by redness, itching, swelling, and discharge.  The specific indications may vary depending on the manufacturer's labeling.


**Side Effects:**  Possible side effects can include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation** upon application.  This is fairly common and usually temporary.
* **Allergic reactions:**  These are possible, ranging from mild itching to more serious reactions.  Stop use and seek medical attention if you experience a severe reaction.
* **Eye irritation:** Redness, dryness, or discomfort.
* **Blurred vision:** Temporary.
* **Headache** (less common)
* **Other less common side effects** may occur and vary depending on individual sensitivity to the ingredients.


**How it Works:**

* **Sulfacetamide:** Kills or inhibits the growth of bacteria causing the infection.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** Reduces inflammation and has some antimicrobial properties.  It also helps to dry up excess discharge.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Relieves itching and allergic symptoms associated with inflammation.
* **Boric Acid:** Provides antiseptic action and helps maintain the pH balance of the eye drops.
* **Sodium Chloride:** Maintains the osmotic balance of the solution, making it compatible with the eye's natural environment.
* **Chlorbutol:** Acts as a preservative to prevent contamination and extend the shelf life of the solution.
