# Sulphacetamide + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Boric Acid + Sodium Chloride + Chlorbutol
### Generic Name:  Sulphacetamide + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Boric Acid + Sodium Chloride + Chlorbutol (Combination Eye Drop)


Note:  This combination is not a single, universally named generic medicine.  It represents a combination of several active ingredients frequently found together in ophthalmic (eye) solutions. The specific brand name and exact formulation will vary by manufacturer.  The information below is general and may not apply to every product containing this combination. Always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate details.

### Usage

This combination eye drop is primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye),  and other bacterial infections of the eye. The individual components work synergistically:

* **Sulphacetamide:** A sulfa antibiotic effective against a range of bacteria causing eye infections.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Possesses astringent and antiseptic properties, helping to reduce inflammation and discharge.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps relieve itching and allergic reactions associated with eye infections.
* **Boric Acid:** Acts as a mild antiseptic and buffer, helping to maintain the eye's pH balance.
* **Sodium Chloride:** Maintains the isotonicity (similar salt concentration to tears) of the solution, making it comfortable for the eye.
* **Chlorbutol:** A preservative that helps prevent bacterial contamination of the solution.


The specific conditions treated may vary depending on the exact formulation and the prescribing physician's judgment.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary greatly depending on the specific product and the condition being treated.  **Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or the medication label precisely.**  Typically, one or two drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) several times a day.  This is usually for a duration of 7-10 days or as directed by your healthcare provider.  

There are no specific pediatric or adult dosage differences explicitly established for this combination. However, children may require adjusted dosage based on the physician's evaluation.  IV administration is not applicable for this topical eye medication.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Mild burning or stinging sensation upon application.
* Temporary blurred vision.
* Eye redness or irritation.
* Allergic reactions (rare, but possible, including skin rash or swelling).

Less common, but more serious side effects could include:

* Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis): This is rare but requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* Worsening of eye infection: If the infection doesn't improve or gets worse, contact your doctor immediately.

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are unusual or persistent, contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

This combination medication works through the combined actions of its components:

* **Sulphacetamide:** Interferes with bacterial folic acid synthesis, essential for bacterial growth and survival, thereby inhibiting bacterial replication.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Reduces inflammation by constricting blood vessels and possesses mild antiseptic properties to further control infection.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing inflammation and the allergic response, including itching and redness.
* **Boric Acid, Sodium Chloride, and Chlorbutol:** Serve as adjuvants to enhance the effectiveness and safety of the primary active components.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not use this medication if you are allergic to any of its components (sulfonamides, zinc, chlorpheniramine, boric acid, etc.).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as there might be interactions.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying the drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Temporary blurred vision may occur. Avoid driving or operating machinery until your vision clears.
* **Storage:** Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
