# Sucralfate
### Generic Name
Sucralfate

### Usage
Sucralfate is primarily used to treat and protect duodenal ulcers.  It works by forming a protective barrier over the ulcer, shielding it from the damaging effects of stomach acid, pepsin (a digestive enzyme), and bile salts. This allows the ulcer to heal naturally.  While its primary use is for active duodenal ulcers, sucralfate has also seen off-label use in preventing stress ulcers (ulcers that develop due to severe illness or injury) and treating mouth sores (stomatitis).  However, the effectiveness of sucralfate in these off-label uses requires further study and should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Duodenal Ulcer (Active):** The typical dose is 1 gram (g) four times a day (QID) on an empty stomach, usually for 4-8 weeks.  Maintenance therapy may involve 1 g twice a day (BID) for up to a year, but this should be determined by a doctor.  Sucralfate is available in tablet and suspension forms.
* **Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis (Off-Label):** 1 g QID for 4-8 weeks.
* **Stomatitis (Off-Label):** For the suspension (1 g per 10 mL), 10 mL QID.

**Children:**

The safety and effectiveness of sucralfate in children have not been established.  Off-label use in children, under strict medical supervision, may involve doses adjusted by weight.  For example, for active duodenal ulcers, a dose of 10-20 mg/kg in four divided doses might be considered, but this should only be prescribed by a pediatrician experienced in managing pediatric ulcers.  For stomatitis, 5-10 mL of the suspension (1 g/10 mL) QID may be used, again only under direct medical guidance.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, because sucralfate contains aluminum, caution is advised in patients with chronic renal failure as aluminum can accumulate.

### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Constipation
* **Less Common (<1%, Post-marketing and/or Case Reports):** Anaphylaxis, back pain, bezoar formation (a mass of indigestible material in the stomach), bronchospasm, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dyspepsia (indigestion), facial edema (swelling), flatulence, gastric distress, headache, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), hypersensitivity reactions, insomnia, laryngeal edema (swelling of the voice box), mouth edema, nausea, pharyngeal edema (swelling of the throat), pruritus (itching), pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), skin rash, vertigo, vomiting, and xerostomia (dry mouth).

If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Sucralfate works by binding to the proteins in the ulcer's base, creating a protective layer. This protective barrier acts as a shield, preventing stomach acid, pepsin, and bile salts from further damaging the ulcer bed. This allows the ulcer to heal more effectively.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sucralfate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with renal impairment are at an increased risk of aluminum accumulation and toxicity.
* **Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with renal impairment, diabetes (due to the potential for hyperglycemia), difficulty swallowing (for tablet formulations), and in older adults (due to potentially reduced renal function). Sucralfate may reduce the absorption of certain medications, such as tetracyclines, ranitidine, ketoconazole, theophylline, phenytoin, cimetidine, and digoxin.  These medications should not be taken concurrently with sucralfate without consulting a doctor.  


### FAQs

* **Q: When should I take sucralfate?**  A: Sucralfate should be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before meals and at bedtime.
* **Q: Can I take antacids with sucralfate?** A:  No, antacids should not be taken within half an hour before or after sucralfate.
* **Q:  How long does it take for sucralfate to work?** A:  The time it takes for sucralfate to show effects varies, but it generally starts to work relatively quickly, protecting the ulcer from further damage. Complete healing may take several weeks.
* **Q: Can sucralfate be crushed or chewed?** A: Sucralfate tablets can be broken or crushed, or dissolved in water if needed, especially for those who have difficulty swallowing.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store sucralfate?** A: Store sucralfate at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
