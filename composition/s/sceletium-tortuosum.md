# Sceletium Tortuosum
### Generic Name
Sceletium Tortuosum Extract

### Usage

Sceletium tortuosum extract is derived from a succulent plant native to South Africa.  Traditionally, it has been used to elevate mood, reduce anxiety, stress, and tension, and suppress appetite.  It's important to note that while these traditional uses exist, the scientific evidence supporting these effects is currently limited, and further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.  Therefore, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using Sceletium tortuosum for any medical condition.  Currently, there is no widespread clinical use of this extract for treating specific diseases.


### Dosage

There is no established standardized dosage for Sceletium tortuosum extract.  The appropriate dose can vary greatly depending on the specific product, its concentration of active compounds, and the individual's response.  Dosage information is often provided by the manufacturer on the product label, but it is always best to follow a healthcare professional's recommendations.  Different forms of the extract may exist, such as capsules, powders, or tinctures; dosage instructions will vary depending on the form.  The use of Sceletium tortuosum extract in children, pregnant women, or breastfeeding mothers is not well-studied and should be avoided unless specifically advised by a medical professional.


### Side Effects

While generally considered well-tolerated in low doses, potential side effects of Sceletium tortuosum extract may include:

* Mild nausea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Mild gastrointestinal upset

Serious side effects are rare, but potential interactions with other medications are possible.  If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

The precise mechanism of action of Sceletium tortuosum extract is not fully understood, but research suggests it may involve several pathways:

* **Serotonin Reuptake Inhibition (SSRI-like activity):** It's proposed that the extract may inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, a neurotransmitter crucial for mood regulation.  This effect may contribute to its mood-enhancing properties.
* **Other potential mechanisms:**  Other proposed mechanisms of action include interactions with other neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain, although more research is needed to confirm these actions.


### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:**  Because Sceletium tortuosum extract may affect neurotransmitters, it's crucial to discuss its use with a healthcare provider if you are taking other medications, especially antidepressants or other central nervous system drugs.  Potential interactions may occur.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of Sceletium tortuosum extract during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended due to a lack of safety data.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Individuals with liver or kidney disease should use caution and consult with their doctor before considering Sceletium tortuosum, as its metabolism and excretion may be affected.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.  Discontinue use immediately if an allergic reaction occurs.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Be cautious if driving or operating machinery, as some individuals may experience dizziness or drowsiness.
