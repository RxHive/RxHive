# Siltuximab
### Generic Name
Siltuximab

### Usage
Siltuximab is a medication used to treat multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) in adults who are HIV-negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)-negative.  MCD is a rare disorder causing enlargement of lymph nodes throughout the body, leading to various symptoms depending on the severity.  Siltuximab's primary role is to manage the symptoms and potentially control disease progression in these patients. It's important to note that siltuximab hasn't been studied in patients with MCD who are HIV-positive or HHV-8-positive because it doesn't bind to the virally produced interleukin-6 (IL-6).


### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical intravenous (IV) dose is 11 mg/kg administered once every three weeks until the treatment is no longer effective.  For patients with severe disease who are critically ill, an off-label regimen may be considered, starting with a weekly dose of 11 mg/kg for the first month, followed by the standard every-three-weeks schedule.  Initial disease control often includes adjunctive corticosteroids (for 4-8 weeks, then tapered), especially for symptomatic patients who might require higher initial corticosteroid doses and a more gradual taper.  The physician will determine the appropriate corticosteroid regimen.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of siltuximab in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B), or for renal impairment (creatinine clearance â‰¥15 mL/min).  For severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) or creatinine clearance <15 mL/min, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), dosage adjustments aren't specified in the manufacturer's labeling and should be determined by a physician considering the patient's overall health.  If hematologic toxicity (low white blood cell count, low platelet count, or high hemoglobin) occurs, treatment may be delayed until blood counts improve.  Severe reactions such as anaphylaxis or severe infusion reactions necessitate permanent discontinuation of siltuximab.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Edema (swelling)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Weight gain
* Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels in the blood)
* Upper respiratory tract infection

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Constipation
* Eczema, psoriasis, skin hyperpigmentation, xeroderma (dry skin)
* Hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides), hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Antibody development
* Renal insufficiency (reduced kidney function)
* Lower respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain
* Infusion-related reactions


**Rare Side Effects (<1%):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Siltuximab can mask signs of infection and inflammation, potentially delaying diagnosis and treatment. GI perforation is another potential serious risk.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Siltuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-6 (IL-6), a protein involved in inflammation and immune responses.  In MCD, excessive IL-6 production contributes to the disease's symptoms. Siltuximab binds to IL-6, preventing it from binding to its receptors and thus reducing its activity. This helps to decrease inflammation and improve symptoms associated with MCD.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Siltuximab is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to siltuximab or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:** Siltuximab can mask signs of infection and inflammation.  Patients should be monitored for signs of infection, and live vaccines should be avoided during treatment.  Patients at increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation should be treated cautiously.  Infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur.  The medication may interact with other drugs, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting treatment.  Pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before using this medication.  Breastfeeding mothers should consult their doctor, as it is unknown whether the medication is excreted in human milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is siltuximab administered?**  A: Siltuximab is given intravenously (IV) over one hour.  Specific administration instructions should be followed carefully.

* **Q: How long does treatment with siltuximab last?** A: Treatment continues until it is no longer effective in controlling the disease.  This is determined by your physician based on your response to treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: How should I store siltuximab?** A:  Storage instructions will be provided with the medication.  Generally, medications should be stored as directed by your healthcare professional or the manufacturer's instructions.

* **Q:  Can I receive vaccinations while taking siltuximab?** A: No, live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with siltuximab.  Discuss vaccination schedules with your doctor.
