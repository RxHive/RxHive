# Sevelamer

**Generic Name:** Sevelamer

**Usage:**

Sevelamer is used to control serum phosphorus levels in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on dialysis.  It's specifically indicated for hyperphosphatemia (high phosphorus levels in the blood) associated with CKD.  It's not a treatment for CKD itself, but manages a significant complication of the disease.


**Side Effects:**

Sevelamer, like all medications, can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Constipation (very common), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness.


Rare but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* **Intestinal obstruction or perforation:** While rare, this is a serious potential complication.
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions, such as rash, itching, or swelling.


It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to your doctor or pharmacist.


**How it Works:**

Sevelamer is a non-absorbable phosphate binder.  This means it works in the gastrointestinal tract to bind to phosphate (phosphorus) in food. This bound phosphate is then eliminated from the body through the stool, preventing it from being absorbed into the bloodstream.  By reducing phosphate absorption, sevelamer helps lower serum phosphorus levels and prevents the complications associated with hyperphosphatemia.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is sevelamer taken?**  A: Sevelamer is usually taken orally with meals. The dosage and frequency are determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and phosphorus levels.

* **Q:  Can I take sevelamer with other medications?** A:  Sevelamer can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.  Some medications, particularly certain types of medications affecting calcium and vitamin D absorption, may need dose adjustments.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of taking sevelamer?** A:  Long-term use of sevelamer is generally safe, but regular monitoring of phosphorus levels and overall health is essential.  Your doctor will monitor for potential side effects and adjust the dosage as needed.

* **Q:  Can sevelamer cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies?** A:  While sevelamer primarily binds phosphate, it can theoretically bind other substances to a smaller degree.  Your doctor may recommend monitoring vitamin D and calcium levels, and may prescribe supplements if deficiencies are detected.
