# Sevelamer
### Generic Name
Sevelamer

### Usage
Sevelamer is primarily used to control high levels of phosphorus in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) in adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are undergoing dialysis.  It works by binding to phosphorus in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. This is crucial because high phosphorus levels can lead to serious complications in individuals with CKD, such as bone disease and cardiovascular problems.  While its main use is in dialysis patients, it may be considered in non-dialysis CKD patients with uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The initial dosage for controlling serum phosphorus levels varies depending on the individual's phosphorus levels.  Generally, it begins at 800-1600 mg three times a day (TID) with meals. The dose is then adjusted based on the patient's response, typically every 2 weeks, to reach a target phosphorus level of 3.5-5.5 mg/dL.  The maximum dose is typically around 13g/day (Sevelamer hydrochloride) or 14g/day (Sevelamer carbonate).  The medication comes in tablets or capsules.

**Children (≥6 years):**  Dosage for children is determined by body surface area (BSA).  Those with a BSA of ≥0.75 to <1.2 m² usually start at 800 mg TID with meals, while those with a BSA ≥1.2 m² typically begin at 1600 mg TID with meals. Dosage adjustments are made in 400mg or 800mg increments every two weeks as needed, based on phosphorus levels.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, although careful monitoring is necessary.  Dosage adjustments are primarily based on the patient's serum phosphorus levels.  When switching from calcium acetate to Sevelamer, dose conversion should be done under medical supervision using established equivalence ratios (e.g., 667 mg calcium acetate ≈ 800 mg Sevelamer carbonate).

**Important Note:** All dosage adjustments should be made under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Regular blood tests to monitor phosphorus levels are necessary to ensure effective and safe treatment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Flatulence

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Metabolic acidosis (build-up of acid in the blood)
* Bowel obstruction
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)


If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as serious, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Sevelamer is a non-absorbable phosphate binder.  This means it doesn't get absorbed into the bloodstream. Instead, it works in the intestines.  It binds to phosphorus in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption into the body. This effectively lowers the level of phosphorus in the blood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sevelamer is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to sevelamer or any of its components and those with bowel obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Sevelamer can interact with several medications, including certain antibiotics (quinolones), levothyroxine (thyroid hormone), cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and calcitriol.  Administering these medications at different times of day from sevelamer may be necessary.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies being taken.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While sevelamer is not absorbed systemically, it may affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.  Healthcare providers should monitor pregnant women and provide necessary supplementation. Sevelamer is generally considered safe for use during breastfeeding as it is not believed to be excreted in breast milk.
* **Gastrointestinal Issues:**  Sevelamer should be used with caution in individuals with existing gastrointestinal disorders, as it can worsen certain conditions.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of serum phosphorus levels, along with other electrolytes and blood chemistries (including bicarbonate, calcium, and kidney function markers), is crucial during treatment with sevelamer.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Sevelamer without a prescription?**

A: No. Sevelamer is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Q: How should I store Sevelamer?**

A: Store Sevelamer as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose to catch up.

**Q: Can Sevelamer cause weight loss or gain?**

A:  Weight changes are not typically reported as a common side effect of Sevelamer. However, any significant weight changes should be reported to your doctor.

**Q: How long will I need to take Sevelamer?**

A: The duration of treatment depends on the individual's condition and response to therapy. It's determined by your doctor.
