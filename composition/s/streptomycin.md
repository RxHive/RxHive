# Streptomycin
### Generic Name
Streptomycin

### Usage
Streptomycin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic primarily used to treat serious bacterial infections.  Its main applications are in treating mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis (TB), particularly when other TB drugs are ineffective or the infection is resistant.  It's also used in some cases of brucellosis (an infection caused by bacteria found in animals) and certain types of endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), usually in combination with other antibiotics.  Off-label uses include treating infections caused by  *Mycobacterium avium* complex (MAC), *Mycobacterium kansasii*, *Mycobacterium ulcerans* (Buruli ulcer), plague, and tularemia.  These off-label uses often involve situations where other treatment options have failed or are not suitable.  It's crucial to understand that streptomycin is generally reserved for severe infections and is often part of a combination therapy regimen, rarely used alone.


### Dosage
Streptomycin dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  Dosage information provided here is for informational purposes only and should not replace the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults:**  The usual dosage range is 15-30 mg/kg/day, given either intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). This total daily dose may be divided into single daily doses or divided into multiple doses throughout the day, depending on the specific treatment plan.  The maximum daily dose is often 1 gram, but this can vary based on the specific indication and the patient's condition.  For specific dosing information for individual infections (brucellosis, endocarditis, tuberculosis, etc.), consult the detailed prescribing information in the provided text.

**Children:** Pediatric dosing is also weight-based and varies depending on the infection being treated. It's typically calculated as 20-40 mg/kg/day, divided into doses given every 6-12 hours. Again, maximum doses exist and should be strictly adhered to.  Specific dosage instructions for children with different infections are detailed in the provided information.


**Administration:** Intramuscular (IM) injection is a common route of administration. IV administration is also used in some cases and requires dilution before infusion over 30-60 minutes.  The instructions for administering streptomycin must be followed precisely.

### Side Effects
Streptomycin, like many antibiotics, can cause side effects.  These vary in frequency and severity.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drug fever
* Skin rash

**Serious, but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Hearing loss (ototoxicity)
* Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
* Nerve damage (neurotoxicity)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Blood disorders

**Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Streptomycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic (it inhibits bacterial growth). It works by binding to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes. This binding interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, effectively stopping the bacteria from producing essential proteins for growth and survival. This eventually leads to bacterial cell death.


### Precautions
Streptomycin should be used with caution in several situations:

* **Allergy:** Streptomycin should not be used in individuals with a known allergy to streptomycin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
* **Renal Impairment:** Streptomycin is excreted primarily through the kidneys, so dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with reduced kidney function to prevent toxic buildup.  Careful monitoring of kidney function is crucial during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Streptomycin is a Category D drug during pregnancy, meaning it poses a potential risk to the fetus. It is also excreted in breast milk.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh the risks, under the strict supervision of a physician.
* **Neuromuscular Disorders:** Streptomycin can potentially worsen neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis.
* **Hearing Impairment:** Streptomycin can damage the hearing, so patients with pre-existing hearing problems should be monitored closely during treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Streptomycin can interact with other drugs, including other aminoglycosides, diuretics, and neuromuscular blocking agents.  Your healthcare provider needs to be aware of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for streptomycin to work?** A: The time it takes to see improvement depends on the infection being treated and the overall health of the individual.  Improvement may be observed within days to weeks.

* **Q: How is streptomycin stored?** A: Streptomycin should be stored as directed by your pharmacist. Generally, it should be kept at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking streptomycin if I feel better?** A: No.  It's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment, even if you feel better, to prevent the infection from returning and to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance on what to do if you miss a dose.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking streptomycin?** A: While rare, long-term effects could include hearing loss or kidney damage.  Regular monitoring during and after treatment can help identify and manage any such issues.
