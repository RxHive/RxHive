# Streptomycin

**Generic Name:** Streptomycin

**Usage:** Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative bacteria.  It's often used in combination with other antibiotics for treating:

* **Tuberculosis (TB):**  Especially in cases of drug-resistant TB.  It's usually part of a multi-drug regimen.
* **Endocarditis:** Infection of the inner lining of the heart.
* **Pneumonia:** Severe pneumonia caused by specific bacteria.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infection):**  In severe cases where other antibiotics are ineffective.
* **Meningitis:**  Infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (though less common now due to better alternatives).
* **Plague:** Caused by *Yersinia pestis*.
* **Tularemia:** Caused by *Francisella tularensis*.


**Side Effects:** Streptomycin, like other aminoglycosides, can cause several side effects, some mild and others serious.  These include:

* **Hearing loss:** This is a potentially irreversible side effect and a major concern, especially with prolonged use or high doses.  It can range from mild tinnitus (ringing in the ears) to complete deafness.
* **Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity):**  Can lead to reduced kidney function or even kidney failure.
* **Vestibular toxicity:** Affecting balance and coordination.  Can cause dizziness, vertigo, and nausea.
* **Nerve damage (neuropathy):**  Can cause numbness, tingling, or weakness in the extremities.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These are relatively common, usually mild and often resolved with adjustments to dosage or timing.


**How it Works:** Streptomycin works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria. This interferes with protein synthesis in bacterial cells, ultimately leading to bacterial death.  It's bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria directly.


**FAQs:**

* **Is streptomycin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  No, streptomycin should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks to the fetus or infant.  The drug can cross the placenta and enter breast milk.

* **How is streptomycin administered?**  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM) injection, as oral absorption is poor.

* **What are the drug interactions?**  Streptomycin can interact with other nephrotoxic drugs (those that can damage the kidneys), such as vancomycin or amphotericin B.  It can also interact with certain diuretics. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **How long is the treatment course?**  The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection and its severity.  It can range from a few weeks to several months, often in conjunction with other antibiotics.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects, particularly hearing loss, dizziness, or changes in urination.
