# Sumatriptan (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Sumatriptan (Nasal)

### Usage

Sumatriptan is a triptan medication, specifically a 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonist. Its primary use is for the acute treatment of migraine headaches, both with and without aura.  It's crucial to remember that sumatriptan is only used *after* a migraine diagnosis has been confirmed by a healthcare professional.  Sumatriptan is *not* intended for the preventative treatment of migraines or for the treatment of cluster headaches.  While some off-label use exists for cluster headaches, this is not a standard application and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (solution, powder, spray) and the patient's age.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and the medication's package insert.  **Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.**

**Adults (Migraine):**

* **Intranasal Solution (5mg or 20mg per actuation):** The usual starting dose is 20mg in a single nostril.  If needed, a second dose of 20mg may be administered after at least 2 hours, not exceeding 40mg total in 24 hours.
* **Intranasal Powder (11mg per nosepiece):**  The initial dose is 22mg (11mg in each nostril). A second dose of 22mg can be given after at least 2 hours if needed, not exceeding 44mg total in 24 hours.
* **Intranasal Spray (10mg):** The initial dose is 10mg in one nostril. A second dose of 10mg can be administered after at least 1 hour, not exceeding 30mg total in 24 hours.  Note:  Using the spray after another Sumatriptan product (of any form) requires a minimum 1 hour separation; administration after other 5-HT1 agonists is contraindicated.


**Adults (Cluster Headache - Off-Label Use):**

Intranasal Solution (5mg or 20mg per actuation): Initial dose is usually 20mg in the nostril opposite the side of the headache. A second dose of 20mg can be given after at least 2 hours if needed, not exceeding 40mg in 24 hours.

**Children and Adolescents (Migraine):**

Dosage for children and adolescents varies greatly depending on age and weight.  Pediatric dosing should *always* be determined and supervised by a physician. The available intranasal formulations may be used in some children and adolescents, but detailed dosing information is not consistently provided across the different formulation's inserts, and specific weight-based guidelines are needed.  A physician will carefully determine the appropriate dose, type of formulation and the frequency of administration, based on the individual patient's needs.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustments are specifically mentioned in manufacturer labeling for intranasal sumatriptan for mild to moderate impairment. However, due to the lack of first-pass metabolism with intranasal administration, serum concentrations are not expected to be significantly altered.  Intranasal sumatriptan is contraindicated in cases of severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are typically required.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in >10% of patients) may include:

* Unusual taste (dysgeusia)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Nasal discomfort

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) may include:

* Localized numbness
* Nasal cavity pain
* Paresthesia
* Dizziness
* Vertigo
* Localized burning
* Local irritation
* Rhinorrhea (runny nose)
* Sore nose
* Sinus discomfort
* Rhinitis


Serious, but less frequent side effects, reported in post-marketing surveillance, include:

* Hypotension
* Palpitations
* Dystonia
* Tremor

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Sumatriptan works by binding to serotonin (5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>) receptors located on blood vessels in the brain and on trigeminal nerves.  This action leads to vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the brain, reducing the inflammation and pain associated with migraine headaches.  It also inhibits the release of inflammatory neuropeptides, further contributing to pain relief.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or any formulation component.
* Ischemic heart disease or symptoms suggesting it (e.g., angina, myocardial infarction).
* History of cerebrovascular events (strokes, transient ischemic attacks).
* Peripheral vascular disease.
* Uncontrolled hypertension.
* Recent use of ergotamine derivatives or other 5-HT1 agonists (within 24 hours).
* Recent use of MAO inhibitors (within 2 weeks).
* Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or related arrhythmias.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Valvular heart disease.
* Significant underlying cardiovascular disease.
* Ophthalmoplegic migraine.

**Warnings:**

Sumatriptan may increase the risk of:

* Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions.
* Cardiac events (e.g., coronary vasospasm, myocardial infarction).
* Cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage).
* CNS depression.
* Elevated blood pressure.
* Ocular effects (e.g., vision loss).
* Serotonin syndrome.
* Vasospasm-related events.
* Medication overuse headache.
* Chest, throat, neck, or jaw pain/tightness/pressure.

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with a history of seizures or lowered seizure threshold.
* In elderly patients.
* In patients with underlying renal or hepatic impairment.


**Drug Interactions:**  Sumatriptan can interact with several other medications, including certain antidepressants, ergot derivatives, and other migraine medications.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
