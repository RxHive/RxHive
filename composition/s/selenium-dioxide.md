# Selenium Dioxide
### Generic Name
Selenium Dioxide

### Usage

Selenium dioxide is primarily used topically in dermatological applications.  Its main uses are in treating seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor (a fungal skin infection).  While it has other uses in industrial settings as an oxidizing agent and colorant, those applications are not relevant to human medicine.  The topical application targets the skin directly, addressing the symptoms of these specific conditions.


### Dosage

**Seborrheic Dermatitis and Tinea Versicolor:**

* **Topical Application:**  A small amount of selenium dioxide solution (concentration will vary depending on the specific formulation prescribed by a doctor) is applied to the affected areas. The solution should be gently lathered with a small amount of water.  It should be left on the skin for approximately 10 minutes before being thoroughly rinsed. This procedure is typically repeated once daily for seven days.


**Important Note:** The specific concentration and application method should always be prescribed by a healthcare professional.  Do not use any selenium dioxide preparation without a doctor's explicit instructions.  Self-treating can be risky.  Dosage adjustments are not usually made based on age or weight for these topical applications; however, children may require adjustments based on the affected surface area. Always follow your doctor's instructions.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Garlic-like mouth odor, metallic taste.
* **Less Common (but potentially serious):** Hepatic impairment (liver damage), tremors, anorexia (loss of appetite), skin irritation, hair loss, dermatitis, onychodystrophy (nail abnormalities).

**Important:** If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.  The severity of side effects can vary greatly.


### How it Works

The exact mechanism by which selenium dioxide treats seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor isn't fully understood but is believed to be related to its antioxidant properties. Selenium plays a vital role in the body's antioxidant defense system, primarily through its involvement in the enzyme glutathione peroxidase.  This enzyme helps neutralize harmful free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which contribute to inflammation and skin conditions like seborrheic dermatitis.  In the case of tinea versicolor, it's thought to have antifungal properties which help combat the fungal infection.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Selenium dioxide should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to selenium or related compounds.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Selenium dioxide is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the potential risks to a developing fetus are not fully established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be avoided unless specifically deemed necessary and safe by a doctor.
* **Other Medications:** There is limited information available on interactions with other medications.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Individuals with pre-existing liver conditions should use selenium dioxide with extreme caution and under close medical supervision.
