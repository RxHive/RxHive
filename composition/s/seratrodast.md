# Seratrodast
### Generic Name
Seratrodast

### Usage
Seratrodast is primarily used for the prophylactic (preventative) management of mild-to-moderate asthma.  It's a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist, meaning it works by blocking the action of TXA2, a substance that can contribute to airway constriction and inflammation in asthma.  While its main use is asthma prevention, it's crucial to understand that it doesn't treat acute asthma attacks.  For sudden breathing problems, other medications are necessary.

### Dosage

**Adults (Mild-to-moderate asthma prophylaxis):** The usual oral dose is 80 mg once daily. The maximum recommended daily dose is 320 mg.  Elderly patients should typically start with a lower dose of 40 mg daily.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of seratrodast have not been established in children.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Seratrodast can elevate liver enzyme levels, potentially leading to hepatitis.  Therefore, it must be used cautiously in patients with liver problems, requiring regular monitoring of liver function tests (approximately monthly).
* **Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with kidney impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (0.1-5%):**

* Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, LDH)
* Nausea
* Loss of appetite
* Stomach discomfort/abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Dry mouth
* Taste disturbances
* Rash/itching
* Anemia
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Palpitations
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (>0.1%):**

* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)
* Subcutaneous bleeding
* Insomnia
* Tremor
* Numbness

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Seratrodast is a long-acting TXA2 receptor antagonist.  TXA2 is a potent bronchoconstrictor (a substance that narrows the airways) and plays a role in asthma. By blocking TXA2 receptors, seratrodast helps prevent airway hypersensitivity, reducing the likelihood of asthma attacks. It primarily affects airway reactivity rather than directly reducing inflammation. It also helps decrease sputum production and reduces the viscosity (thickness) of airway secretions.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to seratrodast or any of its components.
* Patients with hepatic (liver) failure.
* Acute asthma attacks (seratrodast is for prevention, not acute treatment).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
* Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, requiring close monitoring of liver function.  
* Pregnancy: Use only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  
* Breastfeeding:  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; avoid use during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take seratrodast for an acute asthma attack?**  A: No, seratrodast is for preventing asthma attacks, not treating them. Use a rescue inhaler as prescribed for acute symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store seratrodast?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the packaging. Generally, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.

* **Q: When will I start to feel the effects of seratrodast?** A:  It takes time for seratrodast to build up in your system and have a noticeable effect on asthma symptoms.  You may not experience full benefits for several days or weeks of consistent use.
