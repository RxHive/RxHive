# S-Amlodipine

**Generic Name:** Amlodipine

**Usage:**

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  It helps lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney problems.
* **Chest pain (angina):** It improves blood flow to the heart, reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks.
* **Peripheral artery disease (PAD):** It helps improve blood flow to the legs and feet, relieving symptoms like pain and cramping.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Swelling in ankles and feet (edema)
* Fatigue
* Flushing
* Nausea
* Palpitations


Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing)
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Low blood pressure
* Worsening of heart failure


This is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences may vary.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

Amlodipine belongs to a class of drugs called dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.  It works by relaxing and widening blood vessels. This reduces the resistance to blood flow, leading to lower blood pressure and reduced workload on the heart.  By improving blood flow, it reduces chest pain in angina and improves circulation in PAD.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take amlodipine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are taking.  Some medications can interact with amlodipine.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking amlodipine?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption might be acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects. Consult your doctor.
* **Q: Can I stop taking amlodipine suddenly?** A:  No. Stopping amlodipine abruptly can cause a rebound increase in blood pressure, leading to serious complications.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of taking amlodipine?** A: Long-term use of amlodipine is generally safe and effective for managing hypertension and angina.  However, regular monitoring of blood pressure and potential side effects is necessary.
