# S-Amlodipine
### Generic Name
S-Amlodipine

### Usage
S-Amlodipine is the S-enantiomer of amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker.  It's primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart).  While amlodipine is a racemic mixture (containing both S- and R-enantiomers), S-amlodipine is considered to be the more potent and pharmacologically active isomer.  Therefore, it may offer similar efficacy with potentially reduced side effects compared to the racemic mixture.  Its use is largely focused on cardiovascular conditions where lowering blood pressure and improving blood flow are crucial.  It may also be used off-label in some cases, but this should always be under the direct supervision of a physician.

### Dosage
Dosage of S-amlodipine is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on factors like the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the severity of their condition.  There isn't a widely available formulation of S-amlodipine alone in the same way that racemic amlodipine is, and therefore specific dosage information is currently limited.  Information below relates to the racemic mixture which is used more commonly:

**Oral:**  For adults with hypertension or angina, typical starting dosages of *racemic* amlodipine are usually 5 mg once daily. This may be increased to 10 mg daily, depending on the patient's response and physician's judgment.  Dosage adjustments for children are not standardized and should only be determined by a physician experienced in pediatric cardiology.

**IV:**  Intravenous administration is not a standard route for amlodipine.


**Important Note:** The information provided here concerns *racemic* amlodipine.  S-amlodipine dosage is not yet definitively established and should only be determined by a physician in the context of a clinical trial or research setting.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of *racemic* amlodipine (which may be observed with S-amlodipine to a lesser or greater degree) include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Swelling in the ankles or feet (peripheral edema)
* Flushing
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Palpitations

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Liver damage
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)


**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works
S-amlodipine, like its racemic counterpart, works by blocking the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells.  This leads to relaxation of blood vessels (vasodilation), reducing peripheral vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure.  In the heart, it helps to reduce the workload on the heart and improve blood flow to the heart muscle, relieving angina symptoms. The S-enantiomer is thought to be more selective in its action compared to the racemic mixture.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Amlodipine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to amlodipine or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.
* **Heart Failure:**  Caution is needed in patients with severe heart failure.
* **Liver Disease:**  Amlodipine is primarily metabolized by the liver; therefore, dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with impaired liver function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of amlodipine during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Amlodipine can interact with several other medications, including some commonly used drugs. Consult a physician about potential interactions if taking other medications.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I stop taking S-amlodipine suddenly?**  A: No, you should never stop taking S-amlodipine (or any blood pressure medication) abruptly without consulting your doctor. Sudden cessation can lead to a dangerous rebound effect.
* **Q: How should I store S-amlodipine?** A: Store S-amlodipine (if available) as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Is S-amlodipine safe for everyone?** A:  S-amlodipine, like all medications, carries potential risks.  Its safety and suitability depend on individual health conditions and other factors.  Always consult a healthcare professional before starting any new medication.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for diagnosis, treatment, and management of medical conditions.  The information provided here relates predominantly to racemic amlodipine, as S-amlodipine is not widely available for clinical use outside of research contexts.
