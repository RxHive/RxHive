# Sodium Phosphate P 32
### Generic Name
Sodium Phosphate P 32

### Usage
Sodium Phosphate P 32 is a radioactive pharmaceutical used primarily in the treatment of polycythemia vera (a bone marrow disorder causing an overproduction of red blood cells) and certain types of chronic leukemia (myelocytic and lymphocytic).  It's also employed palliatively in some cases of patients with extensive bone metastases (cancer spread to the bones), offering pain relief and slowing disease progression.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is a form of radiotherapy, targeting rapidly dividing cells.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** The administered dose of Sodium Phosphate P 32 must be precisely measured using a calibrated radioactivity system immediately before administration.  Dosage is highly individualized and determined by the physician based on the patient's specific condition and overall health.

* **Polycythemia Vera:** Intravenous (IV) administration. The dose typically ranges from 1 to 8 millicuries (mCi) or 37 to 296 megabecquerels (MBq), depending on disease stage and patient size.  Subsequent doses are adjusted as needed.

* **Chronic Leukemia (Myelocytic and Lymphocytic):** Intravenous (IV) administration, usually 6 to 15 mCi (222 to 555 MBq) given alongside hormonal treatments.

* **Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of Sodium Phosphate P 32 have not been established in children.

* **Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not currently specify dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are not specifically defined in the available information. However, one notable side effect is episcleritis (inflammation of the white part of the eye).

Serious but less common side effects can include severe damage to the blood-forming cells in bone marrow (hematopoietic effects), primarily due to overdose.   Radiation-related side effects are also possible. Any unusual symptoms or side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Sodium Phosphate P 32 contains radioactive phosphorus-32.  The body absorbs this radioactive phosphorus, and because rapidly dividing cells, such as those found in cancerous tumors and in the bone marrow during polycythemia vera, readily take up phosphorus, the radiation emitted damages their DNA, inhibiting their growth and ultimately leading to cell death.  This targeted approach makes it an effective treatment for these specific conditions.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Sodium Phosphate P 32 should not be used in patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy.  It is also contraindicated in certain situations involving low blood cell counts (leukocytes and platelets) depending on the specific condition being treated (polycythemia vera or leukemia).

* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of serious effects on blood cell production (hematopoietic effects) with overdose.  Radiation exposure is inherent in this treatment, and appropriate precautions must be taken to minimize exposure to both the patient and healthcare personnel.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sodium Phosphate P 32 is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment as the excretion of the drug in breast milk is unknown.

* **General Precautions:**  Intravenous administration is the standard route.  Handle the medication with care, wearing appropriate protective gear (waterproof gloves), and adhering to radiation safety protocols. This drug should only be administered by trained professionals experienced in handling radioactive materials. Visual inspection of the solution for particles or discoloration should be performed prior to administration when feasible.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Sodium Phosphate P 32 stored?**
    * **A:**  Storage requirements for Sodium Phosphate P 32 are specific to radiation safety and will be provided by the supplier. It is crucial to follow those instructions exactly to minimize radiation risk.

* **Q: How long does the treatment last?**
    * **A:**  Treatment duration depends entirely on the patient's response and the specific condition.  This is determined and monitored by the physician.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?**
    * **A:**  This medication is not typically given as a continuous regimen. Missed doses should be addressed immediately with a healthcare provider.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?**
    * **A:**   Concurrent chemotherapy is contraindicated.  Other potential interactions should be discussed with a physician or pharmacist.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Sodium Phosphate P 32?**
    * **A:** Long-term effects vary by individual response. Regular monitoring of blood counts and overall health is essential.  A physician can address specific long-term concerns.
