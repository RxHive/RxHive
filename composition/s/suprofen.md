# Suprofen
### Generic Name
Suprofen

### Usage
Suprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for managing postsurgical pain.  Historically, it was available as an oral medication and a topical ophthalmic solution. However, the oral formulation has been withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about renal toxicity. The topical ophthalmic solution, used to prevent pupil constriction (miosis) during and after eye surgery, has also been discontinued in many regions, including the US.

### Dosage
Dosage information provided here is based on past usage and should not be considered current practice as Suprofen is largely unavailable.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for any medication needs.

* **Postsurgical Pain Management (Intramuscular Injection):**  The typical dose was 200 mg via intramuscular injection.  This is no longer considered a standard treatment option.

* **Ophthalmic Use (Topical Eye Drops - Discontinued):**  The typical regimen involved instilling 2 drops of a 1% solution into the eye three times in the hour before surgery, then twice in the two hours before the procedure.  On the day before surgery, 2 drops every four hours while awake was sometimes recommended.  Again, this formulation is largely unavailable.

* **Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Suprofen in children have not been established.  There is no approved pediatric dosage.

### Side Effects
The following side effects have been reported with Suprofen use:

* **Common:** Local discomfort and irritation (particularly with ophthalmic use), nausea, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain or indigestion, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, and sleepiness.
* **Less Common, but Serious:**  Renal (kidney) dysfunction (new or worsening), high blood pressure, hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells), mild reduction in white blood cells (leukopenia), cardiovascular effects (such as increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and swelling), contact dermatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, blood disorders, liver damage (hepatotoxicity), and vision changes.

Any new or worsening side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Suprofen, like other NSAIDs, works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever.  Suprofen achieves this inhibition by binding to the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which are responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. By blocking these enzymes, Suprofen reduces inflammation and pain.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Suprofen is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Suprofen or similar medications, including aspirin and other NSAIDs.  Those with a history of allergic reactions such as rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages), hives, asthma, or other allergic responses to NSAIDs should avoid this medication.  In the case of the ophthalmic formulation, it was also contraindicated in patients with epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (a type of eye infection).

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using Suprofen may face an increased risk of cardiovascular events (high blood pressure, fast heart rate, edema), gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration, blood disorders, liver damage, kidney damage, and contact dermatitis.

* **Use with Caution:** Suprofen should be used cautiously in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding, or perforation; in patients with liver or kidney impairment; and in patients with existing cardiovascular issues.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Suprofen is a Category C pregnancy drug.  This means that the potential benefits of the drug may not outweigh the risks to the fetus.  Use during pregnancy is generally not recommended.  Suprofen is excreted in breast milk, but is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics, although careful consideration is recommended.

### FAQs
* **Q: Is Suprofen still available?** A:  The oral and ophthalmic formulations of Suprofen are largely unavailable in many parts of the world due to safety concerns and discontinuation by manufacturers.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

* **Q: How should I store Suprofen (if you had it)?** A:  (This section would have included storage instructions if the medication was still commercially available.)  Generally, medication should be stored as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from children.

* **Q: Can I take Suprofen with other medications?** A:  This requires a discussion with a healthcare professional.  Potential interactions with other drugs, particularly other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and certain medications for heart conditions, should be carefully evaluated.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, herbal remedies, and supplements you are taking.
