# Spirapril
### Generic Name
Spirapril

### Usage
Spirapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor primarily used to treat mild to severe hypertension (high blood pressure) and left ventricular dysfunction following a myocardial infarction (heart attack).  Its primary action is to lower blood pressure, reducing the strain on the heart.  While its main use focuses on these two conditions, it may also play a supporting role in managing other cardiovascular issues under a physician's guidance.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For mild to severe hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction, the usual starting dose is 6 mg once daily (OD) orally.  

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Spirapril in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for individuals with significant liver dysfunction.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 30 mL/min, no dosage adjustment is typically necessary. However, if CrCl is less than 30 mL/min, the dose is reduced to 3 mg OD.


The medication is usually administered orally, typically as a tablet.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Cough
* Headache
* Muscle aches (myalgia)
* Increased urination (polyuria)
* Low sodium levels (hyponatremia)
* Sore throat (pharyngitis)
* Sinus infection (sinusitis)
* Skin rash
* Nausea/vomiting
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat – seek immediate medical attention)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
* Chest pain
* Pneumonia (pneumonitis)
* Fainting (syncope)
* Protein in the urine (proteinuria)
* Low white blood cell count (agranulocytosis – especially concerning in individuals with cardiovascular disease and/or renal impairment)
* Liver failure (rare)
* Kidney failure


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Spirapril is an ACE inhibitor.  It works by blocking the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is involved in raising blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. By inhibiting ACE, Spirapril prevents the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing both preload (the volume of blood returning to the heart) and afterload (the resistance the heart must overcome to pump blood).  This, in turn, lowers blood pressure and reduces the workload on the heart.  Additionally, Spirapril promotes sodium and water excretion, further contributing to blood pressure reduction.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Spirapril is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Spirapril or other ACE inhibitors; those with a history of hereditary or idiopathic angioedema, or angioedema associated with previous ACE inhibitor treatment; during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy; and with concomitant use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes mellitus or moderate-to-severe renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²).

**Warnings:** There's an increased risk of angioedema (potentially life-threatening), hypotension (especially in patients with heart failure or volume depletion), dry cough, hematologic effects (low blood cell counts), hyperkalemia, anaphylaxis during lipid apheresis, proteinuria, cholestatic jaundice, and renal function deterioration.


**Interactions:** Spirapril can interact with various medications, including diuretics (leading to excessive blood pressure drops), NSAIDs (reducing Spirapril's effectiveness and potentially harming kidneys), potassium-sparing diuretics (increasing potassium levels), lithium (increasing lithium toxicity), gold (causing nitritoid reactions), anesthetic drugs (enhancing hypotensive effects), narcotic drugs/antipsychotics (increasing postural hypotension), allopurinol, cytostatic/immunosuppressive agents, systemic corticosteroids, procainamide (increasing risk of leukopenia), sodium chloride (attenuating antihypertensive effect), alcohol (enhancing hypotensive effect), and antidiabetics (enhancing blood sugar reduction). Consult your doctor about potential interactions with your other medications.

**Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in patients with aortic stenosis, collagen vascular disease (especially with renal impairment), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, unstented unilateral/bilateral renal artery stenosis, and renal insufficiency.  It is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Breastfeeding mothers should use Spirapril cautiously, as excretion in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Spirapril with other medications?** A:  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Spirapril, as interactions can occur.
* **Q: How should I store Spirapril?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Spirapril suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping Spirapril suddenly can be harmful. You should always consult your doctor before discontinuing the medication.  They will advise on a safe and gradual tapering off schedule.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe swelling?** A: Angioedema is a serious side effect causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and can be life-threatening. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience this.
