# Sparfloxacin
### Generic Name
Sparfloxacin

### Usage
Sparfloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic primarily used to treat community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults.  While not officially labeled for these uses, it's sometimes used off-label for urinary tract infections and skin/subcutaneous tissue infections.  The decision to use sparfloxacin for off-label indications should always be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Community-acquired pneumonia; acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis:** The typical regimen involves a 400 mg loading dose on the first day, followed by 200 mg daily for a total of 10 days.
* **Urinary tract infections (off-label):**  A typical regimen may be 200mg loading dose followed by 100 mg once daily for 7-14 days.
* **Skin and/or subcutaneous tissue infections (off-label):** A common regimen may be 100 mg twice daily.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of sparfloxacin in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment.  Use with caution in patients with liver disease and close monitoring is recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 50 mL/min, the dosage is adjusted to 400 mg on day 1, followed by 200 mg every 48 hours for a total of 9 days.

**Administration:** Sparfloxacin is usually administered orally.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea

* Abdominal pain

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Convulsions
* QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality)
* Liver enzyme elevation

* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Sparfloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By blocking these enzymes, sparfloxacin prevents bacterial growth and ultimately kills the bacteria causing the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sparfloxacin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to sparfloxacin or other fluoroquinolones, those with a history of photosensitivity reactions, those concurrently using class Ia or class III antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs that prolong the QTc interval, and those with known QTc prolongation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Sparfloxacin's absorption can be reduced by antacids and sucralfate.  It's advisable to take sparfloxacin at least two hours before or after these medications.  The absorption may also be reduced by zinc or iron salts; consider taking these medications 4 hours after sparfloxacin. 
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Sparfloxacin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  It is excreted in breast milk and should be used cautiously in breastfeeding women.  A healthcare provider should be consulted before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Exercise caution in patients with known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) disorders.  Patients should be advised to avoid direct sunlight and maintain adequate hydration.

* **Q: Can I take sparfloxacin with food?** A: Sparfloxacin can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store sparfloxacin?** A: Store sparfloxacin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking sparfloxacin?** A: Dizziness is a possible side effect. Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience dizziness.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of sparfloxacin?** A: While generally well-tolerated for short-term use, long-term use of fluoroquinolones, including sparfloxacin, has been associated with some potential risks.  Discuss any concerns about long-term use with your healthcare provider.
