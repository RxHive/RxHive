# Salbutamol + Bromhexine + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Salbutamol + Bromhexine + Ammonium Chloride + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination is typically used to treat symptoms of respiratory tract infections, particularly those causing cough with phlegm (productive cough) and bronchospasm (wheezing).  It's often used for conditions like bronchitis and common colds where these symptoms are present.  The specific roles of each ingredient are:

* **Salbutamol:** A bronchodilator, it relaxes the muscles around the airways, making breathing easier.  It helps relieve wheezing and shortness of breath.
* **Bromhexine:** An expectorant, it thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** Also an expectorant, it helps to liquefy the mucus in the airways.
* **Menthol:** A counterirritant, it creates a cooling sensation in the airways, which can provide temporary relief from cough and congestion.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **Salbutamol related:** Tremors, nervousness, headache, palpitations, increased heart rate.  Rarely, more serious cardiac side effects.
* **Bromhexine related:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea.  Rarely, allergic reactions.
* **Ammonium Chloride related:**  Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset.  Can also cause metabolic acidosis in those with kidney impairment.
* **Menthol related:**  Mouth and throat irritation.


**How it Works:** The combination works synergistically. Salbutamol opens up the airways, allowing for easier breathing. Bromhexine and Ammonium Chloride thin and loosen the mucus, making it easier to expel. Menthol provides a soothing effect by creating a cooling sensation and may help suppress the cough reflex.
