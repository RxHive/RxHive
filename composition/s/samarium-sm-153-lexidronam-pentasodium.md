# Samarium Sm 153 Lexidronam Pentasodium
### Generic Name
Samarium Sm 153 Lexidronam Pentasodium

### Usage
Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium is a radiopharmaceutical used primarily to relieve bone pain in adults with multiple painful osteoblastic skeletal metastases.  These are cancerous bone lesions that show increased uptake of technetium (99mTc)-labeled bisphosphonates on bone scans.  This medication is not indicated for use in children.

### Dosage
The typical adult dosage is 1 mCi/kg (37 MBq/kg) administered intravenously.  This should be given over one minute through a secure in-dwelling catheter, followed immediately by a saline flush.  The medication should not be diluted or mixed with other solutions.  Patients should receive 500 mL of fluids (either intravenously or orally) before receiving the injection.  Dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal impairment, or those with extreme weights, have not been established.  Use caution in these populations, and close monitoring is advised.  Pediatric use is not established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (>10% incidence) include hematologic issues such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and anemia (low red blood cell count).

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

*   Nervous system: Dizziness
*   Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias, hypertension, stroke
*   Dermatologic: Ecchymosis (bruising)
*   Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea
*   Neuromuscular and skeletal: Bone pain, spinal cord compression
*   Renal: Hematuria (blood in urine)
*   Respiratory: Bronchitis, epistaxis (nosebleed)

More serious, though less common, side effects include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hypocalcemia.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium is a chelated complex containing a radioactive isotope of samarium.  It has an affinity for bone tissue and concentrates in areas of high bone turnover associated with osteoblastic metastases.  By selectively targeting these areas, it delivers cytotoxic radiation directly to the cancerous bone lesions, thus reducing pain.

### Precautions
This medication is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP), similar phosphonate compounds, or any component of the formulation.

Use with caution in patients with:

*   Heart failure
*   Risk of hypocalcemia
*   Incontinence (urinary catheterization may be necessary to prevent radioactive contamination)
*   Renal insufficiency


Samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium can increase the risk of bone marrow suppression, transient increases in bone pain, and DIC.  It has a synergistic effect with chemotherapy or external beam radiotherapy in suppressing bone marrow function.  Pregnant women should have a negative pregnancy test before administration, and should be advised to avoid pregnancy shortly after receiving the medication.  Breastfeeding should cease and be replaced with formula feeding.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for the pain relief to begin?** A: The onset of pain relief varies, but some patients experience improvements within days.  The full therapeutic effect may take several weeks.

*   **Q: How long will I be radioactive after receiving the injection?** A: The patient remains radioactive for approximately 12 hours following administration.  Special precautions related to urination and hygiene are necessary during this time.  Always follow your healthcare provider's guidelines for handling and disposal of waste.

*   **Q: What are the long-term effects of this medication?** A: Long-term effects are dependent on many factors, including overall health and response to treatment. Your healthcare provider can offer personalized information on potential long-term effects based on your individual circumstances. Regular monitoring is crucial.

*   **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report all side effects, especially any that are severe or unusual, to your healthcare provider immediately.  

*   **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: Specific storage requirements should be provided by the healthcare professional and the product labeling, usually involving refrigeration until administration.
