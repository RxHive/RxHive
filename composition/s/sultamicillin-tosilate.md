# Sultamicillin tosilate
### Generic Name
Sultamicillin tosilate

### Usage
Sultamicillin tosilate is an antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of bacteria, particularly those affecting the respiratory tract (like bronchitis, pneumonia, and sinusitis),  the urinary tract (like cystitis and pyelonephritis), and skin and soft tissue infections. It's also sometimes used for treating ear infections (otitis media) in children.  It's important to note that sultamicillin is only effective against bacteria; it won't work against viral infections like the common cold or flu.  The specific bacterial targets for sultamicillin are those susceptible to both ampicillin (a penicillin antibiotic) and sulbactam (a beta-lactamase inhibitor).  This combination makes it effective against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant to ampicillin alone.

### Dosage

Dosage of sultamicillin tosilate varies depending on the specific infection being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the illness.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  There is no standardized dosage information widely available for IV administration.  The drug is primarily administered orally.

**Oral Administration (Typical Doses – Always consult a physician for the correct dose):**

* **Adults:** The usual dose is one 375mg to 750mg tablet every 12 hours.
* **Children:** The dosage for children is determined by their weight and the doctor's assessment of their condition. A pediatric dosage form may be available.

**Important Note:**  There's limited readily available information concerning IV administration of sultamicillin tosilate. If an IV formulation is ever prescribed, it must be administered by a healthcare professional in a controlled medical setting, using the dosage and guidance specifically provided by the physician.  

**General Administration Guidelines:** Take the medication with a full glass of water.  It can be taken with or without food, but consistency in timing is advisable.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of sultamicillin tosilate can include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis – seek immediate medical attention if this occurs).
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a potentially serious complication affecting the gut).
* Liver dysfunction
* Seizures (in individuals with pre-existing conditions or those on high doses)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Sultamicillin tosilate is a combination antibiotic composed of ampicillin and sulbactam. Ampicillin works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, which ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.  However, some bacteria produce an enzyme called beta-lactamase that can break down ampicillin, rendering it ineffective. Sulbactam inhibits beta-lactamase, allowing the ampicillin to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant. This dual action ensures broader effectiveness against a wider range of bacterial species.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not take sultamicillin if you are allergic to penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics (like cephalosporins).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision.  The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.
* **Kidney Problems:**  Individuals with kidney impairment require dosage adjustment.  The doctor will determine the appropriate dose.
* **Interactions:** Sultamicillin can interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners) and some diuretics. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Inflammatory Bowel Disease:** Exercise caution if you have a history of inflammatory bowel disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take sultamicillin with other medications?**  A: Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store sultamicillin?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking sultamicillin if I feel better?** A: No. Complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better before finishing the medication. This helps prevent recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.
* **Q: Is sultamicillin safe for children?** A:  Sultamicillin can be used in children, but the dosage and suitability must be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's weight and specific condition.
