# Sarecycline
### Generic Name
Sarecycline

### Usage
Sarecycline is a narrow-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic primarily used to treat inflammatory lesions of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris (acne) in individuals aged 9 years and older.  It's specifically indicated for non-nodular acne, meaning acne without large, solid bumps.  It's important to note that Sarecycline is not used to treat infections.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The oral dosage for adults with non-nodular moderate-to-severe acne varies based on weight:

*   **33-54 kg:** 60 mg once daily
*   **55-84 kg:** 100 mg once daily
*   **85-136 kg:** 150 mg once daily

Treatment should be reassessed if there's no improvement after 12 weeks.  Long-term efficacy (beyond 12 weeks) and safety (beyond 12 months) haven't been established.


**Children (9 years and older):**  The dosage for children aged 9 years and older is the same as for adults, based on their weight.  However, the safety and effectiveness of Sarecycline in children younger than 9 years have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, as no significant differences in how the body processes Sarecycline have been observed in these populations.

### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

*   Nausea (Gastrointestinal)

**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

*   Vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection)
*   Vulvovaginal mycotic infection


If you experience any adverse effects, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Sarecycline is an oral antibiotic derived from tetracyclines, possessing anti-inflammatory properties.  Tetracyclines, in general, work by binding to bacterial ribosomes (the protein-making machinery within bacteria), inhibiting protein synthesis and thus preventing bacterial growth. However, the precise mechanism by which Sarecycline treats acne is still not completely understood.  Its effectiveness in acne likely involves both its antibacterial action and its anti-inflammatory effects.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Sarecycline is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Sarecycline, other tetracyclines, or any components of the medication.

**Warnings and Increased Risk:**

*   **Pregnancy:** Tetracyclines can cause fetal harm.  Sarecycline should be stopped immediately if pregnancy occurs during treatment. It can cause permanent tooth discoloration and inhibit bone growth if used during tooth and bone development.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding is not recommended during Sarecycline use.
*   **Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects:** Lightheadedness, dizziness, and vertigo are possible.
*   **Intracranial Hypertension:** Increased risk of intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull), particularly when used with oral retinoids.
*   **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight.
*   **Drug-Resistant Bacteria:**  Prolonged or repeated use can contribute to the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
*   **Superinfection:**  There's a risk of fungal or bacterial superinfection (overgrowth of other microorganisms), including *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis.
*   **Interactions:** Sarecycline may interact with oral retinoids, antacids (containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium), bismuth subsalicylate, iron preparations, penicillin, anticoagulants, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates.  Consult your healthcare provider about potential drug interactions.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Sarecycline with food?** A: Sarecycline can be taken with or without food.
*   **Q: How should I store Sarecycline?** A: Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
*   **Q: Is Sarecycline safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term safety beyond 12 months has not been established.
*   **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Sarecycline?** A: It's advisable to avoid tasks requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, due to the potential for CNS side effects.
