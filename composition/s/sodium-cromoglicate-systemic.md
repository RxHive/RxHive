# Sodium Cromoglicate (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Sodium Cromoglicate (Systemic)

### Usage
Sodium Cromoglicate is primarily used to prevent asthma attacks.  It's a mast cell stabilizer, meaning it works by preventing the release of substances from mast cells that trigger allergic reactions and inflammation in the airways. This makes it particularly useful for preventing asthma symptoms triggered by allergens or irritants.  While its primary use is in asthma prophylaxis, it also sees off-label use in managing conditions such as mastocytosis (a disorder involving excessive mast cell growth), food allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease.  It's important to note that the effectiveness and safety of sodium cromoglicate for these off-label uses may not be as well-established as its use in asthma prevention.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Management of Bronchial Asthma:** 20 mg via nebulization four times daily (qid) at regular intervals.
* **Mastocytosis:** 200 mg orally qid. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg/kg.
* **Prevention of Acute Bronchospasm:** 20 mg qid via nebulization at regular intervals, or no more than one hour before exposure to a triggering event.
* **Food Allergy & Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Off-label):** 200 mg orally qid. The maximum daily dose is 400 mg qid.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage adjustments are crucial for children, and the safety and efficacy of sodium cromoglicate for some conditions haven't been established in very young children.  Always follow the guidance of a physician for pediatric use.

* **Prophylaxis of Acute Bronchospasm (ages 2 and older):** 20 mg qid via nebulization at regular intervals or no more than one hour before exposure to a triggering event.
* **Management of Bronchial Asthma (ages 2 and older):** 20 mg via nebulization qid at regular intervals.
* **Systemic Mastocytosis:**
    *  <2 years: Safety and efficacy are not established.
    * 2-12 years: 100 mg qid daily; not to exceed 40 mg/kg/day. Administer 30 minutes before meals and bedtime.
    * >12 years: Same as adult dosage.
* **Food Allergy & Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Off-label):**
    * <2 years: Not recommended.
    * 2-12 years: 100 mg qid initially. The dose may be doubled if the effect is not satisfactory within 2-3 weeks, but should not exceed 40 mg/kg/day.
    * â‰¥12 years: 200 mg qid initially. The dose may be doubled if the effect is not satisfactory within 2-3 weeks, but should not exceed 400 mg qid.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment.  A doctor should carefully adjust the dosage based on individual needs and health status.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include: abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and a slightly unpleasant taste.

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, include: angioedema, behavior changes, erythema, esophagospasm, flushing, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, neutropenia, palpitation, pancytopenia, photosensitivity, polycythemia, premature ventricular contractions, pruritus, psychosis, and stomatitis.

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Sodium cromoglicate works by stabilizing mast cells.  Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other inflammatory substances when triggered by allergens or irritants. By stabilizing these mast cells, sodium cromoglicate prevents the release of these inflammatory mediators, thus reducing inflammation in the airways and preventing allergic reactions that can lead to asthma attacks. It may also reduce the release of inflammatory leukotrienes and potentially inhibit calcium influx into cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sodium cromoglicate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug and during an acute asthma attack.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Sodium cromoglicate is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning that studies in animals have not shown a risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The excretion of this drug into breast milk is unknown; therefore, it should be used with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:** Interactions with other medications are rare but should be discussed with a doctor.
* **Children and Older Adults:** Pediatric dosage adjustments are critical, and caution should be exercised in older adults due to potential increased sensitivity to side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Sodium Cromoglicate?**  A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take Sodium Cromoglicate with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The full preventative effect may not be seen immediately.  It often takes regular use for several days or weeks to achieve optimal benefit.

* **Q: Is Sodium Cromoglicate addictive?** A: No, Sodium Cromoglicate is not addictive.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Sodium Cromoglicate suddenly?** A:  Generally, it's advisable to consult your doctor before stopping treatment, as sudden cessation might lead to a worsening of symptoms.
