# Scopolamine
### Generic Name
Scopolamine

### Usage

Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, is primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting.  Its key applications include:

* **Motion sickness:** Scopolamine effectively reduces the symptoms of nausea and vomiting associated with travel by car, boat, plane, or other modes of transportation.
* **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV):**  It's often administered before or after surgery to prevent or lessen the unpleasant side effects of anesthesia.
* **Treatment of smooth muscle spasms:** In certain cases, scopolamine can help relax spasms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or genitourinary tract.  This may be used as part of treatment for conditions causing such spasms or in preparation for diagnostic procedures.
* **Sedation and amnesia (as an adjunct to anesthesia):** Scopolamine can be used with other anesthetics to enhance sedation and produce amnesia during surgical procedures.


### Dosage

Scopolamine is available in several forms, and dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the patient's age and weight.  **It is crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions exactly.**  The information below is for general knowledge and should not be used in place of a doctor's guidance.

**Adults:**

* **Transdermal patch (motion sickness, PONV):**  One patch is applied to a hairless area behind the ear. For motion sickness, this is usually applied at least 4 hours before anticipated exposure and changed every 3 days as needed. For PONV, it's typically applied the night before surgery and removed 24 hours post-surgery.
* **Intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection (sedation, amnesia, spasm treatment):**  Dosage ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 mg, repeated 3-4 times daily for sedation and amnesia.  For spasm treatment,  the dosage and frequency will vary depending on the specific condition and severity.
* **Oral (spasm treatment):**  Dosage typically ranges from 10-20 mg per day for acute therapy and 10 mg three to five times daily for prolonged therapy.  Maximum daily doses vary and should be determined by the physician.


**Children:**

Pediatric dosing of scopolamine is much more complex and highly dependent on the child's age and weight.  It should only be administered under the strict supervision and guidance of a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare professional.  Intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous injections are typically given at a dose of 6 mcg/kg per dose (maximum dose 0.3 mg per dose), potentially repeated every 6-8 hours. Transdermal patches may be used in adolescents for motion sickness, following the same guidelines as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling may not always provide specific dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment. However, caution is generally advised in patients with these conditions due to the increased risk of adverse effects. A healthcare professional must carefully assess the individual patient's needs.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

**Less common, but potentially serious side effects:**

* Agitation
* Confusion
* Blurred vision
* Visual impairment
* Mydriasis (dilated pupils)
* Urinary retention
* Decreased gastrointestinal motility
* Difficulty urinating (dysuria)
* Hallucinations
* Seizures


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Scopolamine is an anticholinergic drug, meaning it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in numerous bodily functions, including muscle contractions and glandular secretions. By blocking acetylcholine at specific receptors (muscarinic receptors), scopolamine reduces smooth muscle activity, resulting in the relaxation of spasms in the GI and genitourinary tracts. It also affects the central nervous system, contributing to its antiemetic and sedative effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Scopolamine is contraindicated in individuals with certain conditions, including glaucoma (especially narrow-angle glaucoma), myasthenia gravis, paralytic ileus, and hypersensitivity to scopolamine or related medications.  Specific contraindications vary slightly depending on the form of scopolamine used (oral, injection, transdermal).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Scopolamine can interact with numerous other medications.  It's vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting scopolamine.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Scopolamine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully established.  It's also excreted in breast milk, and the decision to use it during breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.
* **Elderly and Children:**  Elderly patients and children are more sensitive to the effects of scopolamine and require careful monitoring for adverse reactions.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Scopolamine can cause drowsiness and blurred vision, so it's important to avoid driving or operating machinery until these side effects have subsided.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for scopolamine to work?**  A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration.  Transdermal patches take several hours to reach full effect, while injections work more rapidly.
* **Q: How should I store scopolamine?** A:  Store scopolamine as directed on the product label. Generally, it should be kept at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking scopolamine?** A:  Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of scopolamine and increase the risk of adverse reactions. It is best to avoid alcohol while using this medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not try to "catch up" by taking a double dose. If you miss a dose of oral or injected scopolamine, contact your physician to determine the best course of action.  If you miss a dose of the transdermal patch, apply a new one as soon as you remember.
