# Saccharomyces Boulardii
### Generic Name
Saccharomyces Boulardii

### Usage
Saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast, classified as a probiotic.  Its primary use is in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea.  This includes diarrhea caused by various bacterial and viral infections.  It may also be helpful in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a common side effect of antibiotic treatment. While research is ongoing, some studies suggest potential benefits in treating other gastrointestinal conditions, such as Clostridium difficile infection (C. difficile), but more research is needed to confirm these secondary uses.

### Dosage
Dosage information provided here is for general knowledge and should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional. Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Adults:** The typical dose for acute infectious diarrhea is 250 mg twice daily (BID).

**Children:**  The dosage for children is generally the same as for adults; however, a healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage based on the child's age, weight, and specific condition.  Never administer medication to a child without consulting a doctor or pharmacist.

**Forms:** Saccharomyces boulardii is available in capsule and powder forms. The powder can be mixed with food or drinks, as per package instructions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent.  They may include:

* Gastrointestinal disturbances (such as mild bloating or gas)


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, especially in immunocompromised individuals, may include:

* Fungemia (presence of yeast in the bloodstream) - this is rare but potentially serious and requires immediate medical attention.


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are concerning or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Saccharomyces boulardii works by several mechanisms. It doesn't directly kill harmful bacteria, but rather helps restore the balance of the gut flora. It achieves this by:

* **Competing with harmful bacteria:** It competes with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients and attachment sites in the gut, limiting their growth and spread.
* **Boosting the immune system:** It stimulates the production of certain immune factors, which help protect the gut lining and fight off infections.
* **Producing substances that inhibit harmful bacteria:** It produces substances, such as organic acids, which have a hostile environment for some pathogenic bacteria.
* **Reducing inflammation:** It contributes to a reduction in inflammation of the intestinal lining.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Saccharomyces boulardii is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity or allergy to yeast or any component of the formulation. It's also contraindicated in patients with central venous catheters and those with immunocompromised states that increase risk of systemic fungal infection (such as fungemia).
* **Interactions:** Systemic or oral antifungal medications may interfere with the effectiveness of Saccharomyces boulardii.  Avoid combining these medications without consulting your physician.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using Saccharomyces boulardii.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:** Individuals with weakened immune systems should exercise extreme caution and consult their doctor before using this probiotic.  There's a higher risk of systemic infection in these groups.
* **Central Venous Catheters:** Avoid using this probiotic if you have a central venous catheter due to increased risk of bloodstream infections.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Saccharomyces boulardii with antibiotics?** A:  While it's often used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea, always consult your physician before combining them.  Your doctor can assess if it's appropriate in your situation.

* **Q: How should I store Saccharomyces boulardii?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.  Relief from diarrhea is often observed within a few days, but itâ€™s essential to complete the prescribed course.

* **Q: Is Saccharomyces boulardii safe for long-term use?** A:  Generally, short-term use is recommended for acute conditions. Long-term use should be discussed with your doctor to assess the risks and benefits.  Consult your doctor before starting any long-term probiotic regimen.
