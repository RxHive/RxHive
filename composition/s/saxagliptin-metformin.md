# Saxagliptin + Metformin
### Generic Name
Saxagliptin + Metformin

### Usage

Saxagliptin and metformin combination therapy is primarily used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  This combination is particularly helpful for individuals whose blood sugar levels are not adequately managed with metformin alone.  Metformin works by decreasing the amount of glucose your liver produces and improving your body's sensitivity to insulin. Saxagliptin works by increasing the body's production of incretin hormones, which help to stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar).  Together, they offer a more comprehensive approach to managing type 2 diabetes than either drug in isolation.  While not a primary indication, this combination may sometimes be considered in situations where single-agent therapy hasn't been successful.

### Dosage

Dosage for Saxagliptin + Metformin varies greatly depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage based on factors such as your current blood sugar levels, kidney function, and overall health.  It is crucial to follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  There isn't a universally applicable dosage chart for all patients, and the combination's specific strengths (e.g., 2.5mg/500mg, 2.5mg/1000mg, 5mg/500mg, 5mg/1000mg) will be prescribed individually.  

* **Oral Administration:**  This combination is typically administered orally, once daily, with or without food. However, this needs to be confirmed by the prescribing healthcare professional for any individual case.

* **Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on your response to the medication and kidney function.  Renal impairment significantly affects the elimination of both saxagliptin and metformin, requiring careful monitoring and potential dose reductions.  The prescribing healthcare professional will assess this aspect rigorously.

* **Children:** This combination is not approved for use in children.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of Saxagliptin + Metformin can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Stomach pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Upper respiratory infection
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), particularly if combined with other diabetes medications or if not eating regularly
* Joint pain
* Back pain
* Fatigue

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Lactic acidosis (a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in the blood, more common with metformin, especially in individuals with kidney problems)
* Liver problems

If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Saxagliptin and Metformin work synergistically to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.  Saxagliptin enhances incretin activity. Incretins are hormones released in the gut after eating, stimulating insulin release from the pancreas and suppressing glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar).  By inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, saxagliptin prolongs the activity of incretins, leading to better glucose regulation. The combination of these two mechanisms helps to lower blood sugar levels more effectively than either drug alone.

### Precautions

* **Kidney Disease:**  Both saxagliptin and metformin are excreted by the kidneys.  Individuals with kidney disease may require dose adjustments or may not be suitable candidates for this combination therapy. Close monitoring of kidney function is necessary.

* **Liver Disease:** Individuals with severe liver disease should not use this medication.

* **Heart Failure:** Metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe heart failure. Use caution with moderate heart failure.

* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption may increase the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin.

* **Surgery:**  Metformin should usually be stopped before and after major surgery or procedures involving contrast dye.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a physician;  metformin is generally preferred over saxagliptin.

* **Drug Interactions:** Saxagliptin and metformin can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Avoid use if you have a known allergy to saxagliptin or metformin.
