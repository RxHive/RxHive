# Saxagliptin + Metformin

**Generic Name:** Saxagliptin/Metformin

**Usage:**

Saxagliptin/Metformin is a combination oral medication used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It's typically prescribed when metformin alone is not enough to manage blood sugar levels effectively.  The combination is often used as a second-line treatment after metformin monotherapy has been tried.  It's used to lower blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain. These are more likely with metformin.
* **Upper respiratory tract infections:** Cough, sore throat, runny nose.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** Especially if the dosage isn't properly managed or if the patient is also taking other diabetes medications or skipping meals. Symptoms can include dizziness, sweating, shakiness, confusion.
* **Joint pain:**  Reported by some users.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling.  Rare but serious allergic reactions can occur.
* **Lactic acidosis (rare but serious):** A buildup of lactic acid in the blood, primarily associated with metformin.  Risk factors include kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, and excessive alcohol consumption.  This is a medical emergency.


**How it Works:**

This combination medication works through two different mechanisms:

* **Saxagliptin:** This is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  It works by increasing the levels of incretins, hormones that stimulate insulin release from the pancreas after a meal and reduce glucagon secretion (glucagon raises blood sugar). This leads to improved glucose control.

* **Metformin:** This is a biguanide. It works by decreasing the amount of glucose produced by the liver, increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin, and improving glucose uptake by cells.  It also has some effects on improving lipid profiles.

By combining these two mechanisms, Saxagliptin/Metformin provides a more comprehensive approach to blood sugar management than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Who shouldn't take Saxagliptin/Metformin?**  People with severe kidney disease, severe liver disease, heart failure, a history of lactic acidosis, or those allergic to either saxagliptin or metformin should not take this medication.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also generally avoid it.

* **How is Saxagliptin/Metformin dosed?**  Dosage is determined by a doctor and depends on individual factors such as kidney function and overall health. It's usually started at a lower dose and gradually increased as needed.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **What are the long-term effects?** Long-term use can lead to some of the side effects mentioned above, particularly gastrointestinal problems.  Regular monitoring of kidney function and blood sugar levels is important.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Saxagliptin/Metformin?**  Alcohol consumption should be limited, particularly with metformin, as it increases the risk of lactic acidosis.

* **Does Saxagliptin/Metformin cause weight gain?**  Metformin typically does not cause weight gain, and saxagliptin may even have a slightly weight-neutral or even slightly weight-reducing effect; however, individual responses vary.
