# Sevoflurane
### Generic Name
Sevoflurane

### Usage
Sevoflurane is a widely used general anesthetic, primarily employed for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia during surgical procedures, both in inpatient and outpatient settings.  It's particularly valued for its rapid onset and offset of action, making it suitable for various surgical specialties and patient populations. While its primary use is as a general anesthetic, it's not typically used for any notable secondary purposes outside of this core function.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Anesthesia):** Surgical levels of anesthesia are usually achieved with Sevoflurane concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 3%, sometimes in combination with nitrous oxide.  The specific concentration will depend greatly on individual patient factors and response.  The Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) values, which indicate the concentration needed to prevent movement in response to surgical incision in 50% of patients, vary with age.  For example, MAC values for Sevoflurane in oxygen are roughly 2.6% in 25-year-olds, decreasing to 1.4% if nitrous oxide is also used.  These values decrease with increasing age.  Precise dosing should be determined and managed by an anesthesiologist.

**Pediatric Dosage (Anesthesia):**  Similar to adults, surgical anesthesia is generally achieved with Sevoflurane concentrations of 0.5% to 3%, sometimes with nitrous oxide.  However, the MAC values are higher in children and infants, reflecting their higher metabolic rate and sensitivity. For instance,  full-term neonates (0-1 month) may require 3.3% Sevoflurane in oxygen, while the concentration gradually decreases as the child ages.  Precise dosing in pediatric patients requires careful consideration of age and weight, and must be determined and managed by a pediatric anesthesiologist.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with creatinine levels above 1.5 mg/dL (renal impairment).  Always consult a physician for appropriate dosage adjustment in such cases.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Agitation
* Hypotension
* Nausea and vomiting
* Cough
* Drowsiness
* Shivering
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Hypothermia
* Myoclonus
* Delirium (emergence)
* Tachycardia
* Bradycardia

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Atrial arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, anaphylactoid reaction, acidosis, albuminuria, bronchospasm, chest discomfort, complete AV block, hepatic failure, hypersensitivity, hyper-/hypoventilation, insomnia, inverted T wave, abnormal liver function tests, oliguria, pruritus, rash, second-degree AV block, seizure, ST depression, syncope, wheezing, increased white blood cell count, and xerostomia.  

**Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Sevoflurane's mechanism of action involves altering the activity of neuronal ion channels.  Specifically, it affects fast-synaptic neurotransmitter receptors, including nicotinic acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate receptors, leading to depression of the central nervous system.  It can also decrease myocardial contractility, lower blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance, and suppress sympathetic nervous activity.  These effects ultimately result in the loss of consciousness and muscle relaxation needed for surgery.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Sevoflurane is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to sevoflurane, other halogenated anesthetics, or any formulation component. It's also contraindicated in patients with known or suspected malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, or those with a history of liver dysfunction, jaundice, unexplained fever, leukocytosis, or eosinophilia following prior halogenated anesthetic administration.  General anesthesia itself is also a contraindication.


**Interactions:**  Sevoflurane's metabolism can be affected by drugs that induce the CYP2E1 isoenzyme (e.g., isoniazid).  Concurrent use with benzodiazepines or opioids may reduce the minimum alveolar concentration needed for surgical anesthesia.  It may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias when combined with sympathomimetic agents or calcium antagonists.  Use with nonselective MAOIs carries a risk of serious interactions. The combination with succinylcholine may rarely raise serum potassium levels, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias.


**Warnings:**  Increased risks include agitation/delirium, postoperative hepatitis or hepatic dysfunction, hypotension, increased intracranial pressure, malignant hyperthermia, QT prolongation, perioperative hyperkalemia, respiratory depression, and pediatric neurotoxicity.  Exercise caution when administering Sevoflurane to patients with hepatic or renal impairment, those at risk for seizures, or those with a risk of QT prolongation.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sevoflurane is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  While medically necessary surgery shouldn't be denied to pregnant women regardless of the trimester, elective procedures are ideally delayed until after delivery.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown but due to rapid elimination, levels are unlikely to be clinically significant 24 hours post-anesthesia.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Sevoflurane administered?**
A: Sevoflurane is administered via inhalation using specifically calibrated vaporizers.

**Q: How long does it take for Sevoflurane to take effect?**
A: The onset of action is relatively rapid.

**Q: How is Sevoflurane stored?**
A:  Store as directed by the manufacturer's labeling.  The specific storage requirements will vary depending on the formulation.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with Sevoflurane?**
A:  Long-term effects are generally uncommon. However, like all anesthetics, the potential for rare, long-term effects exists.

**Q: Can I drive after receiving Sevoflurane anesthesia?**
A: No. You should not drive or operate machinery until fully recovered and cleared by your healthcare provider.  The recovery time will vary depending on the duration and intensity of the anesthesia.

**Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: If you experience any side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.
