# Strontium Ranelate

**Generic Name:** Strontium Ranelate

**Usage:**  Strontium ranelate is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk of fracture.  It's specifically indicated to reduce the risk of vertebral (spine) and non-vertebral fractures.  It is *not* a first-line treatment and is typically considered after other osteoporosis medications have been tried or are unsuitable.

**Side Effects:**  Strontium ranelate can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, headache, dizziness, leg cramps, pain in the limbs.
* **Serious (requiring immediate medical attention):**  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), and increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).  It also carries a slightly increased risk of serious lower limb pain (such as calf pain).


**How it Works:** Strontium ranelate works by affecting bone remodeling â€“ the process of bone breakdown and formation.  It inhibits bone resorption (breakdown) and stimulates bone formation, leading to an overall increase in bone mineral density (BMD).  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it involves interacting with bone cells (osteoclasts and osteoblasts) and influencing their activity.

**FAQs:**

* **Is strontium ranelate safe for everyone?** No.  It's not suitable for everyone with osteoporosis.  It should be avoided in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary embolism (PE), or those with severe kidney problems.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding are also contraindications.  Your doctor will assess your suitability for this medication.

* **How long do I need to take strontium ranelate?**  The duration of treatment depends on individual needs and response, and is determined by your doctor. It's typically a long-term treatment.

* **What are the potential drug interactions?**  Strontium ranelate can interact with other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) you are taking.

* **What are the symptoms of an allergic reaction?**  Symptoms can range from mild (rash, itching) to severe (swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any allergic reaction.

* **Is strontium ranelate available everywhere?**  Availability can vary by country.  In some regions, it may no longer be available due to safety concerns, including the increased risk of cardiovascular events.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Generally, don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
