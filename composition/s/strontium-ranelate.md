# Strontium Ranelate
### Generic Name
Strontium Ranelate

### Usage
Strontium ranelate is primarily used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis, significantly reducing the risk of vertebral fractures.  It's also indicated for treating severe osteoporosis in men who have a heightened risk of fractures due to age or low bone mineral density (BMD).  The drug's effectiveness lies in its ability to improve bone strength and reduce the likelihood of fractures.


### Dosage
**Adults (Osteoporosis):** The standard oral dose is 2 grams daily, dissolved in water and taken before bedtime, preferably at least two hours after eating.  Adequate supplemental calcium and vitamin D are crucial if dietary intake is insufficient.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of strontium ranelate in children under 18 years old haven't been established, and it's therefore not recommended for this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. However, in cases of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), strontium ranelate is not recommended.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, amnesia, paresthesia.
*   Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema.
*   Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia.
*   Other:  Eczema, hypercholesterolemia.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, Post-marketing and/or Case Reports):**

*   Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism.
*   Severe Skin Reactions: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), DRESS syndrome.
*   Other:  Bone marrow failure, increased liver enzymes,  seizures, alopecia.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, immediately consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works
Strontium ranelate works by influencing bone remodeling, the continuous process of bone breakdown and rebuilding. It simultaneously increases bone formation (by stimulating osteoblasts, the bone-building cells) and reduces bone resorption (by inhibiting osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells). This dual action results in a net increase in bone mass and improved bone strength, thus lowering fracture risk.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Strontium ranelate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, a history of venous thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism),  history or current ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease,  uncontrolled hypertension, or those undergoing temporary or permanent immobilization.

**Interactions:**  Food, milk products, and calcium-containing medications significantly reduce strontium ranelate absorption (by 60-70%). Therefore, maintain at least a two-hour gap between strontium ranelate and these substances.  Concurrent use with oral tetracyclines or quinolone antibiotics is not recommended due to potential absorption interference.  Antacids should ideally be taken at least two hours after strontium ranelate.

**Warnings:** Use caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking), those at risk for venous thromboembolism, or those with chronic renal impairment.  Itâ€™s not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take strontium ranelate with calcium supplements?** A:  It's best to avoid taking them together. Separate the intake by at least two hours to maximize strontium ranelate absorption.

*   **Q: How should I store strontium ranelate?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results from strontium ranelate?** A: The time to see noticeable effects varies, but improvements in bone density are usually observed over several months of consistent treatment.

*   **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose to compensate for a missed one.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking strontium ranelate suddenly?** A: No, it is crucial to follow your doctor's instructions regarding the duration of treatment and tapering off the medication.  Stopping suddenly may have negative consequences.  Always consult your physician before making any changes to your medication regimen.
