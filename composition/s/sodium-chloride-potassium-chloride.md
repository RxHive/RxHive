# Sodium Chloride + Potassium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Sodium Chloride + Potassium Chloride (often listed individually on labels)

**Usage:**  This combination is used to replenish electrolytes sodium and potassium in the body.  The specific use depends on the formulation (e.g., intravenous solution, oral powder, tablets). Common uses include:

* **Treatment of electrolyte imbalances:** This occurs in situations like severe dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating (especially excessive), certain medical conditions affecting kidney function, and after major surgery or trauma.
* **Maintenance of electrolyte balance:**  Used in patients who are unable to consume sufficient electrolytes through diet alone, such as those receiving intravenous fluids or those with certain medical conditions.
* **Intravenous fluids:** Often a component of intravenous (IV) fluid solutions to deliver fluids and electrolytes simultaneously.


**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally mild and depend on the dosage and route of administration (oral vs. intravenous).  They can include:

* **Oral administration:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset.
* **Intravenous administration:**  More serious side effects are possible, especially with rapid administration or in individuals with underlying kidney or heart conditions.  These can include:
    * Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
    * High potassium levels (hyperkalemia) â€“ potentially life-threatening
    * High sodium levels (hypernatremia)
    * Swelling (edema)
    * Pain or inflammation at the IV site (phlebitis)


**How it Works:**

* **Sodium Chloride (NaCl):** Provides sodium ions, which are crucial for maintaining fluid balance, nerve and muscle function, and blood pressure.
* **Potassium Chloride (KCl):** Provides potassium ions, essential for muscle contractions, nerve impulses, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.

The combination of sodium and potassium in this product helps to restore and maintain the proper balance of these crucial electrolytes in the body's fluids.  This balance is vital for numerous bodily functions.
