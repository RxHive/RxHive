# Sodium Valproate + Valproic Acid
### Generic Name
Sodium Valproate + Valproic Acid

**Note:**  Sodium valproate and valproic acid are essentially the same medication; sodium valproate is simply a sodium salt form of valproic acid.  They are often used interchangeably and have the same effects. This information covers both forms.

### Usage

Sodium valproate/valproic acid is primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder.  

* **Epilepsy:** It's highly effective in controlling various seizure types, including absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and generalized seizures. It's often used as a first-line treatment for certain types of epilepsy, particularly in children and adolescents.

* **Bipolar Disorder:**  This medication helps stabilize mood swings associated with bipolar disorder, reducing the frequency and severity of manic and depressive episodes.

* **Migraine Prevention:**  In some cases, it might be prescribed to help prevent migraine headaches, although this is less common than its use in epilepsy and bipolar disorder.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the individual, their condition, age, and response to treatment.  **It's crucial to follow the prescription instructions from your doctor precisely.**  There is no single "correct" dosage; it's highly individualized.

* **Oral (Tablets, Capsules, Syrup):**  Dosage starts low and is gradually increased until seizures are controlled or mood is stabilized.  The starting dose for adults and adolescents is typically around 250 mg twice daily, and it can be increased by 250-500 mg every few days, under close medical supervision, to a maximum daily dose of 2500 mg (although higher doses may sometimes be considered for specific conditions). Pediatric dosages vary greatly based on weight and age, determined by a physician. Syrup formulations are often used for children.

* **Intravenous (IV):** IV administration is typically used in emergencies or when oral medication is not possible. The dose and frequency are determined by a physician based on the patient's specific needs and response.  IV administration is usually only administered in a hospital or clinical setting.

**Important Note:** Blood levels of valproate need to be monitored regularly, particularly when starting treatment or adjusting the dosage, to ensure the medication is in the therapeutic range.

### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Tremor
* Weight gain
* Dizziness
* Sleepiness (somnolence)
* Fatigue

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) â€“ especially important to monitor in children
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior

**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

The exact mechanism of action isn't completely understood, but valproic acid is believed to work by:

* **Increasing levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA):** GABA is a neurotransmitter in the brain that inhibits nerve impulses, reducing neuronal excitability and potentially preventing seizures. Valproate enhances GABA's effects.

* **Affecting other neurotransmitters:**  It may also interact with other neurotransmitters in the brain, contributing to its mood-stabilizing effects in bipolar disorder.


### Precautions

* **Liver function tests:**  Liver function should be monitored regularly, particularly during the initial phase of treatment, especially in children.
* **Pregnancy:**  Valproate carries a significant risk of birth defects.  It should only be used during pregnancy in exceptional circumstances and under close medical supervision.
* **Interactions with other drugs:**  Valproate can interact with several other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, herbal supplements, and over-the-counter drugs you are taking.
* **Elderly patients:**  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Alcohol:**  Alcohol should be avoided while taking valproate.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking valproate suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking valproate abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to serious consequences, including seizures.  Dosage reduction should be done gradually and under medical supervision.

* **Q: How should I store valproate?** A: Store valproate at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Is valproate addictive?** A: Valproate is not considered an addictive substance in the same way as opioids or other drugs of abuse. However, physical dependence can occur, meaning that the body can adjust to its presence, and stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
