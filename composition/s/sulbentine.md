# Sulbentine
### Generic Name
Sulbentine (Dibenzthione)

### Usage
Sulbentine, a topical azole antifungal, was primarily used to treat fungal nail infections (onychomycosis).  It's important to note that Sulbentine is no longer commercially available and has been replaced by other, more commonly used antifungal agents for dermatomycoses.  This information is provided for historical context and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for its use.  If you have a fungal nail infection, consult a healthcare professional for current treatment options.

### Dosage
Because Sulbentine is no longer available, specific dosage information is unavailable.  Past prescribing information would have varied based on the formulation (e.g., cream, solution) and the severity and extent of the infection.  Any information found on older prescribing materials should not be used to self-treat.

### Side Effects
Since Sulbentine is discontinued, comprehensive data on side effects is limited to older publications. However, potential side effects that might have been reported include:

* Local irritation at the application site (redness, itching, burning)
* Skin dryness
* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling)


It's crucial to remember that this is not an exhaustive list.  If you experienced any adverse effects from using Sulbentine in the past, consult a doctor.

### How it Works
Sulbentine, like other azole antifungals, inhibits the fungal enzyme 14Î±-demethylase. This enzyme is crucial for the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting this enzyme, Sulbentine disrupts ergosterol production, leading to an accumulation of abnormal sterols within the fungal cell membrane. This ultimately damages the fungal cell membrane, causing cell death and inhibiting fungal growth.

### Precautions
Given that Sulbentine is no longer marketed, detailed precautions are not readily available through current channels.  However, as a topical antifungal, potential precautions in the past likely included:

* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to azole antifungals or any of Sulbentine's components should avoid use.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding would likely have been approached cautiously and only when the benefits outweighed the potential risks.  A healthcare professional should always be consulted.
* **Interaction with Other Drugs:**  Potential interactions with other medications were likely to have been considered, especially other topically applied treatments.
* **Open Wounds or Broken Skin:**  Application to broken skin or open wounds was likely to be avoided to reduce the risk of irritation and infection.

Consult a healthcare provider for current guidance on treating fungal nail infections.
