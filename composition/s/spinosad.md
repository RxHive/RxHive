# Spinosad
### Generic Name
Spinosad

### Usage
Spinosad is a topical medication used to treat two common parasitic infestations:

*   **Head Lice (Pediculosis capitis):** This is the primary use of spinosad. It effectively kills head lice and their eggs (nits) in individuals aged 6 months and older.

*   **Scabies:** Spinosad is also approved to treat scabies infestations in patients aged 4 years and older. Scabies is caused by a tiny mite that burrows into the skin, causing intense itching.

### Dosage

**Head Lice (Pediculosis capitis):**

*   **Adults and Children ≥6 months:**  A 0.9% spinosad topical suspension is applied to dry hair and scalp.  Enough should be used to thoroughly coat the hair and scalp. The maximum single application may be up to 120 mL, depending on hair length. Leave it on for 10 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with warm water. If live lice are still present 7 days after the initial treatment, a second application can be performed.

**Scabies:**

*   **Adults and Children ≥4 years:** A 0.9% spinosad topical suspension is applied to dry skin from the neck down to the toes (including the soles of the feet). For balding individuals, apply to the forehead, hairline, scalp, and temples. Let it absorb for 10 minutes before dressing.  Leave it on for at least 6 hours before showering or bathing.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Spinosad is for topical use only. Avoid contact with eyes.
*   Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

### How it Works

Spinosad works by binding to specific receptors in the nervous system of lice and mites. This causes excessive excitation of their nerve cells, leading to paralysis and death. Spinosad is believed to kill both the adult parasites and their eggs (nits or larvae in the case of scabies).


### Precautions

*   **Contraindication:** Spinosad is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to spinosad or any component of the formulation.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Spinosad is classified as a Category B drug during pregnancy. This means that animal studies have not shown a risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. The decision to use spinosad during breastfeeding should be made carefully, considering the potential risk to the infant and the benefits of treatment for the mother.  Wash spinosad from the breast area before breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure.
*   **Children:** Spinosad is not recommended for children under 6 months of age for head lice due to the potential for increased systemic absorption. For scabies, it is not approved for children under 4 years of age.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not usually necessary for individuals with liver or kidney disease due to the low systemic absorption of spinosad.
*   **Benzyl Alcohol:** Some spinosad formulations contain benzyl alcohol, which can be toxic to newborns and infants.  It should not be used in neonates and infants under 6 months of age.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for spinosad to work?** A:  For head lice, a second treatment may be needed if live lice are seen after 7 days. For scabies, the medication needs to be left on for at least 6 hours. Complete eradication of the infestation may take several days or weeks as the life cycle of the parasites is addressed.
*   **Q: Can I use spinosad with other medications?** A: Currently, no significant interactions have been reported, but always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
*   **Q: How should I store spinosad?** A: Store spinosad at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.
*   **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get spinosad in my eyes?** A: Rinse your eyes thoroughly with water immediately. If irritation persists, contact your doctor.
*   **Q: Is spinosad safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: While spinosad is classified as category B in pregnancy, discuss its use with your doctor to weigh the risks and benefits. For breastfeeding, wash the area before feeding to minimize infant exposure.
