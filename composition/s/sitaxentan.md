# Sitaxentan
### Generic Name
Sitaxentan

### Usage
Sitaxentan was a medication used to treat pulmonary hypertension (PH), specifically in patients classified as functional class III.  This means it was prescribed for individuals with PH whose symptoms significantly limited their physical activity.  It's crucial to understand that Sitaxentan is no longer available on the market due to safety concerns.

### Dosage
Because Sitaxentan is no longer available, specific dosage information is for historical reference only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.  The dosage would have varied depending on the patient's individual condition and response to treatment.  It was typically administered orally.  Precise dosing regimens, including for children and individuals with varying levels of liver or kidney function, would have been determined by a physician.

### Side Effects
Sitaxentan, while showing promise in treating pulmonary hypertension, carried a significant risk of serious side effects.  The most concerning was idiosyncratic liver injury, which could be life-threatening.  Other potential side effects, though less severe, might have included:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Upper respiratory tract infections

**It is vital to emphasize that this list is not exhaustive, and any unusual or concerning side effects should have been immediately reported to a healthcare professional.**

### How it Works
Sitaxentan works by blocking the endothelin A (ET<sub>A</sub>) receptor. Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels), and its action contributes significantly to the high blood pressure characteristic of pulmonary hypertension. By inhibiting the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor, Sitaxentan helps to relax and widen the blood vessels in the lungs, improving blood flow and reducing the strain on the heart.  It had a lesser effect on the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor.

### Precautions
Several significant precautions were associated with Sitaxentan.  The most critical was the risk of serious liver damage, necessitating regular liver function monitoring during treatment.  It was contraindicated in patients with known liver disease.  Interactions with other medications were possible, and a physician should have been informed of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding would have required careful consideration due to the lack of data on the drug's safety in these populations.  The potential for effects on fertility also needed to be evaluated.
