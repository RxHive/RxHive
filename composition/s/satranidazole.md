# Satranidazole
### Generic Name
Satranidazole

### Usage
Satranidazole is an antibiotic primarily used to treat infections caused by certain parasites and anaerobic bacteria.  Its main uses include:

* **Amoebic liver abscess:** This is a serious infection of the liver caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*. Satranidazole effectively targets the amoeba responsible.
* **Giardiasis:** This intestinal infection is caused by the parasite *Giardia lamblia*, leading to diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Satranidazole helps eradicate the parasite.
* **Trichomoniasis:** This sexually transmitted infection is caused by the parasite *Trichomonas vaginalis*. Satranidazole is effective in treating both male and female infections.

While not its primary use, satranidazole possesses broad-spectrum activity against some anaerobic bacteria. However, it's crucial to understand that it's not a first-line treatment for most bacterial infections.  A physician should always determine the appropriate treatment based on a proper diagnosis.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Amoebic liver abscess:** The usual dose is 300 mg twice daily (BID) for 10 days.  This is typically administered orally.
* **Giardiasis and Trichomoniasis:**  A single oral dose of 600 mg is usually sufficient.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of satranidazole in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is contraindicated in neonates and should not be used in children unless specifically prescribed and closely monitored by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a doctor before administering satranidazole to individuals with compromised liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Weakness
* Dizziness
* Palpitations
* Fast heart rate (tachycardia)
* Elevated blood pressure

Less common but more serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or severe symptoms.  The frequency of these side effects is not precisely defined in available information.

### How it Works

Satranidazole belongs to the nitroimidazole class of drugs. It works by disrupting the DNA of anaerobic organisms (organisms that don't require oxygen to survive), such as the parasites and certain bacteria mentioned above.  The drug enters the cells of these organisms and is then reduced by enzymes present only within these cells. This reduction process creates reactive molecules that damage the organism's DNA, ultimately leading to cell death and clearing the infection.  This selective action targets the harmful organisms while minimizing harm to healthy human cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Satranidazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or any of its components, those with blood disorders (blood dyscrasias), pregnant or breastfeeding women, and neonates.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications exist.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking before starting satranidazole.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Satranidazole is strictly contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Other Warnings:** Exercise caution and consult with your physician before using satranidazole if you have a history of liver or kidney problems.
