# Salbutamol + Bromhexine

**Generic Name:** Salbutamol + Bromhexine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat respiratory conditions characterized by both bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways) and excessive mucus production.  It's commonly used for symptomatic relief of cough and shortness of breath associated with:

* **Acute bronchitis:**  Inflammation of the bronchi (airways) often caused by viral or bacterial infection.
* **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations:** Worsening of symptoms in COPD, such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema.
* **Asthma (in some cases):** Though usually not the first-line treatment for asthma, it might be used in conjunction with other asthma medications for specific situations, as determined by a doctor.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Salbutamol-related:** Tremors, palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat), nervousness, headache, muscle cramps, insomnia.  More serious but less common side effects include paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of wheezing), and allergic reactions.
* **Bromhexine-related:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, and in rare cases, liver enzyme abnormalities.  Skin reactions such as rash or itching are also possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Salbutamol:** This is a short-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilator. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways, making it easier to breathe.  It targets specific receptors in the lungs to achieve bronchodilation.
* **Bromhexine:** This is an expectorant. It helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear the lungs.  It achieves this by reducing the viscosity (thickness) of the mucus.  The combined effect provides both bronchodilation and improved mucus clearance.
