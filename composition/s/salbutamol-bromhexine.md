# Salbutamol + Bromhexine
### Generic Name
Salbutamol + Bromhexine

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat symptoms of respiratory illnesses, particularly those involving both bronchospasm (constriction of the airways) and excessive mucus production.  It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* **Acute bronchitis:**  Characterized by inflammation of the bronchi (airways) causing cough, mucus production, and sometimes wheezing.  The Salbutamol component addresses the bronchospasm, while Bromhexine helps thin and loosen the mucus.
* **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations:** While not a long-term treatment for COPD, this combination can help manage acute flare-ups by relieving bronchospasm and improving mucus clearance.  It's typically used in conjunction with other COPD therapies.
* **Other respiratory infections:**  It may be used to treat other conditions accompanied by both airway constriction and increased mucus, though this is less common and depends on physician judgment.


The combination is generally not suitable for treating the underlying cause of respiratory illness but rather focuses on symptom relief.

### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary significantly depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the patient's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  **It is crucial to follow the prescription and dosage instructions provided by the doctor precisely.**  There's no standardized universal dosage.  Information provided below is for illustrative purposes only and should **not** be used as a guide for self-medication.

**Typical adult dosages (example only; this is not a prescription):**  Oral formulations might range from one to two tablets or spoonfuls of syrup several times a day,  as directed by the physician.  Intravenous administration of this specific combination is not typical; Salbutamol and Bromhexine are usually administered separately via IV if necessary.

**Children's dosages:** Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and strictly depend on the child's age and weight.  This must be determined and prescribed by a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare provider.  Never administer adult dosages to children.

**Important Note:**  The precise dosage and frequency must be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and the specific formulation of the medicine.

### How it Works

Salbutamol is a beta-2 agonist.  It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways, widening them and making breathing easier.  This counteracts bronchospasm, a common symptom of respiratory illnesses.

Bromhexine is an expectorant. It helps to thin and loosen the mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear from the lungs.  This improves airway clearance and reduces congestion.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to either Salbutamol or Bromhexine.  Consult a doctor before use if you have any underlying heart conditions, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, or supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before use if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Children:** Pediatric use should be under strict medical supervision.
