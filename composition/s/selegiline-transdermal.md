# Selegiline (Transdermal)
### Generic Name
Selegiline (Transdermal)

### Usage
Selegiline transdermal patch is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's important to note that selegiline is *not* approved for treating bipolar depression.  This medication works differently than many other antidepressants and is a type of monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).

### Dosage

**Adults (Major Depressive Disorder):**

* The initial and target dose is typically 6 mg per 24 hours, applied once daily.
* Dosage increases should be done gradually.  The physician may increase the dose in increments of 3 mg per 24 hours (up to a maximum of 12 mg per 24 hours), but only after intervals of at least two weeks, based on individual response and clinical judgment.

**Children and Adolescents:**

The safety and efficacy of selegiline transdermal patches have not been established in children and adolescents aged 12-17 years.  Use in children under 12 is contraindicated due to the risk of a hypertensive crisis.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically needed.  However, for severe hepatic impairment,  dosage adjustments are not provided in the manufacturer's labeling because it hasn't been studied in this population.
* **Renal Impairment:** For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is necessary.  For eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m² or those with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, dosage adjustments aren't specified in the manufacturer's labeling as it hasn't been studied.
* **Geriatric Use:** The recommended dose for older adults (65 years and older) is usually 6 mg per 24 hours daily.


**Administration:**  Selegiline is administered via a transdermal patch. The patch should be applied to clean, dry, intact skin on the upper torso (below the neck and above the waist), upper thigh, or outer arm.  Apply only one patch at a time, and avoid areas with hair, oil, irritation, broken skin, scars, or calluses.  Rotate application sites daily.  Wash hands thoroughly after handling the patch. The patch should be worn for 24 hours and then carefully removed.

### How it Works

Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor. MAO is an enzyme that breaks down certain neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. By inhibiting MAO, selegiline increases the levels of these neurotransmitters, potentially improving mood and alleviating symptoms of depression. The exact mechanism by which selegiline exerts its antidepressant effect is not fully understood.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to selegiline or any component of the formulation.
* Concomitant use with several other medications, including SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs (certain types), opioid analgesics (certain types), and dextromethorphan (due to risk of serotonin syndrome).
* Concomitant use with carbamazepine (increased risk of hypertensive crisis).
* Patients under 12 years of age.
* Patients with pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland).
* General anesthesia.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in young adults. Close monitoring is crucial, particularly at the beginning of treatment or when doses are adjusted.  Family and caregivers should be involved in monitoring.
* Risk of serotonin syndrome when used with other serotonergic medications.
* Risk of elevated blood pressure (hypertensive crisis), especially with tyramine-rich foods. Avoid tyramine-rich foods and beverages, particularly at higher doses.
* Risk of mania or hypomania in patients with bipolar disorder.
* Potential risk of melanoma (skin cancer).  Regular skin examinations are recommended.
* May cause orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing).
* May cause CNS depression.
* Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
* Use with caution in patients with a history of mania.


**Drug Interactions:** Selegiline can interact with many drugs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Selegiline is categorized as pregnancy category C. The effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  It is also unknown whether selegiline is excreted in breast milk; a decision should be made regarding breastfeeding or medication use based on the mother's needs.
