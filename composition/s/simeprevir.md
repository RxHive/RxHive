# Simeprevir
### Generic Name
Simeprevir

### Usage
Simeprevir is a protease inhibitor used specifically to treat chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection.  It's crucial to understand that simeprevir is *not* used as a standalone medication.  It's always administered in combination with other antiviral medications, most commonly sofosbuvir.  This combination therapy targets the virus more effectively than simeprevir alone.  Simeprevir is not recommended for patients who have previously failed treatment with a simeprevir-containing regimen or another regimen including an HCV protease inhibitor.

### Dosage

**Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1:**  The typical adult dose is 150 mg once daily, taken orally. This is always part of a combination regimen. The duration of treatment depends on the presence or absence of cirrhosis (liver scarring).  For those without cirrhosis, treatment lasts 12 weeks.  For those with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A), treatment is extended to 24 weeks.  

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of simeprevir in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). However, simeprevir is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C).
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 30 mL/min.  Data on dosage adjustments for patients with CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is lacking.  Dialysis is unlikely to significantly remove simeprevir from the body.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Insomnia
* Dizziness
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Skin rash (various types, including erythema, eczema, maculopapular rash, urticaria)
* Increased amylase levels (an enzyme)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Increased serum bilirubin level (with sofosbuvir)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Increased serum lipase level (with sofosbuvir)
* Increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Hepatic failure
* Liver decompensation
* Reactivation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) – this is a serious concern, particularly in patients co-infected with HBV.


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agent. It works by inhibiting the HCV NS3/4A protease, an enzyme essential for the Hepatitis C virus to replicate. By blocking this enzyme, simeprevir prevents the virus from making copies of itself, leading to a reduction in viral load and ultimately, viral clearance.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** While the manufacturer's labeling doesn't list specific contraindications for simeprevir alone,  contraindications for combination therapies (e.g., with ribavirin and peginterferon alfa) apply.
* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of hepatic decompensation and failure, photosensitivity reactions, skin reactions, and potential interactions with other medications, especially those metabolized by the liver.  Simeprevir should be used with caution in patients with diabetes and those taking amiodarone.
* **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation:**  A boxed warning highlights the risk of HBV reactivation in patients co-infected with HCV and HBV.  Testing for HBV is essential before starting simeprevir therapy.  Close monitoring for HBV reactivation is crucial during and after treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Simeprevir can interact with other medications.  Specifically, it may increase serum concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates, and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase simeprevir levels.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting simeprevir.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Simeprevir is not used as monotherapy and combination therapy with ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Breastfeeding is not recommended in the presence of HIV coinfection.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take simeprevir alone?** A: No, simeprevir is always used in combination with other antiviral medications as part of a regimen to treat Hepatitis C.
* **Q: How should I store simeprevir?** A: Store simeprevir as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of simeprevir?** A: Long-term effects are not well-defined, but regular follow-up care is essential to monitor liver health and overall well-being after completing treatment.
* **Q:  Is simeprevir right for everyone with Hepatitis C?** A:  No, simeprevir is specifically for genotype 1 chronic Hepatitis C, and its use depends on several factors, including other health conditions and prior treatment history.  Your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment plan.
