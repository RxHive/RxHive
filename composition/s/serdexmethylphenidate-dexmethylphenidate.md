# Serdexmethylphenidate + Dexmethylphenidate
### Generic Name
Serdexmethylphenidate + Dexmethylphenidate

### Usage
This combination medication is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients aged 6 years and older.  It's not indicated for other conditions.

### Dosage

**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):**

* **Adults (and adolescents 13-17 years):** The typical starting dose is Serdexmethylphenidate 39.2 mg/Dexmethylphenidate 7.8 mg orally once daily (OD) in the morning. After one week, the dose may be increased to Serdexmethylphenidate 52.3 mg/Dexmethylphenidate 10.4 mg OD, if needed.  The maximum recommended dose is Serdexmethylphenidate 52.3 mg/Dexmethylphenidate 10.4 mg OD. Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual response and tolerability; a dose reduction or discontinuation may be necessary if there's paradoxical worsening of symptoms or other adverse reactions.


* **Children (6-12 years):**  The initial dose is Serdexmethylphenidate 39.2 mg/Dexmethylphenidate 7.8 mg OD in the morning.  After one week, this can be increased to Serdexmethylphenidate 52.3 mg/Dexmethylphenidate 10.4 mg OD or decreased to Serdexmethylphenidate 26.1 mg/Dexmethylphenidate 5.2 mg OD, depending on the child's response and how well they tolerate the medication. The maximum dose is Serdexmethylphenidate 52.3 mg/Dexmethylphenidate 10.4 mg OD.

**Administration:** The medication is taken orally once daily in the morning. Capsules can be swallowed whole or opened and sprinkled into applesauce or water (50mL) and consumed immediately. Do not store mixed medication.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturerâ€™s labeling.  However, since minimal unchanged drug is excreted in urine, renal adjustment is generally not considered necessary.  When switching from other methylphenidate products, do not substitute on a milligram-per-milligram basis; discontinue the previous medication and start Serdexmethylphenidate/Dexmethylphenidate according to the initial dosing guidelines.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these side effects is not defined in available information.

* Nervous system effects (e.g., drug abuse, dependence)
* Endocrine and metabolic effects (e.g., weight loss)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal effects (e.g., slowed linear growth)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cardiovascular events (e.g., peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud's disease - reported post-marketing)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Serdexmethylphenidate is a prodrug; this means it's converted into the active drug, dexmethylphenidate, in the body. Dexmethylphenidate is a stimulant that affects the brain by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are crucial for attention and focus; increasing their availability helps improve symptoms of ADHD.  The precise mechanism by which it treats ADHD remains unclear.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Serdexmethylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, methylphenidate, or any components of the medication.
* Concurrent use with, or within 14 days of stopping, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Abuse and Dependence:** This medication has a high potential for abuse and dependence.  Careful monitoring is crucial.
* **Cardiovascular Effects:**  Use caution in patients with hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, or other cardiovascular conditions. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate.
* **Psychiatric Conditions:**  Use caution in patients with pre-existing psychosis or bipolar disorder.  Monitor for worsening of these conditions.
* **Tic Disorders:** Use caution in patients with Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders.  Monitor for worsening or onset of tics.
* **Growth Suppression:**  Monitor height and weight, particularly in children, for potential growth suppression.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** There's limited data on the safety of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.  If breastfeeding, infants should be monitored for effects like agitation, poor appetite, and weight gain issues.

**Drug Interactions:**

* Avoid concomitant use with MAOIs (risk of hypertensive crisis).
* May decrease the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications; monitor blood pressure.
* May increase the risk of sudden blood pressure and heart rate increases during surgery if used with halogenated anesthetics.
* Combined use with risperidone may increase extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS); monitor for EPS.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.  Specifically, avoid MAOIs.
