# Safinamide
### Generic Name
Safinamide

### Usage
Safinamide is used as an add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in adults with Parkinson's disease who experience "off" episodes.  "Off" episodes refer to periods where the effects of Parkinson's medication wear off, leading to a return of symptoms. Safinamide is *not* effective as a standalone treatment for Parkinson's disease.

### Dosage

**Parkinson's Disease (Adult):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is 50 mg once daily (OD).
* After two weeks, the doctor may increase the dose to 100 mg OD, depending on how well the patient tolerates the medication and their individual needs.
* **Discontinuation:**  If stopping Safinamide, the dose should be gradually reduced to 50 mg for one week before completely discontinuing.
* **Missed Dose:** If a dose is missed, take the next dose at the usual time the following day.  Do not double the dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:**
The safety and effectiveness of Safinamide in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**
    * Mild (Child-Pugh class A): No dosage adjustment is needed.
    * Moderate (Child-Pugh class B): The maximum dose is 50 mg OD.
    * Severe (Child-Pugh class C): Safinamide is contraindicated (not recommended).  If a patient on 50 mg develops severe hepatic impairment, the medication should be stopped immediately.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer.

### How it Works

Safinamide's exact mechanism in treating Parkinson's disease isn't fully understood. However, it's known to inhibit monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain. By inhibiting MAO-B, Safinamide increases the levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement and coordination, thereby potentially improving symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

### Precautions

**Contraindications (Safinamide should not be used if):**

* You have a history of hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to Safinamide.
* You are taking other MAO inhibitors or potent MAO inhibitors like linezolid.
* You are taking opioids, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants, triazolopyridine antidepressants, or St. John's Wort.
* You have severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* You have albinism, retinal degeneration, uveitis, inherited retinopathy, or any active retinopathy.

**Warnings and Increased Risk:**

* Safinamide may increase blood pressure or worsen existing hypertension.
* There's an increased risk of serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition) when used with certain medications.
* There's a risk of falling asleep unexpectedly, particularly at higher doses.
* Safinamide may worsen existing dyskinesia or cause new dyskinesia.
* There is a risk of hallucinations, psychotic behavior, and impulse control/compulsive behaviors.

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
* In patients with a history of ophthalmic (eye) disorders.
