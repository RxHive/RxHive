# Suxamethonium

**Generic Name:** Suxamethonium chloride (also known as succinylcholine)

**Usage:**

Suxamethonium is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.  Its primary use is to provide short-term muscle relaxation during surgery or other medical procedures, such as intubation (insertion of a breathing tube) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  It causes temporary paralysis of skeletal muscles.  Its short duration of action makes it suitable for procedures where rapid onset and offset of paralysis are needed.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Muscle pain:** This is a frequent complaint after the effects of the drug wear off.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):**  This is due to the effects on the autonomic nervous system.
* **Increased blood pressure (hypertension):** Similar to tachycardia, this is a result of autonomic nervous system stimulation.
* **Malignant hyperthermia (rare but serious):** This is a life-threatening condition characterized by a rapid rise in body temperature, muscle rigidity, and metabolic acidosis.  Genetic predisposition is a factor.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Cardiac arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats.
* **Apnea:** Cessation of breathing (requires artificial ventilation).
* **Hypotension:** Low blood pressure.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though uncommon, allergic reactions are possible.


**How it Works:**

Suxamethonium works by binding to acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.  This initially causes depolarization (a change in the electrical potential across the muscle cell membrane) and muscle contraction. However, unlike acetylcholine, suxamethonium doesn't readily detach from the receptor. This sustained depolarization leads to a blockage of further neuromuscular transmission, resulting in muscle paralysis.  The drug is rapidly metabolized by plasma cholinesterase, leading to its short duration of action (typically 5-10 minutes).


**FAQs:**

* **How long does the effect last?**  The effects typically last 5-10 minutes, but this can vary depending on factors like dosage and individual metabolism.
* **Is it addictive?** No, suxamethonium is not addictive.
* **Can I drive after receiving suxamethonium?** No, you should not drive after receiving suxamethonium due to the potential for muscle weakness and delayed recovery.  You will need to be monitored post-procedure.
* **What are the contraindications?** Contraindications include known allergy to suxamethonium, certain genetic conditions (like atypical cholinesterase), and conditions that could be exacerbated by muscle paralysis or increased heart rate.  Malignant hyperthermia history is a strong contraindication.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Inform your medical team immediately.  Severe side effects require prompt medical attention.
