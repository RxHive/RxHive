# Sertindole
### Generic Name
Sertindole

### Usage
Sertindole is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia in adults.  It's important to note that Sertindole is no longer available in many countries due to concerns regarding its potential to cause cardiac arrhythmias and other serious side effects.  Its use should only be considered under strict medical supervision and in situations where other antipsychotic medications have proven ineffective or intolerable.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Schizophrenia):**  Sertindole is administered orally.  The initial dose is typically 4 mg once daily.  The dose is then gradually increased in increments of 4 mg every 4-5 days, as tolerated, until a maintenance dose of 12-20 mg once daily is reached. The maximum recommended daily dose is 24 mg.  If treatment is interrupted for more than a week, the dose should be re-titrated. Elderly patients and those with mild to moderate hepatic impairment usually require slower dose titration and lower maintenance doses.  Sertindole is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for renal impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   QT prolongation (a serious heart rhythm abnormality)
*   Tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements)
*   Convulsions (seizures)
*   Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
*   Hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels)
*   Peripheral edema (swelling)
*   Dizziness
*   Dry mouth
*   Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)
*   Weight gain
*   Constipation
*   Headache
*   Insomnia
*   Nasal congestion
*   Sexual dysfunction


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include dyspnea (shortness of breath) and rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes).  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Sertindole's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by blocking dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2, and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in the brain. This interaction influences neurotransmitter activity, helping to alleviate the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Its atypical profile suggests a different balance of receptor blockade compared to older antipsychotics, potentially contributing to a reduced risk of certain side effects (although this is partially offset by the risk of cardiac issues with Sertindole).

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Sertindole is contraindicated in individuals with uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, known or family history of congenital long QT syndrome, acquired QT interval prolongation, clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including heart failure, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmias, or bradycardia), severe hepatic impairment, and concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or drugs known to prolong the QT interval.


**Warnings and Precautions:** Sertindole should be used cautiously in patients with Parkinson's disease, a history of seizures, risk factors for stroke, conditions that might elevate core body temperature, risk for aspiration pneumonia, and those who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers.  Elderly patients require careful monitoring.  Avoid abrupt withdrawal.

**Drug Interactions:** Plasma levels of Sertindole can be affected by other medications.  Potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) increase Sertindole levels, while CYP inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) decrease them.
