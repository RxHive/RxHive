# Sumatriptan
### Generic Name
Sumatriptan

### Usage
Sumatriptan is a triptan medication primarily used to treat migraine headaches with or without aura.  It's highly effective at relieving the throbbing pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound that often accompany migraines.  While its primary use is for acute migraine treatment, some formulations might be used to abort cluster headaches in certain cases, though this is less common and should be discussed with a doctor.  Sumatriptan is not a preventative medication; it's designed to relieve symptoms *during* a migraine attack.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the formulation (oral tablet, nasal spray, injection) and the individual's response.  **Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.**  

* **Adults (Oral):**  A typical starting dose is 25-50mg. A second dose can be taken after two hours if needed, but the total daily dose should not exceed 100mg.
* **Adults (Nasal Spray):**  The typical dose is 5-20mg.  Do not exceed the recommended single dose.
* **Adults (Injection):**  The typical dose is 6mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  A second dose can be given after one hour if needed, but no more than 2 doses in 24 hours.

**Children:** Sumatriptan is generally not recommended for children unless specifically prescribed by a pediatric neurologist due to limited research on its safety and effectiveness in this population.

**Important Note:** The specific dosage and administration method should always be determined by a physician based on individual health status, age, and severity of the migraine.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Tingling or warm sensations
* Weakness
* Pressure sensations in the chest or throat (often described as tightness)
* Flushing or warmth in the face, neck, and chest
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious side effects that require immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; hives
* Chest pain or tightness that is severe or prolonged
* Heart attack or stroke (especially in patients with existing heart conditions)
* Seizures


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Sumatriptan works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain. During a migraine, certain blood vessels in the brain widen, which is believed to contribute to the pain. Sumatriptan constricts these vessels, helping to reduce the pain associated with the migraine.  It also blocks the release of substances called neuropeptides, which are involved in the transmission of pain signals in the brain.  By acting on these mechanisms, sumatriptan helps to alleviate the symptoms of a migraine attack.

### Precautions

* **Heart Conditions:** Sumatriptan should be used with extreme caution, or avoided altogether, in individuals with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or a history of stroke.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of sumatriptan during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor to weigh the risks and benefits.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary in individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Sumatriptan can interact with certain medications, including MAO inhibitors, ergotamine-containing medications, and other triptans.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Use with Caution:**  People with hemiplegic migraine (a migraine with weakness or paralysis on one side of the body) should use sumatriptan with caution under close medical supervision.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take sumatriptan every day?** A: No, sumatriptan is for acute migraine treatment, not daily use.  Overuse can lead to medication overuse headaches.
* **Q: How should I store sumatriptan?** A: Store sumatriptan at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Sumatriptan is typically used only when a migraine occurs, so missing a dose isn't relevant unless a doctor prescribed a preventive regimen.  Follow your doctor’s advice.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking sumatriptan?** A: It’s best to avoid alcohol while taking sumatriptan, as it can worsen some side effects.
* **Q: Is sumatriptan addictive?** A: Sumatriptan is not considered an addictive medication in the same way as opioids. However, overuse can lead to medication overuse headaches.
