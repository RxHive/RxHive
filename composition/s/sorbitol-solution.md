# Sorbitol Solution

**Generic Name:** Sorbitol Solution

**Usage:**

Sorbitol solution is primarily used as a laxative to relieve constipation.  It works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and increasing bowel movements.  It can also be used as a sweetening agent in foods and medications, though this isn't its primary medicinal purpose.  It's important to note that it's generally used for occasional constipation, not chronic. Specific dosages should be determined by a doctor or pharmacist.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Abdominal cramping and bloating
* Gas
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea (if taken in large doses)

Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects can include:

* Dehydration (especially in large doses or with inadequate fluid intake)
* Rectal irritation or discomfort
* Allergic reactions (rare)

If any of these side effects become severe or persistent, medical attention should be sought.

**How it Works:**

Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol.  Unlike other sugars, it is poorly absorbed by the intestines. This means a significant portion remains in the gut.  This unabsorbed sorbitol draws water into the intestines via osmosis, increasing stool bulk and softening it.  This increased bulk stimulates bowel movements and relieves constipation.


**FAQs:**

* **Is sorbitol solution safe for everyone?**  While generally considered safe for occasional use, it may not be suitable for individuals with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes (due to its carbohydrate content) or those with fructose malabsorption.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before use.  Children should only use it under adult supervision.
* **How much sorbitol solution should I take?**  Dosage varies depending on age and the severity of constipation. Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.  Do not exceed the recommended dose.
* **What happens if I take too much?**  Excessive intake can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
* **Can I take sorbitol solution long-term?** It's not intended for long-term use.  Chronic constipation should be addressed with a doctor, not just with over-the-counter laxatives.
* **Can I mix sorbitol solution with other medications?**  Check with your pharmacist or doctor to ensure no interactions occur.
* **Does sorbitol solution cause gas?**  Yes, gas and bloating are common side effects.
* **Is sorbitol solution the same as sorbitol?**  While chemically the same, the term "sorbitol solution" typically refers to a liquid formulation used specifically as a laxative or for other medicinal applications, whereas "sorbitol" can refer to various forms, including those used in food.
