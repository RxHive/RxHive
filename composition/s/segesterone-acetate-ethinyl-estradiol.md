# Segesterone acetate + Ethinyl estradiol
### Generic Name
Segesterone Acetate + Ethinyl Estradiol

### Usage

Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) used by women of reproductive age to prevent pregnancy.  It's a combination of a progestin (segesterone acetate) and an estrogen (ethinyl estradiol). This combination works primarily by suppressing ovulation, thus preventing the release of an egg.  The medication is not adequately studied in women with a BMI greater than 29 kg/mÂ².


### Dosage

**Contraception (Intravaginal):**

* **Adults and Postpubertal Adolescents (<18 years):**  One ring (containing 0.15 mg segesterone acetate and 0.013 mg ethinyl estradiol) is inserted vaginally. The ring remains in place for 21 continuous days (3 weeks), then removed for 7 days (1 week). This 3-week on, 1-week off pattern constitutes one cycle. One ring provides contraception for 13 cycles (approximately one year).

**Important Dosage Considerations:**

* **Missed Days:** If the ring is out of the vagina for more than 7 days, backup contraception (such as condoms or spermicide) is necessary until the ring has been in place for 7 consecutive days.
* **Accidental Removal/Expulsion:** If the ring is removed for less than 2 hours, reinsertion is possible without backup contraception.  If the ring is out for more than 2 hours (or a cumulative total of more than 2 hours over multiple expulsions), backup contraception is needed for 7 consecutive days of ring placement.
* **Prolonged Use:** If the ring is left in for more than 21 days, remove it for 7 days, then resume the standard 21/7 cycle.
* **Prolonged Vaginal-Free Interval:** If the ring is out for longer than 7 days, use backup contraception until the ring has been in place for 7 consecutive days.
* **Initiation After Copper IUD Removal:** Insert the ring between days 2 and 5 of the menstrual cycle.  If cycles are irregular or insertion is more than 5 days after the last menstrual bleeding, use backup contraception for the first 7 days.
* **Switching From Other Contraceptives:**  Follow specific instructions based on the previous method used. Consult the prescribing information for details on switching from other hormonal or non-hormonal contraceptives.  Backup contraception may be needed for a short period.
* **Postpartum/Post-abortion/Miscarriage:**  Consult the prescribing information for guidance on when to initiate use after childbirth, abortion, or miscarriage. Backup contraception may be necessary depending on the timing.
* **Enzyme Inducers:**  If taking enzyme inducers (e.g., certain anticonvulsants, rifampin, St. John's Wort), alternative contraception or backup methods are strongly recommended.

### How it Works

Segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol is a combined hormonal contraceptive that works primarily by suppressing ovulation.  The ethinyl estradiol inhibits the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, leading to reduced levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This inhibits follicle maturation and ovulation. Segesterone acetate thickens cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg, and also affects the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, liver tumors, severe liver disease, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, and certain cardiovascular conditions (such as a history of blood clots).  It should not be used by women over 35 who smoke.  Certain interactions with other medications are also contraindicated. Consult prescribing information.
* **Interactions:** This medication can interact with several other drugs, including enzyme inducers, statins, and certain antiviral medications. This can either decrease or increase the effectiveness of the contraceptive or other medication. Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of thromboembolic events, liver disease, hypertension, gallbladder disease, and other adverse metabolic effects.  Use with caution in women with a history of depression or diabetes.  This medication does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Not for use during pregnancy.  It can reduce milk production and is not recommended during breastfeeding until weaning.
