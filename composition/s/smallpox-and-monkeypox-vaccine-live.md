# Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine (Live)
### Generic Name
Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine (Live)

### Usage
This live attenuated vaccine is indicated for preventing smallpox and monkeypox in adults aged 18 years and older who are considered at high risk of infection.  This is a primary immunization strategy and is not a treatment for active infection.

### Dosage
**Adults (18 years and older):**  The recommended dosage is two subcutaneous (SubQ) injections of 0.5 mL each, administered 4 weeks apart.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of this vaccine have not been established in individuals under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of individuals):**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Chills
* Nausea
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Pain, erythema (redness), swelling, induration (hardening), and itching at the injection site

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of individuals):**

* Cardiac disorders
* Fever

**Rare Side Effects (occurring in <1% of individuals):**

* ECG abnormalities (including abnormal T-waves, increased ST segment, T-wave inversion)
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Increased troponin levels (indicative of potential heart muscle damage)


**Important Note:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects or allergic reactions such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or severe rash.

### How it Works
The Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine (Live) uses a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus.  MVA is a replication-deficient virus; meaning it cannot cause disease or reproduce in human cells.  Despite this, it still triggers a robust immune response in the body. The vaccine elicits both humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular immune responses, providing protection against orthopoxviruses like smallpox and monkeypox.  This immune response prepares the body to effectively fight off these viruses if exposed.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  The manufacturer's labeling currently does not list specific contraindications. However,  there is an increased risk of adverse events for those with severe allergic reactions, altered immunocompetence, and a history of syncope (fainting).

**Interactions:**  The effectiveness of this vaccine may be reduced when used concurrently with immunosuppressants or brincidofovir.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

**Warnings:**

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Live virus vaccines are generally not recommended during pregnancy.  The potential benefits of vaccination should be weighed against the potential risks to the fetus. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so the benefits of breastfeeding must be considered alongside potential risks to the infant.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  Vaccination might not produce effective immunity in individuals with severely compromised immune systems.  Consult your doctor before vaccination if you have any condition affecting your immune system.
* **Syncope:**  Patients should be seated or lying down during and immediately following vaccination to minimize the risk of fainting and injury.
