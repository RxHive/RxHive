# Selenium Sulphide

**Generic Name:** Selenium Sulfide

**Usage:**

Selenium sulfide is an antifungal and antiparasitic medication used topically to treat:

* **Seborrheic dermatitis:** A common skin condition causing scaly, itchy patches on the scalp (dandruff) and other areas of the body.
* **Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor):** A fungal infection causing discolored patches on the skin.
* **Pityriasis capitis (seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp):** A type of dandruff characterized by greasy scales.
* **Head lice (Pediculosis capitis):**  Though less common now, it can be used as a pediculicide (lice killer). Note: Permethrin or other specific pediculicide treatments are generally preferred for head lice.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, stinging, redness, itching, dryness, or peeling at the application site.
* **Hair discoloration:** Temporary discoloration of hair, especially light-colored hair.  This usually fades after discontinuation of use.
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, allergic reactions such as rash, hives, or swelling can occur.


**How it Works:**

Selenium sulfide's exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work through several actions:

* **Antifungal activity:** It interferes with the growth and reproduction of fungi, effectively treating fungal skin infections like tinea versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis.
* **Antiparasitic activity (against lice):** It disrupts the metabolism and life cycle of head lice. However, it is less effective than other dedicated pediculicide treatments and may not be the first-line treatment.
* **Anti-inflammatory effects:** While not its primary function, it may have some anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce inflammation associated with seborrheic dermatitis.
