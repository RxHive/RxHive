# Selenium Sulphide
### Generic Name
Selenium Sulphide

### Usage
Selenium sulphide is an antifungal and antiparasitic medication primarily used topically to treat seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff) and tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor).  Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition causing a flaky, itchy scalp. Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection resulting in discolored patches on the skin.  While its primary use focuses on these skin conditions, it may sometimes be used off-label for other fungal skin infections under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  It's crucial to understand that selenium sulphide isn't a cure-all for all fungal skin infections; its effectiveness varies depending on the specific condition and its severity.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation (shampoo, lotion, cream) and the condition being treated.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or as directed by a physician.

**For Seborrheic Dermatitis (Dandruff):**

* **Shampoo:**  Typically, a small amount of selenium sulphide shampoo is applied to wet hair, massaged into the scalp, left on for a few minutes (as per product instructions), and then rinsed thoroughly.  The frequency of use ranges from once or twice a week to once a month, depending on the severity of dandruff and individual response.

* **Lotion/Cream:**  If a lotion or cream formulation is used, a thin layer is applied to the affected area(s) of the scalp, gently massaged in, and then left to absorb.  The frequency of application and duration of treatment will vary depending on the severity of the condition and the specific product instructions.

**For Tinea Versicolor:**

* **Shampoo/Lotion/Cream:**  Application methods are similar to those for seborrheic dermatitis. The product is applied to the affected skin areas, left on for the time specified (usually several minutes), and then rinsed or allowed to dry completely.  Multiple applications over several days or weeks might be necessary to clear the infection, depending on the severity.

**Pediatric Use:**  The use of selenium sulphide in children should always be under the direct supervision of a pediatrician.  The dosage and frequency will be determined based on the child's age and weight.

**IV Administration:**  Selenium sulphide is not administered intravenously (IV). It's solely for topical use.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Mild itching, burning, or redness at the application site.  These are usually temporary and resolve once treatment is stopped.
* **Less Common but Important:**  Dry skin, hair loss (temporary), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), skin discoloration.
* **Serious (Rare):**  Severe allergic reactions requiring immediate medical attention.


If any significant or persistent side effects develop, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Selenium sulphide works by inhibiting the growth of fungi, the causative agent in both seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor.  Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to interfere with the fungi's metabolism, thereby preventing their reproduction and reducing their populations on the skin.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Selenium sulphide should not be used on individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to selenium sulphide or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Although rare, potential interactions with other medications are possible.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe for topical use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, consult a doctor before use to weigh the benefits and risks.
* **Children:**  Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.
* **Avoid contact with eyes:**  In case of accidental eye contact, rinse thoroughly with plenty of water.
