# S-Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Amlodipine/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that relaxes blood vessels, and hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic (water pill) that helps your body get rid of excess salt and water. By working together, they lower blood pressure.  It's important to note that this medication is prescribed for *high blood pressure* and is not indicated for other conditions.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Amlodipine/Hydrochlorothiazide can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A frequent side effect, often mild and temporary.
* **Dizziness:** Can be related to blood pressure changes.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired or weak.
* **Swelling in ankles or feet (edema):** Due to fluid retention.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Flushing:**  Reddening of the skin.
* **Lightheadedness:**  Feeling faint.
* **Palpitations:**  A feeling of rapid or irregular heartbeat.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Muscle cramps:**  Pain or spasms in the muscles.

**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Allergic reactions:**  Such as rash, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (seek immediate medical attention).
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms like jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):**  Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Potassium levels may become low (hypokalemia), potentially leading to muscle weakness or irregular heartbeats.
* **Increased risk of falls (especially in elderly patients):** Due to dizziness or lightheadedness.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  Rare but serious.


**It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.**

**How it Works:**

Amlodipine relaxes the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels, causing them to widen. This reduces the resistance to blood flow, lowering blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the amount of urine your body produces by removing excess salt and water. This also helps lower blood pressure.  The combination of these two drugs provides a more effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone for many patients.
