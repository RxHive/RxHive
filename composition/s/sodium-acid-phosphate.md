# Sodium acid phosphate

**Generic Name:** Sodium Phosphate, Monobasic Monohydrate; Sodium Phosphate, Dibasic Heptahydrate;  (These are two common forms, and the specific sodium phosphate used will depend on the application.  There are other forms as well.)

**Usage:**  Sodium acid phosphate (the term encompasses several related compounds) has a wide range of uses, depending on the specific form and pH:

* **Laxative:**  In higher doses, it's used as a bowel preparation before colonoscopies and other bowel procedures.  This is primarily achieved through the dibasic form.
* **Food additive:**  It acts as a buffering agent, emulsifier, and leavening agent in various foods and beverages.  The monobasic form is more common in this context.
* **pH adjuster:**  Used in industrial and pharmaceutical applications to adjust the pH of solutions.
* **Dental cleaning:**  Sometimes included in dental cleaning products.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects vary depending on the dosage and method of administration, and are more pronounced with laxative use:

* **Laxative Use:**  The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and dehydration.  Severe dehydration can lead to electrolyte imbalances (such as hypokalemia).  Rectal irritation is also possible.  Allergic reactions are rare but possible.
* **Food Additive Use:** Generally considered safe at the levels used in food.


**How it Works:**

* **As a Laxative:**  Sodium phosphates, primarily the dibasic form, work by drawing water into the intestines, increasing stool bulk and stimulating bowel movements. This osmotic effect helps clear the bowel.
* **As a Food Additive:**  The monobasic form acts as a buffer, helping to maintain a stable pH in processed foods.  The specific mechanisms depend on its use in the food (e.g., leavening, emulsifying).
* **As a pH Adjuster:**  It acts as an acid or base (depending on the form) to bring the pH of a solution to the desired level.


**FAQs:**

* **Is sodium acid phosphate safe?**  When used as directed and at appropriate levels, it's generally considered safe. However, exceeding recommended dosages or using it inappropriately can cause serious side effects, particularly with laxative use.
* **Can I take sodium acid phosphate regularly?**  No,  it should not be used regularly as a laxative.  Chronic use can lead to mineral imbalances and other health problems.
* **Who should avoid sodium acid phosphate?**  Individuals with kidney disease, heart disease, or those who are dehydrated should avoid using sodium phosphate as a laxative without consulting their doctor.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their physician before use.
* **What are the differences between monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate?**  Monobasic sodium phosphate is more acidic and commonly used as a food additive or pH adjuster. Dibasic sodium phosphate is more basic and is the form usually used as a laxative.  They have different chemical properties and uses.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience severe or persistent side effects, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.
