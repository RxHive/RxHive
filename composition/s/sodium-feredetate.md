# Sodium Feredetate
### Generic Name
Sodium Feredate

### Usage

Sodium feredate is an iron supplement used primarily to treat iron-deficiency anemia in specific populations.  These populations include pediatric patients, pregnant women who cannot tolerate oral iron supplements, and individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.  It's also used for the prevention of iron-deficiency anemia in children.  The medication works by providing readily absorbable iron to help the body produce hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.  Iron deficiency leads to a decrease in hemoglobin, resulting in anemia and associated symptoms like fatigue and weakness.  Sodium feredate helps replenish iron stores, allowing the body to produce more hemoglobin and alleviate these symptoms.


### Dosage

Dosage is determined by the patient's age, weight, and the severity of their iron deficiency.  It's crucial to follow the prescription provided by a healthcare professional.  Dosage is always expressed as elemental iron.

**Adults (Iron-deficiency anemia treatment):**

* Oral:  The usual starting dose is 27.5 mg (5 mL) three times daily (TID). This dose may be gradually increased to 55 mg (10 mL) TID as directed by a doctor.

**Pediatric (Iron-deficiency anemia treatment):**

* Oral: 3-6 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses.  The maximum daily dose is 200 mg.

**Pediatric (Iron-deficiency anemia prevention):**

* Oral:  Dosage varies significantly based on age and weight.  Infants (especially low birth weight, exclusively breastfed) may require 5 mg/day, potentially increasing to 2 mg/kg/day, starting 4-6 weeks after birth.  Older children require higher doses, ranging from 12.5 mg/day (6-24 months) to 60 mg/day (12 years and older).

**Dosage Adjustments:** The provided information does not include specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. Consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild, but some individuals may experience:

* Diarrhea (mild)
* Nausea
* Hypersensitivity reactions

Serious side effects are less frequent but should be reported to a doctor immediately. If any adverse effects occur, seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Sodium feredate is a chelated form of iron.  It's complexed with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), a chelating agent.  This complex helps protect the iron from interaction with other substances in the gastrointestinal tract. Inside the digestive system, the complex breaks down, releasing iron for absorption into the body. The absorbed iron is then used to produce hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells, thereby treating or preventing iron-deficiency anemia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Sodium feredate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, hemochromatosis (iron overload), hemosiderosis (excess iron deposition), and those receiving multiple blood transfusions or parenteral iron therapy.
* **Increased Risk:** Dark or black stools are a common, expected effect.
* **Caution:**  Use with caution in pediatric patients and those with known iron-absorption or iron-storage disorders.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sodium feredate is considered safe for use during pregnancy when oral iron alternatives are not tolerated, but always consult with a healthcare professional. The excretion of sodium feredate in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Though not explicitly listed, it is important to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking to avoid potential interactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take sodium feredate with other medications?** A: Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store sodium feredate?** A: Store as directed on the product label. If diluted with water, do not store for more than 14 days.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is sodium feredate safe for everyone?** A: No, it is contraindicated for individuals with certain conditions (see Precautions). Consult a healthcare professional before use.
* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.
