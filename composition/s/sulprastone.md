# Sulprastone
### Generic Name
Sulprostone

### Usage
Sulprostone is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 derivative primarily used for its uterine stimulant effects. Its main applications include:

* **Cervical dilatation:**  Before surgical termination of pregnancy during the first trimester, Sulprostone helps soften and dilate the cervix, making the procedure easier.
* **Medical termination of pregnancy:**  In the first or second trimester, Sulprostone can be used to induce and complete a medical abortion.
* **Uterine emptying:**  It aids in emptying the uterus in cases of missed miscarriage (where the fetus has died but is not expelled), hydatidiform mole (a rare pregnancy complication), and intrauterine fetal death.
* **Postpartum hemorrhage control:** When other treatments like oxytocin have failed to control postpartum bleeding, Sulprostone can be used to stimulate uterine contractions and reduce bleeding.


### Dosage
Sulprostone is administered intravenously (IV) as an infusion.  Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific indication and the patient's response.  **It is crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.**  The following are general guidelines only and should not be interpreted as a prescription:

* **Cervical dilatation (1st trimester):** 500 mcg administered over 3-6 hours.
* **Termination of pregnancy (1st or 2nd trimester):**  100 mcg/hour for up to 10 hours, with potential increases to 500 mcg/hour if necessary. The maximum total dose in 24 hours is 1.5 mg.  A second course may be considered 12-24 hours after the first if the first is unsuccessful.
* **Postpartum hemorrhage:**  Starts at 100 mcg/hour, potentially increasing to 500 mcg/hour as needed. Maintenance is typically 100 mcg/hour. The maximum 24-hour dose is 1.5 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Sulprostone is contraindicated in patients with active hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) disease.  No specific dosage adjustments are made for age or weight, but careful monitoring is essential for all patients.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Flushing (reddening of the skin)
* Fever
* Rash

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways)
* Convulsion (seizure)
* Uterine rupture
* Sudden cardiovascular collapse
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

**Any adverse effects, especially serious ones, should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.**


### How it Works
Sulprostone is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 analogue, primarily acting as an agonist at EP3 receptors in the uterus.  This stimulation causes the uterine muscles to contract more forcefully and frequently.  This effect is responsible for its use in cervical dilatation, uterine emptying, and controlling postpartum hemorrhage.


### Precautions
Sulprostone is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to Sulprostone or related compounds.
* Active pelvic infection.
* History of pelvic inflammatory disease.
* Active cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease.
* Smoking (current or within the past 2 years).


Use with caution in patients with:

* Glaucoma or raised intraocular pressure.
* Pre-existing or history of asthma.
* Pre-existing or history of epilepsy.
* Cardiovascular disease.

**Careful monitoring of cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure, heart rate) is essential before and after administration.**


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Sulprostone stored?**  A: Storage instructions should be found on the medication packaging. Generally, it needs to be stored according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
* **Q: Can I take other medications while using Sulprostone?** A:  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal) you are taking, as interactions are possible.  For example, it potentiates the effects of oxytocin.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Since Sulprostone is typically administered intravenously by a healthcare professional in a controlled setting, missing a dose is unlikely. Contact your physician if you have concerns.
* **Q: Is Sulprostone safe during pregnancy?** A:  The use of Sulprostone during pregnancy is highly specific and is usually only used to terminate a pregnancy or manage complications.  It should only be used under strict medical supervision.  The pregnancy category is unknown.
* **Q: Is Sulprostone safe for breastfeeding mothers?** A: It's unknown whether Sulprostone is excreted in breast milk. Consult your doctor regarding breastfeeding while using this medication.
