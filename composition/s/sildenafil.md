# Sildenafil
### Generic Name
Sildenafil

### Usage

Sildenafil is primarily a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor used to treat two distinct conditions:

* **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH):** Sildenafil improves exercise capacity and delays clinical worsening in patients with PAH (WHO Group I), particularly those with NYHA Functional Class II-III symptoms.  It works by relaxing the blood vessels in the lungs, reducing blood pressure within the pulmonary arteries.

* **Erectile Dysfunction (ED):** Sildenafil aids in achieving and maintaining an erection in men with ED.  It facilitates the response to sexual stimulation by increasing blood flow to the penis.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH):**

* **Oral:**  The starting dose is typically 20mg twice daily,  increased gradually based on individual response and tolerance.  The drug may also be administered as a suspension. Doses should be administered 4-6 hours apart.

* **Intravenous (IV):**  Used for patients currently on oral Sildenafil who are temporarily unable to take oral medication. The dose is usually 2.5mg or 10mg three times a day, administered as an intravenous bolus.

**Erectile Dysfunction (ED):**

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose is 50mg taken orally about one hour before sexual activity, as needed.  The dose can be increased to a maximum of 100mg or decreased to 25mg depending on efficacy and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose is 100mg per day.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages are complex and vary greatly by age, weight, and specific condition (e.g., PAH associated with congenital heart defects).  Precise dosing instructions must be obtained from a healthcare professional specializing in pediatric cardiology or pulmonology.  Dosages for PAH may involve IV or oral administration with careful titration according to response.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Flushing
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Visual disturbances (blurred vision, color changes, sensitivity to light)
* Nasal congestion
* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Prolonged or painful erection (priapism) – seek immediate medical attention.
* Sudden decrease or loss of vision – seek immediate medical attention.
* Sudden decrease or loss of hearing – seek immediate medical attention.
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing) – seek immediate medical attention.
* Heart attack or stroke – seek immediate medical attention.


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Sildenafil works by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5).  PDE5 breaks down cyclic GMP (cGMP), a molecule that relaxes blood vessels. By inhibiting PDE5, Sildenafil increases cGMP levels, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels).

In PAH, this vasodilation reduces pulmonary artery pressure, improving blood flow to the lungs. In ED, increased blood flow to the penis facilitates an erection in response to sexual stimulation.  Note that Sildenafil does not directly cause an erection but enhances the body's natural response to sexual stimulation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, those taking organic nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin), riociguat, or with certain severe cardiovascular conditions.  It's also contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment, those with a history of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), and some cases of pulmonary hypertension (such as secondary to sickle cell anemia).  Concurrent use with protease inhibitors requires special consideration.


* **Drug Interactions:** Sildenafil can interact with several medications, including other blood pressure medications, nitrates, and some antifungal and antibiotic drugs. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


* **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in patients with bleeding disorders, heart conditions, kidney disease, liver disease, anatomical deformities of the penis, retinitis pigmentosa, or those at risk for priapism. The safety of Sildenafil during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.


* **Other Precautions:**  Avoid alcohol and grapefruit juice, which can affect Sildenafil's metabolism.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take Sildenafil to work?** A: For PAH, the effects are gradual and build over time with regular use. For ED, the effect usually occurs within 30 minutes to 4 hours after taking the medication.


* **Q: How should I store Sildenafil?** A: Store Sildenafil at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.


* **Q: Can I take Sildenafil every day?** A: For PAH, daily dosing is common.  For ED, it's usually taken only as needed.  Never exceed the recommended dose without consulting a doctor.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: For PAH, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time of your next dose. Do not double the dose.  For ED, take it as soon as possible when you anticipate sexual activity.


* **Q:  Is Sildenafil addictive?** A: No, Sildenafil is not considered an addictive substance.
