# Sodium Picosulfate

**Generic Name:** Sodium Picosulfate

**Usage:** Sodium picosulfate is a stimulant laxative used to treat constipation.  It's often used for bowel preparation before colonoscopies or other bowel examinations.  It may also be used to relieve occasional constipation.  It is available over-the-counter in many countries but should be used as directed.  Always consult a doctor before using it regularly or if constipation persists.

**Side Effects:** While generally well-tolerated, sodium picosulfate can cause some side effects, including:

* **Abdominal cramps:** This is a common side effect, often mild and transient.
* **Diarrhea:**  This can range from mild to severe and is a direct effect of its stimulant properties.  Severe diarrhea can lead to dehydration.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach is a possibility.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Prolonged or severe diarrhea can disrupt electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, etc.), particularly dangerous for individuals with pre-existing conditions.
* **Dehydration:**  Loss of fluids from diarrhea can lead to dehydration, especially in elderly patients or those with underlying health problems.
* **Rectal irritation:** Some individuals may experience irritation or discomfort in the rectum.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, allergic reactions such as skin rash or hives are possible.


**How it Works:** Sodium picosulfate is a stimulant laxative. It works by stimulating the muscles in the intestines, increasing their contractions and thereby promoting bowel movements. It does this by increasing fluid secretion into the bowel, softening the stool and making it easier to pass.  It primarily works in the large intestine (colon).
