# Sulphacetamide + Boric Acid + Phenylephrine + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate

**Generic Name:** Sulfacetamide + Boric Acid + Phenylephrine + Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate

**Usage:** This combination is typically found in ophthalmic solutions (eye drops) used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other bacterial infections of the eye.  The specific roles of each ingredient are:

* **Sulfacetamide:** An antibiotic that fights bacterial infections.
* **Boric Acid:** A mild antiseptic that helps to clean and soothe the eye.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the eye, reducing redness and swelling.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** An astringent that helps to reduce inflammation and discharge.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the concentration of ingredients. Possible side effects include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, or itching.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Redness, swelling, itching of the eyelids or surrounding skin.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.
* **Temporary blurred vision:** Usually resolves quickly.
* **Headache:** In rare cases.
* **Other:**  Sensitivity to light (photophobia).


**How it Works:**

The combination works synergistically to treat bacterial eye infections. Sulfacetamide targets and kills the bacteria causing the infection.  Boric acid provides antiseptic action, helping to control the bacterial load. Phenylephrine reduces the redness and swelling associated with the infection, while zinc sulfate helps to reduce inflammation and discharge.
