# Salicylic Acid + Urea

**Generic Name:** Salicylic Acid + Urea Cream/Lotion/Ointment (various concentrations available)

**Usage:**  This combination is primarily used to treat dry, rough, scaly skin conditions.  Specific uses include:

* **Keratolysis:**  Breaking down and removing dead skin cells. This is helpful for conditions where excessive buildup of dead skin is a problem.
* **Psoriasis:**  Managing mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by reducing scaling and inflammation.
* **Xerosis (dry skin):**  Improving skin hydration and reducing dryness, roughness, and scaling.
* **Ichthyosis:**  Improving the appearance and texture of skin affected by ichthyosis, a group of inherited skin disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin.
* **Calluses and corns:**  Softening and removing calluses and corns (often higher concentration formulations).
* **Acne:**  Salicylic acid component helps unclog pores and reduce acne breakouts.  However, this is usually a secondary benefit compared to the moisturizing and exfoliating properties of the combination.


**Side Effects:**  Generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects can include:

* **Skin irritation:**  Burning, stinging, redness, or dryness at the application site, especially with higher concentrations.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible in individuals sensitive to salicylic acid or urea.  Symptoms may include rash, itching, or swelling.
* **Increased sun sensitivity:**  Salicylic acid can make skin more sensitive to sunlight, so sunscreen is recommended, especially during sun exposure.
* **Thinning of the skin (with long-term use and high concentrations):**  This is a concern mainly with prolonged use of high concentrations, so it's important to follow the prescribed dosage and duration.


**How it Works:**

* **Salicylic acid:** Acts as a keratolytic agent, meaning it helps break down the bonds between dead skin cells, allowing them to shed more easily. It also possesses mild anti-inflammatory properties and can help unclog pores.
* **Urea:**  A humectant, drawing moisture into the skin from the environment and helping to improve hydration.  It also has keratolytic properties, further assisting in the removal of dead skin cells. The combination of salicylic acid and urea provides both exfoliation and moisturizing action for more effective treatment of dry, scaly skin.
