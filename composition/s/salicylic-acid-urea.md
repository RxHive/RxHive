# Salicylic Acid + Urea
### Generic Name
Salicylic Acid + Urea

### Usage
Salicylic acid and urea combination topical products are primarily used to treat dry, rough, and scaly skin conditions.  Their combined action makes them highly effective in managing several dermatological issues.  The primary use is in the treatment of keratosis pilaris (KP), a common skin condition characterized by small, bumpy, rough patches, often on the arms and thighs.  It's also frequently used for xerosis (excessive dryness of the skin), ichthyosis vulgaris (a genetic skin disorder causing dry, scaly skin), and psoriasis (a chronic autoimmune disease causing raised, red, scaly patches). Secondary uses can include managing mild cases of acne vulgaris by helping to unclog pores and exfoliate dead skin cells.  It is important to note that this combination is for topical use only and is not suitable for internal consumption.

### Dosage
Dosage depends on the specific product formulation (cream, lotion, ointment) and the concentration of salicylic acid and urea.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label.  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the affected area once or twice daily, as directed by a healthcare professional.  There are no established IV forms of this combination treatment. Pediatric dosage should be determined by a doctor, as it may vary based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of their condition. For infants and young children, lower concentrations might be recommended.  Adult dosage will also vary based on the specific product and the area being treated.  Always consult a physician or pharmacist for guidance on proper application and frequency.


### Side Effects
* **Common side effects:** Mild skin irritation (redness, burning, stinging), dryness, peeling.
* **Less common but serious side effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), increased skin sensitivity to sunlight.  Rare cases of salicylate toxicity can occur with excessive absorption, particularly with very high concentrations or large surface areas of application.  Symptoms of toxicity can include ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.
* **Important Note:** If you experience any significant side effects or if symptoms worsen, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that acts as a keratolytic, meaning it helps to break down and shed dead skin cells.  This exfoliating action helps to unclog pores and smooth the skin's surface.  Urea is a humectant and keratolytic agent. It draws moisture into the skin, improving hydration and softening the hardened, scaly patches. The combination of salicylic acid and urea provides synergistic effects; the salicylic acid helps to remove the dead skin cells, while the urea helps to moisturize and prevent dryness. This combination promotes smoother, healthier-looking skin.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Avoid use on broken or irritated skin, open wounds, or areas of active infection. This combination should not be used by individuals with known allergies to salicylic acid or urea.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While not typically associated with significant drug interactions, inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking.
* **Warnings for Vulnerable Groups:** Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this product.  Children should only use this product under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider. Older adults may have more sensitive skin and should use lower concentrations or apply less frequently.
