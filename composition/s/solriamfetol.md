# Solriamfetol
### Generic Name
Solriamfetol

### Usage
Solriamfetol is used to improve wakefulness in adults with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) related to narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  It's crucial to understand that Solriamfetol doesn't treat the underlying airway obstruction in OSA;  patients should receive treatment for this condition for at least a month before and during Solriamfetol therapy.  The primary use is to alleviate EDS, a significant symptom affecting daily life in both narcolepsy and OSA.


### Dosage
**Adults:**

* **Narcolepsy:** The starting dose is 75 mg once daily (OD) upon waking.  This can be increased to a maximum of 150 mg/day after at least 3 days, depending on individual response and tolerance.  The dosage increase should be done gradually.

* **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):**  The initial dose is 37.5 mg OD upon waking.  This may be doubled to a maximum of 150 mg/day after at least 3 days, based on response and tolerability.  Again, dosage adjustments are gradual.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Solriamfetol in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed according to the manufacturer's prescribing information.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary. For moderate impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m²), start with 37.5 mg OD and increase gradually to a maximum of 75 mg/day after at least 7 days. For severe impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m²), the maximum dose is 37.5 mg/day.  Solriamfetol is not recommended for those with end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m²).

**Administration:** Solriamfetol is taken orally, once daily upon awakening.  It should not be taken within 9 hours of planned bedtime due to potential sleep interference.

### How it Works
Solriamfetol's precise mechanism isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to work by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters involved in regulating wakefulness and alertness. By affecting these neurotransmitters, it's thought to promote wakefulness and reduce EDS.


### Precautions
* **Contraindicated:**  Solriamfetol should not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 14 days of stopping MAOI treatment.
* **Increased Risk:** Solriamfetol may increase blood pressure and heart rate (dose-dependent).  It may also increase the risk of psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, and irritability.
* **Use with Caution:**  It should be used cautiously in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, pre-existing hypertension, advanced age, psychosis, or bipolar disorders. Patients with renal impairment require dosage adjustments.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The risks of Solriamfetol during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown.  Discuss these risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication.  Infants exposed to Solriamfetol should be monitored for adverse effects such as agitation, poor appetite, insomnia, and reduced weight gain.
* **Potential for Abuse:** Solriamfetol has a potential for abuse. Close monitoring is needed for patients with a history of substance abuse.
