**Usage:** Selexipag is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  It's specifically indicated to improve exercise capacity and delay clinical worsening in patients with PAH classified as WHO functional class II and III.  It's usually used in combination with other PAH therapies.

**Side Effects:**  Selexipag, like many medications, can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Syncope (fainting):** Loss of consciousness.


It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Selexipag is a prostacyclin receptor agonist.  Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring substance that helps relax and widen blood vessels in the lungs.  By activating prostacyclin receptors, selexipag helps improve blood flow to the lungs, reducing pressure in the pulmonary arteries and improving exercise capacity in patients with PAH.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Selexipag with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  Selexipag may interact with other drugs, particularly those affecting the liver or kidneys.  Your doctor will determine if it's safe to combine Selexipag with your other medications.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about missed doses.

* **Q: What are the precautions before starting Selexipag?** A: Your doctor will assess your overall health, including kidney and liver function, before prescribing Selexipag.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications.  Patients with a history of certain heart conditions may also need close monitoring.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Selexipag?** A:  The duration of treatment will depend on your individual response and clinical condition. Your doctor will regularly monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.  This is a long-term medication for managing PAH.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or concerning side effects, or if side effects significantly impact your daily life.  Your doctor may adjust the dosage or recommend alternative treatment options.
