# Selexipag
### Generic Name
Selexipag

### Usage
Selexipag is primarily used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), specifically WHO Group I PAH.  It's prescribed to help slow disease progression, reduce the risk of hospitalization related to PAH exacerbations, and improve overall quality of life for patients with this condition.  While not a primary indication, it plays a role in managing the symptoms associated with PAH.

### Dosage
**Adults (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension):** Selexipag is administered orally. The starting dose is typically 200 mcg twice daily (BID).  The dose is then gradually increased, usually at weekly intervals, in increments of 200 mcg BID, to the highest tolerated dose, with a maximum of 1600 mcg BID.  If a dose is not tolerated, it should be reduced to the previously tolerated dose.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on hepatic impairment; refer to the "Dosage Adjustments" section below.  A physician specializing in pulmonary arterial hypertension should oversee all dosing decisions.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Selexipag in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), no dosage adjustment is needed. For moderate impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the initial dose is 200 mcg once daily (OD), gradually increasing by 200 mcg OD weekly as tolerated. Selexipag should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
* **Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m² or those undergoing dialysis. However, close monitoring is advised in these populations.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Flushing
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Jaw pain
* Limb pain
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Decreased appetite
* Hyperthyroidism
* Anemia (decreased hemoglobin levels)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Symptomatic hypotension (low blood pressure)

**Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Selexipag is a selective prostacyclin IP receptor agonist. Prostacyclin is a naturally occurring substance that helps relax blood vessels (vasodilation) and inhibits platelet aggregation (blood clotting). In PAH, the body doesn't produce enough prostacyclin, leading to constricted blood vessels and increased clotting. Selexipag works by mimicking the effects of prostacyclin, improving blood flow in the lungs and reducing the strain on the heart.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Selexipag or any of its ingredients.
* Concomitant use with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil).

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD).
* Use with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.

**Interactions:**  Moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors may increase Selexipag's active metabolite levels; dose reduction might be necessary. Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Selexipag is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Women with PAH should ideally avoid pregnancy. It's unknown whether Selexipag is excreted in breast milk, requiring careful consideration before breastfeeding while using this medication.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Selexipag with food?** A: Yes, Selexipag can be taken with or without food, although taking it with food may improve tolerability.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible unless the next dose is within 6 hours. If you miss more than 3 days of treatment, consult your doctor before restarting.
* **Q: How should I store Selexipag?** A: Store Selexipag at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q:  Are there any specific monitoring requirements while on Selexipag?** A: Yes, your doctor will likely monitor your liver and thyroid function tests regularly.  They will also assess your pulmonary function, exercise tolerance, and quality of life to gauge the treatment's effectiveness.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience serious side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe or persistent side effects, such as severe headache, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or significant swelling.
