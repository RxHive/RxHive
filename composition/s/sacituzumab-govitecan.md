# Sacituzumab Govitecan
### Generic Name
Sacituzumab Govitecan

### Usage

Sacituzumab govitecan is a targeted cancer therapy used to treat adults with specific types of advanced cancers.  Its primary use is in treating adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who have already received at least two prior systemic therapies, with at least one of them being for metastatic disease.  A secondary, notable use is in the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) who have previously undergone platinum-containing chemotherapy and treatment with either a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor.  In essence, it's used in patients whose cancers haven't responded well to other treatments.

### Dosage

Sacituzumab govitecan is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage is calculated based on the patient's body weight at the start of each treatment cycle (or more frequently if their weight changes by more than 10%).  It's crucial to note that this medication should *never* be substituted for or used alongside other drugs containing irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38.

**For both triple-negative breast cancer and urothelial cancer:** The standard dose is 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle.  The maximum dose is 10 mg/kg per dose. Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are not explicitly outlined in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment. However,  considerations need to be made:  Patients with severely impaired liver function (bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal, or AST and ALT >3 times the upper limit of normal, or AST and ALT >5 times the upper limit of normal and associated with liver metastases) may experience increased exposure to SN-38, a metabolite of the drug, due to decreased liver enzyme activity.  For renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease),  dosage adjustments aren't specified, but renal elimination of SN-38 is minimal.

**Important:**  The medication should be withheld if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below 1500/mm³ on day 1 or below 1000/mm³ on day 8 of a cycle.  Dose reductions or discontinuation are necessary depending on the severity and duration of hematological or non-hematological toxicities, according to specific guidelines outlined in the prescribing information.


### Side Effects

Sacituzumab govitecan can cause a range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity. Common side effects (>10% of patients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
*   Anemia
*   Hair loss (alopecia)
*   Headache
*   Decreased appetite
*   Constipation
*   Increased liver enzyme levels


Less common but serious side effects include:

*   Severe neutropenia (potentially life-threatening)
*   Severe diarrhea
*   Infusion-related reactions (allergic-type reactions)
*   Hypersensitivity reactions
*   Febrile neutropenia (fever with low white blood cell count)
*   Acute kidney injury
*   Venous thromboembolism (blood clots)
*   Pneumonia
*   Intestinal obstruction


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate.  It works by targeting a protein called Trop-2, which is found on the surface of many cancer cells. The antibody portion of the drug binds to Trop-2, delivering a chemotherapy drug (SN-38, a topoisomerase I inhibitor) directly to the cancer cells.  SN-38 then damages the cancer cell's DNA, leading to cell death (apoptosis). This targeted delivery helps to minimize damage to healthy cells.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindication:**  Sacituzumab govitecan is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to the drug.
*   **Hypersensitivity:** Patients should be carefully monitored for hypersensitivity reactions during and after infusion.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sacituzumab govitecan is known to cause birth defects. Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least six months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one month after the last dose.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use of UGT1A1 inhibitors (drugs that slow down the breakdown of SN-38) can increase the risk of side effects. UGT1A1 inducers (drugs that increase SN-38 breakdown) can reduce the effectiveness of the medication.  Avoid using these drugs concurrently.
*   **Reduced UGT1A1 Activity:** Patients with reduced UGT1A1 activity may experience increased exposure to SN-38, increasing their risk of side effects. Close monitoring is essential.
*   **Hematological Monitoring:**  Regular blood counts are necessary to monitor for neutropenia and other blood abnormalities.
*   **Premedication:**  Premedication with antipyretics and antihistamines is typically recommended before each infusion to reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long will I be on Sacituzumab govitecan?** A:  Treatment duration depends on your response to the medication and the presence of any intolerable side effects.  Your doctor will monitor your progress closely.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to discuss rescheduling or making adjustments to your treatment plan.

*   **Q: How is Sacituzumab govitecan stored?** A: Protect the drug from light. Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.

*   **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A:  There are no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet can help manage side effects.  Discuss any dietary concerns with your doctor or a registered dietitian.

*   **Q: Can I drive while taking Sacituzumab govitecan?** A:  Fatigue is a common side effect; if you experience this, avoid driving or operating machinery.

*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Sacituzumab govitecan?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while undergoing cancer treatment unless specifically advised otherwise by your doctor.  Alcohol can interact with some medications and potentially worsen side effects.
