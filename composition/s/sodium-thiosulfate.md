# Sodium Thiosulfate
### Generic Name
Sodium Thiosulfate

### Usage
Sodium thiosulfate's primary use is as part of a life-saving antidote for acute cyanide poisoning.  It's administered sequentially with sodium nitrite.  It's also used in managing extravasation (leakage from a blood vessel) caused by certain chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin, mechlorethamine, and bendamustine.  In these cases, it helps mitigate tissue damage caused by the leaked drug.

### Dosage

**Cyanide Poisoning:**

* **Adults:** 12.5 g (50 mL of a 25% solution) intravenously (IV). This is given *after* sodium nitrite administration.  A repeat dose of half the initial amount may be given if cyanide toxicity symptoms recur.
* **Pediatric (Infants, Children, Adolescents):** 7 g/m² or 250 mg/kg (1 mL/kg or 28-40 mL/m²) IV, given after sodium nitrite. The maximum dose is 12.5 g (50 mL of a 25% solution), with a possible repeat half-dose if symptoms return.


**Extravasation Management:**

Dosage varies depending on the drug extravasated and the site of extravasation.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by your medical provider.  Generally:

* **Cisplatin:** For every 100 mg of cisplatin extravasated, 2 mL of a 1/6 (~4%) molar solution is given IV. Subcutaneous (SubQ) administration around the extravasated area may also be considered (0.1-1 mL, multiple times in the first 3-4 hours).
* **Mechlorethamine and Bendamustine:** For every 1 mg of mechlorethamine or bendamustine extravasated, 2 mL of a 1/6 (~4%) molar solution is administered SubQ into the extravasated site.

**Important Note:**  Dosage and administration for cyanide poisoning and extravasation management must be guided by a medical professional.  Self-administration is extremely dangerous.


### Side Effects

* Hypotension (low blood pressure), especially dependent on infusion rate
* Disorientation
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Prolonged bleeding time
* Contact dermatitis (skin rash)
* Local irritation at the injection site

Serious side effects are rare but possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if any adverse reactions occur.


### How it Works

In cyanide poisoning, sodium thiosulfate acts as a sulfur donor for the enzyme rhodanese. This enzyme converts the highly toxic cyanide into thiocyanate, a much less toxic compound that can be easily excreted by the body.

In extravasation management, sodium thiosulfate's mechanism isn't fully understood in all cases but is believed to help neutralize or reduce the tissue-damaging effects of the extravasated chemotherapeutic agent.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** While no specific contraindications are listed by manufacturers, extreme caution is warranted.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Use with caution in patients with a known sulfite sensitivity.
* **Hypertension:** Use cautiously in hypertensive patients, due to the potential for hypotension as a side effect.
* **Renal Impairment:** Sodium thiosulfate is primarily eliminated via the kidneys.  Therefore, those with impaired kidney function are at increased risk of adverse effects. Dosage adjustment may be necessary, though manufacturer labeling doesn't specify this.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is specified in manufacturer's labeling.
* **Other Medications:** The safety of co-administering sodium thiosulfate with other cyanide antidotes (besides sodium nitrite) hasn’t been fully established. 
* **Edematous Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with conditions leading to fluid retention (e.g., cirrhosis, heart failure, renal impairment, pregnancy-related toxemia).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sodium thiosulfate falls under pregnancy category C.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring caution during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Sodium Thiosulfate stored?**  A: Follow the storage guidelines provided on the product label. Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Can I take Sodium Thiosulfate without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Sodium thiosulfate should only be administered under strict medical supervision due to its use in life-threatening situations and the potential for serious side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention.
* **Q:  Is sodium thiosulfate available in different forms?** A:  It's commonly available as a 25% solution for IV injection. Other concentrations may exist depending on regional availability and intended use.  A 1/6 molar solution is used for extravasation.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effect depends on the context of its use. In cyanide poisoning, it works rapidly in conjunction with sodium nitrite. The effects in extravasation management are more gradual, reducing tissue damage over time.
