# Sodium Sulfate + Potassium Sulfate + Magnesium Sulfate + Polyethylene Glycol
### Generic Name
Sodium Sulfate + Potassium Sulfate + Magnesium Sulfate + Polyethylene Glycol

### Usage

This combination of salts and polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a bowel cleansing solution used primarily to prepare the bowel for a colonoscopy in adults.  It works by drawing water into the intestines, producing a laxative effect that clears the bowel of stool. This ensures a clear view of the colon during the procedure, allowing for better visualization and diagnosis.  This is its primary and almost exclusive use.


### Dosage

The dosage is administered as a two-part regimen, either split over two days or as a one-day preparation.  Dosage specifics vary based on the chosen regimen:


**Split-Dose (2-Day) Regimen:**

* **Dose 1 (Evening before colonoscopy):**  A 6-ounce oral solution (containing Sodium sulfate 17.5 g, Potassium sulfate 3.13 g, Magnesium sulfate 1.6 g) is diluted to 16 ounces (480 mL) of water and consumed within 20 minutes.  This is followed by two additional 16-ounce refills of water consumed over the next few hours before bedtime.  Total fluid intake for Dose 1 is approximately 48 ounces (1440 mL).

* **Dose 2 (Morning of colonoscopy):** A 2-liter (2000 mL) solution of reconstituted powder (containing PEG 3350 210 g, sodium bicarbonate 2.86 g, sodium chloride 5.6 g, potassium chloride 0.74 g) is consumed, generally 480 mL every 20 minutes until the solution is finished (this should be completed at least 2 hours prior to the colonoscopy).

**Day-Before (1-Day) Regimen:**

This alternative method involves the same components but with different timing and fluid intake volumes. The total fluid intake is adjusted to roughly 83 ounces (2480 mL). The specific timings and fluid volumes for each of the two doses are provided by the manufacturer and should be strictly followed.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of this combination in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):

* Malaise
* Abdominal distension
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Increased serum bilirubin level (liver related)
* Renal insufficiency (kidney related)


Less common but potentially serious side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients):

* Headache
* Acidosis (high acidity in the blood)
* Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia)
* Increased serum creatinine levels (kidney related)
* Other metabolic abnormalities


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

This combination of salts and PEG functions as an osmotic laxative. The sulfate salts (sodium, potassium, and magnesium sulfates) are poorly absorbed in the intestines.  They draw water into the intestinal tract by osmosis, increasing stool volume and softening it, which stimulates bowel movements.  PEG further contributes to this osmotic effect by its unabsorbed nature, also leading to increased water retention in the bowel. The combined action of these compounds leads to the evacuation of the bowel.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This bowel preparation should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to any of its components, bowel obstruction, ileus, bowel perforation, gastric retention, toxic colitis, or toxic megacolon.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several drug interactions exist, notably with certain medications impacting renal, cardiac, and electrolyte function.  Patients should disclose all medications and supplements they are currently taking to their doctor.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; close monitoring is required.
* **Cardiac Issues:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac issues.  Electrolyte imbalances can worsen existing heart problems.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Pre-existing electrolyte imbalances should be addressed before using this bowel preparation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  More information is needed regarding excretion in breast milk.
* **Elderly Patients:**  May be more susceptible to side effects; closer monitoring is advised.
