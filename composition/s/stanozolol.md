# Stanozolol
### Generic Name
Stanozolol

### Usage
Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid primarily used to treat hereditary angioedema (HAE).  It's also been used in the past for certain types of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, though this is less common now.  Other historical uses include treating certain catabolic disorders (conditions where the body breaks down tissue faster than it builds it) and osteopetrosis (a rare bone disease).  Note that stanozolol tablets have been withdrawn from the U.S. market.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and overall health.  Always follow your doctor's prescription exactly.  There's no standard "one-size-fits-all" approach.

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hereditary Angioedema (oral):**  Initial doses typically range from 2.5 to 10 mg per day, often adjusted downwards based on response. Maintenance doses might be as low as 2 mg daily, every other day, or 2.5 mg three times weekly.

* **Other Conditions (intramuscular):** For conditions like anemia, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and certain other uses, a typical dose is 50 mg every 2-3 weeks given as an intramuscular injection.  The precise dosage will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs.

* **Vascular manifestations of Behcet syndrome (oral):** A typical dose is 10 mg/day.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Hereditary Angioedema (oral):**  Children under 6 years old may receive 1 mg/day; 6-12 year-olds may receive up to 2 mg/day.  Pediatric dosages require careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Stanozolol is generally not recommended for people with severe liver problems.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically made for people with kidney problems, but close monitoring is essential.

### Side Effects

Stanozolol can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare but serious.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

* **Common:**  The frequency of these side effects isn't well-defined in available literature.
* **Serious (less common, but potentially life-threatening):** Peliosis hepatis (blood-filled cysts in the liver), premature epiphyseal closure (in children), cholestatic jaundice (liver disorder), virilism (masculinizing effects in women), impotence, priapism (prolonged painful erection), testicular atrophy, gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men), prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate), decreased libido, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), menstrual irregularities, edema (swelling), acne, hepatic necrosis (liver cell death), and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).

### How it Works

Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid similar in structure to testosterone. It works by increasing collagen production (a protein crucial for tissue repair) and reducing the anti-anabolic effects of cortisone (a hormone that can break down tissue). It is also believed to reduce fibrin deposition (blood clot formation) and impact the production of kinins, substances that may contribute to swelling in HAE.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Stanozolol is contraindicated (should not be used) in pregnancy, lactation, prostate or breast cancer in men, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), hypercalciuria (high calcium in urine), porphyria (a group of genetic disorders), severe hepatic impairment, known or suspected prostate carcinoma, and nephrosis or the nephrotic phase of nephritis (kidney disease).
* **Use with Caution:** Stanozolol should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease; epilepsy; diabetes mellitus; children; and elderly patients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Stanozolol can interact with several medications, including insulin, sulfonylureas, levothyroxine, and anticoagulants (like warfarin). It might also interfere with neuromuscular blockers. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
