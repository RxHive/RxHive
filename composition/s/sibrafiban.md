# Sibrafiban
### Generic Name
Sibrafiban

### Usage
Sibrafiban was a drug under development intended for the secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis.  This means it was being investigated to help prevent further blood clots in arteries after events like unstable angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart) or acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).  However, it did not progress past clinical trials due to a lack of demonstrated superiority over existing treatments like aspirin.

### Dosage
Because Sibrafiban did not complete clinical trials and was never approved for market use, specific dosage recommendations for adults or children are unavailable.  Information on different forms (e.g., tablet, syrup, injection) and administration guidelines is also not available for public use.

### Side Effects
Since Sibrafiban's development was halted before market approval, a complete profile of side effects is not publicly available.  Information from pre-clinical and early phase clinical trials would likely be limited and not suitable for general use.

### How it Works
Sibrafiban was a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form (Ro 44-3888) within the body.  The active compound is a peptidomimetic, meaning it mimics a peptide, and specifically targets the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets.  By blocking this receptor, Sibrafiban was intended to inhibit platelet aggregation (the clumping together of platelets), thereby reducing the risk of blood clot formation.

### Precautions
Given that Sibrafiban never reached market approval, comprehensive precaution information is not available.  Potential precautions would typically include contraindications (situations where the drug should not be used), interactions with other medications, and warnings for specific patient populations (such as pregnant women, children, or the elderly). Without completed clinical trials, this crucial safety data remains unknown.

### FAQs
* **Q: Is Sibrafiban still available?**  A: No, Sibrafiban's development was terminated due to the lack of efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials.  It is not available for prescription or purchase.
* **Q: What are the alternatives to Sibrafiban?** A:  Aspirin and other antiplatelet medications are commonly used for the secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis.  Your healthcare provider can advise on suitable alternative treatments.
* **Q: Where can I find more information on Sibrafiban?** A: Because Sibrafiban didn't progress beyond clinical trials, detailed public information is limited.  Information from clinical trial results may be available through scientific databases, but interpretation of this data requires specialist medical knowledge.  Consult a healthcare professional for any concerns regarding similar medications or alternative treatments.
