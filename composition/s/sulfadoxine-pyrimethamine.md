# Sulfadoxine + Pyrimethamine
### Generic Name
Sulfadoxine + Pyrimethamine

### Usage

Sulfadoxine and Pyrimethamine is a combination antimalarial drug used primarily to treat uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria, particularly in regions where chloroquine resistance is prevalent.  It's also used for short-term malaria prophylaxis (prevention) in certain situations.  However, it's crucial to understand that the World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend its routine use for malaria prophylaxis, only considering it when alternative treatments are unavailable or contraindicated in areas with known sensitivity to the drug.  The treatment of uncomplicated malaria usually involves this drug in combination with other antimalarials like artesunate, not as a monotherapy.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Malaria prophylaxis:**  The dosage varies depending on immunity status and frequency of administration.  Typically, this involves 2-3 tablets (each containing Sulfadoxine 500mg and Pyrimethamine 25mg) once every 4 weeks for semi-immune individuals, or 2 tablets every 2 weeks or 1 tablet weekly for non-immune individuals.  Prophylaxis should start 1-2 weeks before entering a malaria-endemic area, continue throughout the stay, and for 4 weeks after leaving.

* **Malaria treatment (uncomplicated):**  This is generally off-label usage.  A single dose of 3 tablets (1500mg Sulfadoxine and 75mg Pyrimethamine) is given in conjunction with a 3-day course of oral artesunate.  *Monotherapy is not recommended*.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for children is weight-based and differs for prophylaxis and treatment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for precise pediatric dosing as it varies considerably with age and weight. For both prophylaxis and treatment, the drug is generally not recommended for infants under 2 months old.

* **Malaria prophylaxis:** The dose is considerably lower than the adult dose and is adjusted according to age and immunity status (semi-immune vs non-immune).  

* **Malaria treatment (uncomplicated):**  Similar to adults, this is usually off-label and necessitates a combination therapy (generally with artesunate) with precise weight-based dosing that needs to be determined by a doctor.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with impaired liver or kidney function and its use is contraindicated for malaria prophylaxis in such cases. Severe impairment prohibits use.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Fatigue

Less common but serious side effects:

* Stevens-Johnson syndrome

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Liver damage
* Kidney damage
* Blood disorders


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Sulfadoxine and Pyrimethamine act synergistically to inhibit the growth of the malaria parasite.  Sulfadoxine blocks the production of folic acid, a vital nutrient for the parasite, by competitively inhibiting an enzyme involved in folic acid synthesis. Pyrimethamine further interferes with folic acid metabolism by inhibiting another enzyme involved in its conversion to its active form.  This combined effect significantly impairs the parasite's ability to replicate and survive, resulting in the treatment or prevention of malaria.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, other sulfonamides, or any formulation component; severe hepatic or renal impairment; megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency;  prophylactic use in late pregnancy and lactation; infants under 2 months old; prophylactic use in patients with renal or hepatic failure or blood dyscrasias.

* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of blood dyscrasias, severe dermatologic reactions, folic acid deficiency, photosensitivity, and sulfonamide allergy.  Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Avoid alcohol consumption.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Use is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. If used during pregnancy, folate supplementation is strongly recommended.  The drug is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended.  Monitor breastfed infants for hemolysis and jaundice.

* **Drug Interactions:**  The risk of adverse effects is increased when Sulfadoxine is used concurrently with certain medications (including various antipsychotics).
