# Sapropterin
### Generic Name
Sapropterin

### Usage
Sapropterin is a medication used to reduce high levels of phenylalanine in the blood of adults and children (one month old and older) with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA).  Specifically, it's used in individuals with HPA caused by phenylketonuria (PKU) that responds to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).  It's crucial to understand that sapropterin works *in conjunction* with a phenylalanine-restricted diet; it's not a standalone treatment.  The primary goal is to help manage phenylalanine levels, preventing the long-term neurological consequences associated with untreated PKU.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Existing dietary protein and phenylalanine intake should remain unchanged during the initial evaluation period. Dosage adjustments are made based on blood phenylalanine levels after a month of treatment.

**Oral Administration (Tablets or Powder for Oral Solution):**

* **Infants and Children ≤ 6 years:** The initial dose is typically 10 mg/kg/day. Phenylalanine levels are checked one week after starting and periodically throughout the first month.  The dose may be increased to 20 mg/kg/day if levels don't decrease from baseline after one month at 10 mg/kg/day. If there's still no response after another month at 20 mg/kg/day, sapropterin is discontinued.  The usual maintenance range is 5-20 mg/kg/day, tailored to individual response.

* **Children ≥ 7 years and Adolescents:** The initial dose is 10-20 mg/kg/day.  Similar to younger children, phenylalanine levels are monitored closely, and the dose is adjusted after one month based on response.  Treatment is stopped if there's no response after one month at 20 mg/kg/day.  The usual maintenance range is also 5-20 mg/kg/day, individualized to the patient.

* **Adults:** The initial dose is 10-20 mg/kg/day.  The dose is adjusted after one month based on phenylalanine levels. Treatment is discontinued if levels don't decrease after one month at 20 mg/kg/day.  The maintenance range is 5-20 mg/kg/day, individualized to patient response.

**Administration Guidelines:** Tablets should be taken with food, ideally at the same time each day.  They can be swallowed whole, dissolved in water or apple juice, or crushed and mixed with soft food.  Powder for oral solution should also be taken with food and dissolved in water or apple juice before consumption.

**Dosage Adjustments for Renal or Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Headache
* Runny nose (Rhinorrhea)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Pharyngolaryngeal pain
* Cough
* Nasal congestion

**Rare or Less Frequent Side Effects (<1%):**  Abdominal pain, anaphylaxis, dyspepsia, esophageal pain, esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal inflammation, hyperactive behavior, hypersensitivity reaction, nausea, oropharyngeal pain, pharyngitis, and skin rash have been reported.

**Important:**  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Sapropterin is a synthetic version of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor crucial for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).  PAH converts phenylalanine (an amino acid) into tyrosine. In individuals with PKU, PAH activity is deficient. Sapropterin helps activate the remaining PAH enzyme, improving the body's ability to process phenylalanine and thereby lowering blood phenylalanine levels.  It's important to note that only a subset of individuals with PKU respond to sapropterin.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Sapropterin is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to sapropterin or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and rash.
* Upper gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation may occur.
* Hypophenylalaninemia (low phenylalanine levels) is a potential risk, requiring monitoring.
* Increased hyperactivity has been reported.
* Close monitoring is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While sapropterin can be considered in pregnancy in conjunction with a phenylalanine restricted diet, it should be used cautiously and under close medical supervision due to limited data.  The ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) recommends pre-pregnancy counseling, testing for response to sapropterin prior to conception, normalization of phenylalanine levels 3 months before conception and close monitoring of phenylalanine levels throughout pregnancy.


**Drug Interactions:**  Sapropterin may interact with several medications, including levodopa, primidone, valproate, methotrexate, phenobarbital, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, pralatrexate, and trimethoprim.  These interactions can either reduce the effectiveness of sapropterin or increase the risk of side effects.  Concurrent use requires careful monitoring.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from sapropterin?** A:  Blood phenylalanine levels are usually checked one week after starting treatment and periodically throughout the first month to assess response.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking sapropterin if I feel better?** A: No, do not stop taking sapropterin without consulting your doctor.  Consistent treatment and monitoring are essential to manage phenylalanine levels effectively.

* **Q: How should I store sapropterin?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  This typically involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q:  Is sapropterin right for everyone with PKU?** A: No, sapropterin is only effective for a subset of individuals with BH4-responsive PKU.  Your doctor will determine if it's appropriate for you based on testing and your individual needs.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose of sapropterin?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but avoid taking two doses on the same day.  Contact your physician if you have questions or concerns about missed doses.
