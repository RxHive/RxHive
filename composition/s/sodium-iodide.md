# Sodium Iodide
### Generic Name
Sodium Iodide

### Usage
Sodium iodide is primarily used as an iodine supplement, particularly in situations where adequate iodine intake through diet is insufficient or impossible.  Its main application is in parenteral nutrition (PN), intravenous solutions given to individuals who cannot receive sufficient nutrition orally.  Adding sodium iodide to PN prevents iodine deficiency, which can lead to various health problems, including hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).  While not a primary use, it's also sometimes used in other clinical settings to address iodine deficiency.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of iodine varies by age and physiological state (pregnancy, lactation).  The dosages below are guidelines for supplemental iodine via intravenous administration within parenteral nutrition solutions, and should *always* be determined and overseen by a physician.  Self-administration is dangerous.

**Adults:**

* Usual range: 1-2 mcg/kg/day (typically 75-150 mcg/day).
* Pregnant or breastfeeding women: 2-3 mcg/kg/day.

**Children and Adolescents:**  Dosage is determined based on individual needs and weight, always under the direction of a physician.  The RDA for iodine varies considerably with age and development.

**Administration:** Sodium iodide is administered intravenously, always as part of a larger parenteral nutrition admixture, never undiluted into a peripheral vein (to avoid phlebitis).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common (frequency not specified in available data):**  Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell), hemorrhage (bleeding), and lymph node hyperplasia (enlarged lymph nodes).
* **Less Common but Serious:** Anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction), angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), hypersensitivity reactions, arthralgia (joint pain), and fever.

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects after receiving sodium iodide, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Iodine is an essential component in the production of thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine).  These hormones regulate metabolism, growth, and development.  Sodium iodide provides the body with iodine, preventing or correcting iodine deficiency and ensuring proper thyroid hormone synthesis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Known hypersensitivity (allergy) to iodine or any component of the formulation. Undiluted intravenous administration into a peripheral vein is contraindicated.
* **Increased Risk:** Hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially life-threatening anaphylactic shock.
* **Use with Caution:** In patients with renal impairment, neonates, patients with thyroid disease, and patients with tuberculosis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with levothyroxine, liothyronine, liotrix, thyroid desiccated, methimazole, potassium iodide, or propylthiouracil may alter the effects of sodium iodide.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Sodium iodide may be used during pregnancy and lactation as an iodine supplement within parenteral nutrition under medical supervision.  Iodine is excreted in breast milk.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take sodium iodide orally?** A: No, the intravenous form is used specifically within parenteral nutrition solutions. Oral iodine supplementation is available but should be prescribed by a doctor.

* **Q: How is sodium iodide stored?** A:  Storage instructions should be followed exactly as per the specific product label.  Generally, it requires refrigeration.

* **Q: Is sodium iodide safe for everyone?** A: While generally safe when administered correctly and under medical supervision, it can cause adverse effects in some individuals, particularly those with allergies to iodine or underlying health conditions.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Since sodium iodide is administered within a parenteral nutrition regimen, it's crucial to follow the prescribed schedule exactly.  Contact your doctor or healthcare team if you miss a dose or have any questions.

* **Q: How long will I need to take sodium iodide?** A: The duration of treatment depends entirely on the individual's condition and response to therapy.  Your physician will determine the appropriate duration.
