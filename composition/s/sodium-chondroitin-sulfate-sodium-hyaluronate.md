# Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate + Sodium Hyaluronate
### Generic Name
Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate + Sodium Hyaluronate

### Usage
This combination of Sodium chondroitin sulfate and Sodium hyaluronate is used as an ophthalmic (eye-related) surgical aid in procedures affecting the front part of the eye (anterior segment).  Its primary use is during cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation surgeries.  It acts as a viscoelastic substance, helping to maintain the shape of the eye during these delicate procedures.

### Dosage
**Ophthalmic Surgery (as a surgical aid):**  The medication is injected directly into the anterior chamber of the eye using a 27-gauge cannula. The injection is typically administered either before or after the removal of the eye's natural lens (crystalline lens). The exact amount used depends on the specific surgical needs and is determined by the ophthalmologist.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of this combination in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
* Increased intraocular pressure (although the frequency is not defined in available literature).

While rare, any significant changes in vision or eye discomfort should be reported immediately to a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Sodium chondroitin sulfate and Sodium hyaluronate work together as a viscoelastic solution.  This means it acts like a gel, providing cushioning and support to the delicate tissues of the eye during surgery. It helps maintain the eye's shape and protects the corneal endothelial cells (cells lining the cornea) from damage caused by surgical instruments. The solution also helps create space and stabilize tissues, making the surgical procedure easier and safer.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Patients with a known allergy to either Sodium chondroitin sulfate or Sodium hyaluronate should not use this medication.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been established.  It should only be used in these situations if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Always consult with a doctor.
* **General Considerations:** Always follow the specific instructions provided with the product regarding preparation and administration during surgery.  The solution is for intraocular use only.  Do not reuse cannulas. Proper irrigation and aspiration with sterile solution are necessary at the end of the surgical procedure to remove any remaining solution.


### FAQs

**Q: What is the purpose of this medication during eye surgery?**

**A:** It acts as a protective cushion and support to the delicate eye tissues during cataract surgery and IOL implantation.  This minimizes damage and improves the precision of the procedure.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects of this medication?**

**A:**  This medication is used only during surgery; it's not a long-term treatment.  Any potential effects are typically associated with the surgical procedure itself, not the medication.
