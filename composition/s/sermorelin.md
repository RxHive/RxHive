# Sermorelin
### Generic Name
Sermorelin

### Usage
Sermorelin is a synthetic version of the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH).  Its primary use is as a diagnostic tool to evaluate how well the pituitary gland releases growth hormone (GH). This is crucial in diagnosing growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children and, less commonly, adults.  While not a standalone diagnostic test for GHD, sermorelin stimulation testing helps assess the pituitary's response to a GHRH stimulus, providing valuable information when used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods.  In children, sermorelin is also used therapeutically to treat growth hormone deficiency or growth failure, aiming to stimulate natural GH production and promote growth.

### Dosage

**Diagnostic Use (Adults and Children):**  Sermorelin is administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 1 mcg/kg body weight in the morning after an overnight fast. Blood samples are taken at specific intervals (typically before and at 15-minute intervals for up to an hour post-injection) to measure the GH response.  The results are interpreted in context with other diagnostic tests to determine the presence or absence of GHD.

**Therapeutic Use (Children Only):**  Sermorelin is given subcutaneously (under the skin) at a dose of 30 mcg/kg body weight once daily at bedtime.  The treatment duration is determined by the physician based on the child's growth response and the closure of the epiphyses (growth plates).

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in these cases.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Tightness in the chest
* Facial flushing
* Urticaria (hives)
* Pain at the injection site
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, are possible.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Sermorelin is a short peptide that mimics the natural GHRH.  When administered, it binds to receptors on the pituitary gland, stimulating the release of growth hormone (GH) into the bloodstream.  GH then acts on various tissues throughout the body, promoting growth and affecting metabolism.  In diagnostic use, the amount of GH released helps evaluate pituitary function. In therapeutic use, increased GH levels aim to improve growth in children with GHD.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Sermorelin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to sermorelin or any of its components.
* **Diabetes Mellitus:** Use caution in patients with diabetes, as GH can affect glucose metabolism.
* **Epilepsy:** Caution is advised in patients with epilepsy, as GH may potentially lower the seizure threshold.
* **Hypothyroidism:**  Uncontrolled hypothyroidism should be managed before starting sermorelin therapy.
* **Obesity:** Sermorelin should be used cautiously in obese patients.
* **Elevated Plasma Fatty Acids:** Caution is advised in patients with elevated plasma fatty acids.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Drugs that affect growth hormone release (e.g., somatostatin, insulin, glucocorticoids, cyclooxygenase inhibitors) may interact with sermorelin.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Sermorelin should be avoided during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  The safety of sermorelin during breastfeeding is unknown, and breastfeeding is generally not recommended.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does sermorelin therapy last?** A: The duration of sermorelin therapy, particularly for therapeutic use in children, varies depending on the individual's response and the physician's assessment. Treatment is typically discontinued once the epiphyses (growth plates) have closed.

* **Q: How is sermorelin stored?** A:  Specific storage instructions will be provided on the medication packaging. Generally, it should be stored at a controlled room temperature away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Are there any long-term side effects of sermorelin?** A:  Long-term studies on sermorelin are limited.  However, potential long-term effects are a concern, and regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential.

* **Q: Is sermorelin suitable for adults with growth hormone deficiency?** A: While sermorelin is used diagnostically in adults, its therapeutic use is primarily focused on children.  Other growth hormone therapies are typically used for adult GHD treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of sermorelin?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance. Do not attempt to double up on the missed dose.
