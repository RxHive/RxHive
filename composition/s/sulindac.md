Sulindac

### Usage
Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the signs and symptoms of various inflammatory conditions.  Its main uses include:

* **Osteoarthritis:**  A degenerative joint disease causing pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. Sulindac helps manage the pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** An autoimmune disease leading to chronic inflammation of the joints. Sulindac helps control joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** A form of arthritis primarily affecting the spine, causing inflammation, pain, and stiffness. Sulindac aids in managing these symptoms.
* **Acute gouty arthritis:**  Characterized by sudden, severe joint pain and inflammation due to uric acid crystal buildup. Sulindac provides relief from the acute pain and inflammation.
* **Acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis):**  Conditions causing shoulder pain and inflammation. Sulindac helps reduce pain and inflammation in these conditions.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated.  Generally, it's administered orally.  The maximum daily dose is usually 400 mg.  Specific regimens include:

* **Acute gouty arthritis:** 200 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis and Osteoarthritis/Rheumatoid arthritis:** 150 mg BID.
* **Bursitis/tendinopathy of the shoulder:** 200 mg BID for 7-14 days.

**Children and Adolescents (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis):** The dosage is determined by weight, typically 2-6 mg/kg/day divided into two doses, with a maximum of 400 mg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However, reduced dosages might be necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems, necessitating close monitoring by a healthcare professional.  Consult with a doctor before adjusting the dosage.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**  A wide range of serious side effects are possible, including but not limited to:  agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, aseptic meningitis, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), various gastrointestinal complications (bleeding, ulceration, perforation), liver damage (hepatitis, jaundice, liver failure), kidney problems (renal failure, interstitial nephritis), blood disorders (thrombocytopenia, anemia), skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), and cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).  


If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Sulindac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, Sulindac alleviates pain and inflammation.  Other mechanisms may also contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sulindac is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components, those with a history of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:** Sulindac may interact with many drugs, including aspirin, other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, diuretics, lithium, and cyclosporine.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Sulindac carries a black box warning for increased risks of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events (heart attack, stroke) and serious gastrointestinal complications (bleeding, ulceration, perforation).  Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal issues, or renal/hepatic impairment need close monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sulindac is categorized as pregnancy Category C.  Its use should be avoided in late pregnancy.  The decision to use Sulindac during breastfeeding should involve careful consideration of the benefits to the mother versus potential risks to the infant.
