# Strychnos Nux-vomica
### Generic Name
Strychnine (derived from *Strychnos nux-vomica*)

**Note:**  It's crucial to understand that Strychnine derived from *Strychnos nux-vomica* is extremely toxic and is **not** a medication used in modern medicine for therapeutic purposes.  Its use is highly restricted and only found in very specific and controlled research settings.  The information below is provided for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as an endorsement or recommendation for its use.  **Never attempt to use Strychnine without direct supervision from a qualified medical professional.**


### Usage
Historically, and extremely rarely in highly controlled settings now, extremely small doses of strychnine (derived from *Strychnos nux-vomica*) have been investigated for a few specific conditions.  These uses are largely obsolete due to the extreme toxicity and availability of safer alternatives.  There is no established clinical use of strychnine in modern medicine.


### Dosage
There is no safe or established dosage for strychnine for human therapeutic use. Any use requires the supervision of a highly qualified medical professional, and even then it is exceptionally rare.  Due to its extremely high toxicity, even minor deviations from precisely calculated dosages can lead to severe adverse effects and death.


### Side Effects
Even in extremely small doses, strychnine can cause a range of severe side effects, including:

* Muscle spasms and rigidity
* Convulsions
* Seizures
* Difficulty breathing
* Increased heart rate
* Tremors
* Anxiety
* Restlessness
* Death (at even slightly higher doses)


### How it Works
Strychnine acts primarily as a central nervous system stimulant. It works by blocking the action of inhibitory neurotransmitters, particularly glycine, in the spinal cord and brainstem. This leads to an unchecked excitation of neurons, resulting in uncontrolled muscle contractions, convulsions, and ultimately, death if the dosage is high enough.


### Precautions
**Strychnine is extremely toxic and should never be used without direct supervision from a qualified medical professional.  There are no established therapeutic uses.**  Even the smallest amounts can be fatal.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly should absolutely avoid all exposure to strychnine.  Any interaction with other medications is potentially dangerous and should be completely avoided.
