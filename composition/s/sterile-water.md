# Sterile Water

**Generic Name:** Sterile Water for Injection, Sterile Water for Irrigation

**Usage:**

* **Injection:** Sterile water for injection (SWFI) is used as a solvent or diluent to reconstitute or dilute medications before administration.  It is *never* administered alone intravenously.
* **Irrigation:** Sterile water for irrigation is used to cleanse wounds, irrigate body cavities during surgery, and flush medical devices.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are primarily related to the medication being dissolved or diluted in the sterile water, not the water itself.  However, if administered intravenously *alone*, SWFI can cause hemolysis (rupture of red blood cells), resulting in serious complications, including:

* Hemolytic anemia
* Acute renal failure (kidney failure)
* Circulatory collapse
* Death


**How it Works:**

Sterile water for injection acts solely as a vehicle. It does not have any pharmacological activity of its own. It provides a sterile medium for dissolving and administering medications or for cleansing wounds/tissues. The mechanism of action is purely physical â€“ it facilitates the delivery of other substances.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use sterile water for injection to flush my contact lenses?** A: No.  While sterile, it's not formulated for contact lens use and may lack necessary buffers or tonicity.  Use a sterile saline solution specifically designed for contact lenses.

* **Q: Can I drink sterile water for injection?** A: No. While sterile, it lacks electrolytes and is not intended for oral consumption. Drinking it could lead to electrolyte imbalances.

* **Q: Is sterile water for injection the same as purified water?** A: No. Sterile water for injection undergoes additional processes to ensure it's free from microorganisms, pyrogens (fever-inducing substances), and other contaminants. Purified water is not necessarily sterile.

* **Q:  Can I reuse sterile water once the container is opened?** A: No. Once the seal is broken, the sterility is compromised.  Discard any remaining solution.

* **Q:  What should I do if I accidentally inject sterile water intravenously?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention. This is a medical emergency.
