# Selegiline

**Generic Name:** Selegiline

**Usage:**

Selegiline is primarily used to treat Parkinson's disease and depression.  Specifically:

* **Parkinson's Disease:**  It's often used in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, sometimes alone but more frequently in combination with levodopa. It helps to improve motor function and reduce symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and slow movement.  It's also used to delay the need for higher doses of levodopa.

* **Depression:**  Selegiline is used as an adjunctive therapy (meaning it's used alongside other antidepressants) for depression, particularly in patients who haven't responded well to other treatments.  Its use for depression is less common than for Parkinson's.

**Important Note:** The dosage and administration method (oral or transdermal patch) will vary greatly depending on the condition being treated and the individual patient.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.


**Side Effects:**

Selegiline can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less so. These can include:

* **Common:** Insomnia, dizziness, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, headache, orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up), anxiety, vivid dreams, agitation.

* **Less Common but More Serious:** Hallucinations, confusion, difficulty urinating, liver problems (rare but serious), serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention), severe hypertension (high blood pressure) â€“ especially when combined with certain foods containing tyramine (see FAQs).

* **Drug Interactions:** Selegiline can interact with many other medications, including other antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, and certain pain relievers. Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.


**How it Works:**

Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).  Specifically, it's a selective MAO-B inhibitor.  MAO-B is an enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain. By inhibiting MAO-B, selegiline increases the levels of dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter crucial for motor control and mood regulation.  This increase in dopamine helps alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may improve mood in depression.  The mechanism by which it improves depression is still not fully understood but is likely multifactorial and related to the increased dopamine levels and other neurotransmitter effects.


**FAQs:**

* **What is the "tyramine effect"?** Selegiline, especially when taken in higher doses, can interact with tyramine-rich foods (aged cheeses, cured meats, fermented foods, some beers and wines).  Tyramine can cause a dangerous surge in blood pressure (hypertensive crisis).  Patients on selegiline often need to follow a low-tyramine diet.  This dietary restriction is particularly important for the older, more potent forms of MAOI but is still recommended for selegiline.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking selegiline?**  Alcohol can interact with selegiline and increase the risk of side effects. It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly while on this medication. Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Is selegiline addictive?** Selegiline is not considered an addictive drug.

* **Can I stop taking selegiline suddenly?** No, you should never stop taking selegiline suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce your dose if needed.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed as serious above.
