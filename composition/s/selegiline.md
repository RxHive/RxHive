# Selegiline
### Generic Name
Selegiline

### Usage
Selegiline is primarily used as an adjunct therapy in the management of Parkinson's disease.  It's not a standalone treatment but rather works best in combination with levodopa/carbidopa.  Specifically, Selegiline is prescribed for patients with Parkinson's disease whose response to levodopa/carbidopa has started to deteriorate, meaning the medication is becoming less effective at managing their symptoms.  This helps improve the quality of response to levodopa/carbidopa, extending its beneficial effects.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the formulation (tablet, capsule, or orally disintegrating tablet) and the patient's response.

* **Oral tablets/capsules (for Parkinson's disease):** The usual starting dose is 5 mg twice daily, taken with breakfast and lunch, *along with* levodopa/carbidopa. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg.  After 2-3 days of starting Selegiline, the levodopa/carbidopa dose may be gradually reduced by 10-30%, as tolerated by the patient.

* **Oral orally disintegrating tablets (for Parkinson's disease):** The starting dose is typically lower, beginning at 1.25 mg once daily along with levodopa/carbidopa for at least 6 weeks.  This may be increased to 2.5 mg once daily after 6 weeks if tolerated and the response is adequate. The maximum daily dose is 2.5 mg. It's important to avoid food or liquids for 5 minutes before and after taking this formulation.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Selegiline in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment, and further research is needed.  Caution is advised when using Selegiline in patients with liver problems. For orally disintegrating tablets, mild to moderate impairment may allow for a dose of 1.25 mg once daily based on clinical response, while severe impairment makes its use not recommended.

* **Renal Impairment:**  Similar to hepatic impairment, the manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment for oral tablets and capsules. For orally disintegrating tablets,  a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30-89 mL/min requires no adjustment, but its use is not recommended for a CrCl <30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease. Use with caution is recommended in patients with kidney problems.

### How it Works

Selegiline is a type of medication called a selective and irreversible monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor.  MAO-B is an enzyme that breaks down dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement and coordination. By inhibiting MAO-B, Selegiline prevents the breakdown of dopamine, leading to increased levels of dopamine in the brain.  This helps improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and slow movement. While the primary mechanism is dopamine preservation, there's evidence suggesting Selegiline might enhance dopaminergic activity through other pathways as well.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Selegiline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Selegiline or any of its components, those using meperidine (Demerol), tramadol, methadone, propoxyphene, other MAO inhibitors (selective or non-selective), St. John's Wort, cyclobenzaprine, and dextromethorphan.

* **Interactions:**  Selegiline can interact with several other medications.  It may increase the risk of hypertensive reactions with dopamine, increase bioavailability with oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, cause severe serotonin syndrome with antidepressants or serotonin agonists, and cause respiratory depression and hypotension with pethidine and other opioids. Avoid concomitant use.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Selegiline may increase the risk of hypertension, serotonin syndrome, falling asleep during daily activities, hypotension/orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesia, hallucinations/psychotic-like behavior, impulse control/compulsive behaviors, withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion, melanoma, irritation of the buccal mucosa, hypertensive crisis, and elevation of BUN and creatinine levels.

* **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in patients with phenylketonuria, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, those at risk of orthostatic hypotension, and those with bipolar disorder. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using Selegiline.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I eat whatever I want while taking Selegiline?** A: No.  You should avoid foods high in tyramine (aged cheeses, fermented meats, etc.) as this can lead to dangerously high blood pressure. Your doctor can provide a more detailed list.

* **Q: How should I store Selegiline?** A: Store Selegiline as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Selegiline suddenly?** A: No.  If you need to discontinue treatment, your doctor will likely recommend a gradual tapering of the dose to minimize potential withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Never take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
