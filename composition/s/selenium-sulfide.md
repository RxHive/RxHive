# Selenium Sulfide
### Generic Name
Selenium Sulfide

### Usage
Selenium sulfide is a topical antifungal medication primarily used to treat two common skin conditions: seborrheic dermatitis and tinea versicolor.

*   **Seborrheic dermatitis:** This condition causes inflammation and scaling of the skin, often affecting the scalp (causing dandruff), face, and other areas. Selenium sulfide helps control the yeast and fungi that can contribute to seborrheic dermatitis, reducing inflammation and scaling.

*   **Tinea versicolor:** Also known as pityriasis versicolor, this fungal infection leads to discolored patches on the skin. Selenium sulfide's antifungal properties directly target the fungus responsible for tinea versicolor, helping to clear the discoloration.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the formulation (shampoo, lotion) used.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully.  Information below is for general guidance only and shouldn't replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

*   **Seborrheic dermatitis (scalp):** For shampoos (2.25% or 2.3%), apply 5-10 mL to wet hair, leave on for 2-3 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.  Repeat, and rinse again. Typically, this is done twice weekly for two weeks, then 1-4 times monthly as needed. For 1% shampoos, massage into wet scalp and rinse thoroughly, at least twice weekly.

*   **Tinea versicolor:** For lotions or shampoos (2.25% or 2.3%), apply to affected areas, lather with a small amount of water, leave on for 10 minutes, and rinse thoroughly. Repeat once daily for seven days.


**Children and Adolescents:**  The dosage for children and adolescents is generally the same as for adults, however, always consult a pediatrician before using selenium sulfide on children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dose adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always inform your doctor of any existing health conditions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and transient:

*   Burning, itching, irritation, or stinging at the application site
*   Dryness or oiliness of the scalp
*   Hair discoloration or alopecia (hair loss)


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:

*   Lethargy (lack of energy)
*   Tremor
*   Vomiting (following long-term use on damaged skin)
*   Abdominal pain
*   Garlic breath
*   Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Selenium sulfide's exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to have a cytostatic effect. This means it inhibits the growth and reproduction of cells in the epidermis (outer layer of skin) and follicular epithelium (cells lining hair follicles).  By slowing down the production of skin cells, it helps reduce scaling and inflammation in seborrheic dermatitis and clears the fungal infection in tinea versicolor.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Selenium sulfide is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to selenium sulfide or any components of the formulation.

*   **Interactions:**  There is limited information regarding drug interactions with selenium sulfide.  However, it's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you're using.

*   **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Selenium sulfide is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus haven't been fully established.  Use during pregnancy is only advisable if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Excretion in breast milk following topical application is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.

*   **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and broken skin.  Thoroughly rinse hair after application, especially if color-treated or permed. Remove jewelry before application. Discontinue use if an allergic reaction occurs.  Do not use on inflamed or weeping skin.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: Improvement typically occurs within a few weeks of regular use, but the timeframe varies depending on the severity of the condition and individual response.

*   **Q: Can I use selenium sulfide every day?** A:  This depends on the condition and the product strength.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully. Overuse can potentially lead to skin irritation.

*   **Q: How should I store selenium sulfide?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

*   **Q: Is selenium sulfide safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use should be guided by a healthcare professional.  Extended use may increase the risk of certain side effects.

*   **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get selenium sulfide in my eyes?** A: Flush your eyes immediately with plenty of cool water and seek medical attention if irritation persists.
