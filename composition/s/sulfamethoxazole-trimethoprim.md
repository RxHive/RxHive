# Sulfamethoxazole + Trimethoprim

**Generic Name:** Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (often abbreviated as SMX/TMP)

**Usage:**  Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim is a combination antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** This is one of its most common uses.
* **Ear infections (otitis media):** Particularly in children.
* **Bronchitis:**  Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
* **Pneumonia:** Certain types of pneumonia, especially those caused by *Pneumocystis jirovecii* (PCP) in immunocompromised individuals (like those with HIV/AIDS).
* **Traveler's diarrhea:** Caused by some bacteria.
* **Skin infections:** Such as cellulitis and impetigo.
* **Wounds and burns:**  To prevent or treat infections.

**Important Note:**  Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim is **not effective against viral infections** such as the common cold or influenza.  It's crucial to use antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor to avoid antibiotic resistance.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:** A frequent complaint.
* **Vomiting:**  May occur, especially with higher doses.
* **Diarrhea:** Can be mild or severe.
* **Abdominal pain:**  A common gastrointestinal complaint.
* **Rash:**  A potential allergic reaction.  Severe allergic reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis) are rare but serious.
* **Headache:** A relatively common side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Less common but can occur.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Changes in blood counts:**  This is rare but requires monitoring in some cases.


**How it Works:** Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim work together to inhibit bacterial growth.  They act at different points in the folic acid synthesis pathway, a crucial process for bacterial reproduction.  Sulfamethoxazole blocks the production of dihydrofolic acid, while trimethoprim blocks the conversion of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid.  By blocking this pathway at two different points, the combination is highly effective against susceptible bacteria.
