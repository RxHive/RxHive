# Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide
### Generic Name
Sucroferric Oxyhydroxide

### Usage
Sucroferric oxyhydroxide is primarily used to control high levels of phosphorus in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are undergoing dialysis.  This medication works by binding to phosphorus in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption and promoting its elimination through the stool.  It's crucial to understand that this drug doesn't cure CKD or its complications but helps manage a specific symptom.

### Dosage
**Adults (with CKD on dialysis):**  Sucroferric oxyhydroxide tablets come in 2.5g tablets (equivalent to 500 mg of iron). The starting dose is typically one tablet three times daily (TID) with meals.  The dosage is adjusted weekly, based on blood phosphorus levels, aiming for levels at or below 5.5 mg/dL.  Adjustments are made in increments or decrements of 500 mg of iron per day. The usual maintenance dose ranges from 3 to 4 tablets daily (1.5 to 2 grams of iron), but the maximum daily dose is 6 tablets (3000 mg of iron).  

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Sucroferric oxyhydroxide in children have not been established. It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment or renal (kidney) impairment. However, it's important to note that this medicine is not absorbed or metabolized systemically, therefore, liver or kidney disease should not interfere with the way this medication works.  Always follow your doctorâ€™s advice on dosages.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Diarrhea
* Darkening of stools

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Nausea

Rare side effects (less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):

* Skin rash
* Dental discoloration

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Sucroferric oxyhydroxide is a phosphate binder. In the intestines, it binds to phosphate from food, preventing its absorption into the bloodstream.  This bound phosphate is then eliminated from the body in the stool, thereby reducing the level of phosphorus in the blood.  It's important to note that Sucroferric oxyhydroxide contains iron, but its absorption into the body is minimal.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Sucroferric oxyhydroxide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, and those with hemochromatosis (iron overload) or other iron-storage disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Sucroferric oxyhydroxide can decrease the absorption of levothyroxine (thyroid hormone) and tetracycline antibiotics.  If you are taking these medications, it is vital to inform your doctor.  Levothyroxine and Sucroferric oxyhydroxide should not be taken together.  Doxycycline should be administered at least one hour before Sucroferric oxyhydroxide.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Sucroferric oxyhydroxide is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. While the absorption of iron from this medication is minimal, it's essential to discuss its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding with your healthcare provider.  Iron excretion into breast milk is unlikely.
* **Other Precautions:** The tablets should be chewed or crushed before swallowing; do not swallow them whole.  They must be taken with meals.  If you miss a dose, don't double up; simply resume with your next meal.  The use of Sucroferric oxyhydroxide in patients with certain conditions (e.g., peritonitis, significant gastric or hepatic disorders, recent major GI surgery) hasn't been extensively studied.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Sucroferric oxyhydroxide without a prescription?** A: No. This medication requires a prescription from a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How should I store Sucroferric oxyhydroxide?** A: Store the tablets at room temperature in a dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Follow the specific storage instructions on the medication label.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally take too much?** A: Contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately if you suspect an overdose.
* **Q: Can I crush or chew the tablets?** A: Yes, the tablets must be chewed or crushed before swallowing. Do not swallow them whole.
* **Q:  Will Sucroferric oxyhydroxide cause iron overload?** A:  The amount of iron absorbed from Sucroferric oxyhydroxide is minimal and generally not considered to cause iron overload, especially in patients with normal iron levels.  However, individuals with pre-existing iron storage disorders or hemochromatosis should not take this medication.  Always discuss potential iron-related concerns with your physician.
