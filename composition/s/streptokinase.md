# Streptokinase

**Generic Name:** Streptokinase

**Usage:** Streptokinase is a thrombolytic agent (clot buster) used to treat several conditions involving blood clots:

* **Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack):**  To dissolve blood clots blocking coronary arteries and restore blood flow to the heart muscle.  This is often used in conjunction with other treatments and is time-sensitive.
* **Acute ischemic stroke:**  To dissolve blood clots blocking blood vessels in the brain.  Similar to heart attack treatment, this is a time-critical intervention with stringent eligibility criteria.
* **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE):**  While less common, it can be used to treat blood clots in the deep veins of the legs (DVT) and those that have traveled to the lungs (PE).  Other treatments are generally preferred for these conditions.
* **Other occlusive vascular diseases:**  In some cases, it may be used to treat other blood clots in arteries and veins, but this is less common than its use in heart attack and stroke.


**Side Effects:**  Streptokinase can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  These include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most common and serious side effect, ranging from minor bruising to severe internal bleeding.  The risk of bleeding is increased in patients with bleeding disorders, ulcers, or those taking anticoagulants.
* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild skin rashes to life-threatening anaphylaxis.  Prior exposure to streptococcal infections can increase the risk.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  A drop in blood pressure can occur due to the systemic effect of dissolving clots.
* **Fever:**  Fever is a common side effect.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common.
* **Chest pain:** Can be related to the underlying condition or a side effect of the drug.
* **Cardiac arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats can occur.


**How it Works:** Streptokinase is an enzyme derived from bacteria (Streptococcus). It works by activating plasminogen, a naturally occurring enzyme in the blood.  Activated plasminogen (plasmin) then breaks down fibrin, the protein that forms the meshwork of a blood clot, leading to clot lysis (dissolution).


**FAQs:**

* **Is Streptokinase safe?** Streptokinase carries significant risks, primarily of bleeding.  Its use is carefully considered and only administered under close medical supervision in controlled settings like hospitals.
* **What are the contraindications?**  Contraindications include active internal bleeding, recent surgery or trauma, recent stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, bacterial endocarditis, and known allergy to streptokinase.
* **How is Streptokinase administered?** It's usually administered intravenously (IV) over a period of time, the duration depending on the condition being treated.
* **Are there alternatives to Streptokinase?** Yes, other thrombolytic agents such as alteplase (tPA) and tenecteplase are also used, and these may be preferred in certain situations due to a lower risk of bleeding or other side effects. The choice of which thrombolytic to use is based on several factors, including the specific condition, the time since symptom onset, and patient characteristics.
* **What is the recovery time?** Recovery time varies widely depending on the underlying condition and the patient's overall health. Close monitoring is necessary after treatment.
