# Streptokinase
### Generic Name
Streptokinase

### Usage
Streptokinase is a thrombolytic (clot-busting) medication primarily used to treat various blood clots.  Its main applications include:

* **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI, or heart attack):**  Streptokinase helps dissolve blood clots blocking blood flow to the heart muscle, minimizing heart damage.  It's most effective within the first 12 hours of a heart attack showing persistent ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG).

* **Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE, or blood clot in the lungs):**  It dissolves blood clots in the pulmonary arteries, improving breathing and reducing the risk of serious complications or death.

* **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT, or blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg):** Streptokinase can be used to treat extensive DVTs, breaking down the clot and reducing the risk of it traveling to the lungs (PE).

* **Peripheral Arterial Occlusion:** This refers to blood clots blocking arteries in the limbs (arms or legs). Streptokinase helps restore blood flow to the affected area.

* **Central Retinal Vein or Artery Thrombosis:** This involves blood clots in the blood vessels of the eye. Streptokinase can be used to treat these clots, though the window of opportunity is shorter (within 10 days for vein thrombosis, within 8 hours for artery thrombosis).


Streptokinase's use is typically limited to situations where other less invasive methods aren't effective or suitable.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (intravenous [IV] or intra-arterial), and the patient's overall health.  The information below is for general understanding and should **never** replace guidance from a healthcare professional.  A physician will determine the appropriate dosage and monitoring schedule based on individual circumstances.

**Adult Dosages (Examples):**  These are just examples, and actual dosage will vary significantly.

* **Acute Myocardial Infarction (IV):** Typically 1.5 million IU given over 60 minutes.
* **Acute Pulmonary Embolism (IV):**  Can range from a rapid infusion of 1.5 million IU over 1-2 hours (accelerated regimen) to a slower regimen.
* **Deep Vein Thrombosis (IV):** Common regimens involve an initial bolus of 250,000 IU followed by a continuous infusion.

**Pediatric Dosages:** Pediatric use is less common, and dosage calculations are based on weight, with precise regimens determined by a physician specializing in pediatric cardiology or hematology.

**Other Routes:**  Streptokinase can also be administered intra-arterially (directly into the artery) for peripheral arterial occlusions, with dosage depending on the location and severity of the blockage.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney impairment.

**Administration:**  Administration is typically done in a hospital setting under close medical supervision due to the risk of bleeding complications.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Antibody development (immunologic response)
* Chills
* Headache
* Malaise
* Flushing
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Fever

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bleeding (ranging from minor bruising to major hemorrhages in organs)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)


**If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Streptokinase works by activating plasminogen, a naturally occurring enzyme in the body.  This activation converts plasminogen into plasmin, which is a powerful enzyme that breaks down fibrin, the protein that forms the meshwork of a blood clot.  By dissolving the fibrin, streptokinase helps to restore blood flow.

### Precautions

**Contraindications (Situations where streptokinase should NOT be used):**

* Allergy to streptokinase or any of its components
* Active internal bleeding
* Recent stroke or head trauma
* Recent major surgery or invasive procedure
* Conditions increasing bleeding risk (e.g., hemophilia, uncontrolled high blood pressure)
* Pregnancy (though this is a complex issue and needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis)

**Interactions:**  Concomitant use of streptokinase with other medications that increase bleeding risk (e.g., anticoagulants like heparin, aspirin) should be approached with extreme caution and often avoided.

**Specific warnings:**  Older adults and patients with impaired liver or kidney function are at higher risk of complications.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does streptokinase take to work?**  A: The effect varies depending on the condition and dosage, but it can start working relatively quickly.

* **Q: How is streptokinase stored?**  A:  Refer to the specific instructions on the medication packaging. It typically requires refrigeration.

* **Q: Can I take streptokinase at home?**  A: No, streptokinase is usually administered in a hospital or other controlled medical setting due to potential side effects and the need for close monitoring.

* **Q: Are there alternatives to streptokinase?** A: Yes, there are other thrombolytic medications available, and the choice of medication depends on the individual patient's condition and factors such as prior exposure to streptokinase.
