# Suramin
### Generic Name
Suramin

### Usage
Suramin is an antiprotozoal drug primarily used in the treatment of the early stages of human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness).  Specifically, it's effective against the hemolymphatic stage (the stage before the parasite invades the central nervous system) caused by *Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense* (East African sleeping sickness).  It can also be used as an alternative treatment for the hemolymphatic stage caused by *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense* (West African sleeping sickness).  It is *not* recommended for sleeping sickness that has progressed to the central nervous system (CNS) stage.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Suramin administration should only be performed by healthcare professionals experienced in managing sleeping sickness. Dosage adjustments are crucial and depend on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  The information below is for general understanding and should not replace guidance from a medical professional.

**Adults (Trypanosomiasis, Hemolymphatic Stage):**

*   Initially, a test dose of 100 mg is given intravenously (IV).
*   This is followed by 1 g IV on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21.

**Children (Trypanosomiasis, Hemolymphatic Stage):**

*   Initially, a test dose of 2 mg/kg is given intravenously (IV).
*   This is followed by 20 mg/kg IV (up to a maximum of 1 g) on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Suramin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (kidney problems) and should be avoided in those with severe hepatic impairment (liver problems).  Careful monitoring of kidney function is essential during treatment.


### Side Effects

Suramin can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity and frequency.  These include:

*   **Common:**  Headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite.
*   **Less Common, but Serious:**  Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities),  renal impairment (kidney damage), proteinuria (protein in the urine),  hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, potentially severe),  optic atrophy (damage to the optic nerve),  pancytopenia (decrease in all blood cell types).

**Important:**  If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Suramin's precise mechanism of action isn't fully understood but is believed to involve the inhibition of enzymes involved in the oxidation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) within the trypanosome parasite. NADH is a vital coenzyme in many cellular processes, and disrupting its function interferes with the parasite's metabolism and survival.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Suramin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to suramin or any of its components.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  No specific drug interactions are comprehensively documented, but caution is advised when using suramin concurrently with other medications, especially those affecting kidney or liver function.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While suramin is toxic, it's sometimes used to treat pregnant women with *T. brucei rhodesiense* trypanosomiasis in the hemolymphatic stage.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks, and under strict medical supervision. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
*   **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Suramin is contraindicated in severe renal impairment and should be used cautiously in patients with liver problems.  Close monitoring of kidney and liver function is essential during treatment.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How is suramin administered?**  A: Suramin is administered intravenously (IV) by slow infusion.

*   **Q: How is suramin stored?** A: Store suramin as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

*   **Q: Is suramin safe for everyone?**  A: No. Suramin has several contraindications and potential side effects.  Its use should be carefully considered based on individual health status, and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not attempt to self-adjust doses. Consult your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a dose.

*   **Q:  Are there alternative treatments for sleeping sickness?** A: Yes, other medications exist to treat sleeping sickness, particularly in later stages or for different parasite species. Your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment based on your specific situation.
