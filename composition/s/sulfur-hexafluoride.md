# Sulfur Hexafluoride
### Generic Name
Sulfur Hexafluoride

### Usage

Sulfur hexafluoride is an ultrasound contrast agent used to enhance the quality of ultrasound images in various medical procedures.  Its primary use is in echocardiography, where it improves visualization of the left ventricle's endocardial border in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms. This is particularly helpful in assessing heart function.  Secondary uses include:

* **Liver ultrasonography:**  It aids in characterizing focal liver lesions (abnormal areas in the liver) by improving image contrast.
* **Urinary tract ultrasonography (pediatric):**  It helps evaluate suspected or known vesicoureteral reflux (backward flow of urine from the bladder to the ureters).
* **Doppler assessment of blood vessels:**  It enhances the quality of Doppler ultrasound images of cerebral, carotid, peripheral, abdominal, renal, and portal arteries, improving the accuracy of blood flow assessments.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the procedure, the patient's age and weight, and the specific indication.  Always refer to the prescribing information for precise guidance. The following is for informational purposes only and should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional.

**Adults:**

* **Cardiovascular imaging (Echocardiography):** 2 mL administered intravenously (IV) as a bolus injection. A second 2 mL dose may be given if needed.
* **Liver ultrasonography:** 2.4 mL administered intravenously as a bolus injection. A second 2.4 mL dose may be given if needed.
* **Diagnostic vessel assessment (Doppler ultrasound):** 1.2 mL intravenously. A second 1.2 mL dose may be administered during the procedure.

**Pediatrics:**

* **Cardiovascular imaging (Echocardiography):** 0.03 mL/kg intravenously.  Maximum dose: 2 mL.
* **Liver ultrasonography:** 0.03 mL/kg intravenously. Maximum dose: 2.4 mL.
* **Urinary tract ultrasonography:** 1 mL instilled intravesically (into the bladder) via a catheter.

**Important Note:**  Following each injection, the intravenous line should be flushed with 5 mL of 0.9% saline solution. The mechanical index on the ultrasound machine needs to be adjusted to a lower setting (typically ≤0.8 for echocardiography and ≤0.4 for liver and urinary tract imaging) after baseline images are obtained.


### Side Effects

* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Hypoxia (low blood oxygen)
* Stridor (high-pitched breathing sound)
* Wheezing
* Facial hypoesthesia (numbness)

* Anaphylactic shock
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Bronchospasm


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Sulfur hexafluoride, when administered intravenously, forms microspheres that circulate in the bloodstream.  These microspheres have a different acoustic impedance than surrounding tissues.  When an ultrasound beam encounters the interface between the microspheres and the tissue, it reflects more strongly, increasing the signal intensity and improving the contrast of the ultrasound image.  This allows for better visualization of blood vessels and organs. In the urinary tract, the microspheres increase the signal intensity of fluids within the urinary tract, improving image quality.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Sulfur hexafluoride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, known right-to-left cardiac shunts, severe pulmonary hypertension, uncontrolled systemic hypertension, and adult respiratory distress syndrome.
* **Warnings:**  Serious cardiopulmonary reactions, including fatalities, have been reported.  Resuscitation equipment and trained personnel should be readily available during and after administration.  The risk of serious anaphylactoid reactions (severe allergic reactions) is also increased. Close monitoring for these reactions is crucial.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sulfur hexafluoride is categorized as pregnancy category B.  The effect on breastfeeding is unknown.  Consult with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is sulfur hexafluoride stored?**  A: Storage requirements should be found on the product labeling, but generally, it involves keeping the medication at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: How long does the effect of sulfur hexafluoride last?** A: The duration of effect depends on the procedure and dosage, but the contrast enhancement is typically temporary.

* **Q: Is sulfur hexafluoride safe?** A: While generally safe, like all medications, sulfur hexafluoride carries risks, including serious side effects. Careful monitoring and adherence to the prescribed dosage and administration guidelines are essential.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Sulfur hexafluoride is typically administered as a single dose during a specific procedure; there are no scheduled repeat doses.  Consult your doctor if you have any questions.
