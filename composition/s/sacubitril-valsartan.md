# Sacubitril + Valsartan
### Generic Name
Sacubitril/Valsartan

### Usage
Sacubitril/Valsartan is primarily used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in adults.  This means it's prescribed for people whose hearts aren't pumping blood as efficiently as they should.  It's particularly beneficial for those who have already experienced a worsening of their heart failure symptoms or have been hospitalized for it. While not its primary indication, it may also play a supportive role in improving overall cardiovascular health in certain patients with HFrEF.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* a first-line treatment for all types of heart failure and its use should be determined by a cardiologist.


### Dosage
Dosage is individualized and determined by a physician based on the patient's overall health and response to treatment.  It's typically started at a low dose and gradually increased.

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose is 24 mg/26 mg (sacubitril/valsartan) once daily. After a week, this may be increased to the target dose of 49mg/51 mg once daily, depending on tolerability.  Dosage adjustments should always be guided by a healthcare professional.

* **IV Administration:** Sacubitril/Valsartan is not available in an intravenous (IV) formulation.  It is administered orally only.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Cough
* Renal impairment (kidney problems)

Less common, but serious side effects include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) â€“ This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* Worsening of kidney function
* Irregular heartbeat


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly angioedema, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Sacubitril/Valsartan is a combination drug containing two active ingredients: sacubitril and valsartan.  Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor.  Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down several beneficial peptides, including natriuretic peptides, which help the body manage fluid and blood pressure. By inhibiting neprilysin, sacubitril increases the levels of these peptides, improving the heart's ability to pump blood. Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  Angiotensin II is a hormone that constricts blood vessels, raising blood pressure.  Valsartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, helping to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure.  The combined effect of sacubitril and valsartan leads to improved heart function and reduced symptoms of heart failure.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Sacubitril/Valsartan should not be used in patients with a history of angioedema, severe renal impairment, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, particularly ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, and other medications affecting kidney function or blood pressure. Always inform your physician of all medications you are taking.
* **Kidney Function:**  Close monitoring of kidney function is crucial, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Sacubitril/Valsartan is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, requiring careful dose adjustments.
