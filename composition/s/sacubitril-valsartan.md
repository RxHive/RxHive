# Sacubitril + Valsartan

**Generic Name:** Sacubitril/Valsartan

**Usage:**

Sacubitril/Valsartan is used to treat heart failure in adults.  It's specifically for those who have already had a heart attack or have chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).  This means the heart isn't pumping blood as efficiently as it should. It is usually prescribed *in addition* to other heart failure medications, not as a sole treatment.  It's important to follow your doctor's instructions and take it exactly as prescribed.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.
* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels):**  This can be serious and requires monitoring.
* **Kidney problems:**  Your kidney function may need to be monitored while taking this medication.
* **Cough:** A persistent cough is a relatively common side effect.
* **Nausea:** Some people experience nausea or vomiting.
* **Dizziness:**  This is often related to low blood pressure.
* **Muscle cramps:** This is less common.

Serious side effects, though less frequent, can occur.  These include angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) which is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention.


**How it Works:**

Sacubitril/Valsartan is a combination drug containing two active ingredients:

* **Sacubitril:**  This is a neprilysin inhibitor. Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down peptides (small proteins) that help relax blood vessels and reduce stress on the heart. By inhibiting neprilysin, sacubitril increases the levels of these beneficial peptides.

* **Valsartan:** This is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow and increases blood pressure. Valsartan blocks the effects of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and lower blood pressure.

Together, sacubitril and valsartan work to improve the heart's ability to pump blood and reduce strain on the cardiovascular system.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Sacubitril/Valsartan with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  Certain interactions are possible, and your doctor will help determine safe combinations.  Never suddenly stop taking other heart medications without consulting your doctor.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **How long will I need to take Sacubitril/Valsartan?**  This is determined by your doctor and depends on your individual condition and response to the medication.  It is usually a long-term treatment.

* **What are the signs of a serious side effect?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe dizziness, fainting, or difficulty breathing.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Sacubitril/Valsartan?**  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor. Excessive alcohol use can interact with this medication and worsen heart conditions.

* **Is Sacubitril/Valsartan right for me?** This is a question only your doctor can answer.  They will consider your medical history, current medications, and overall health to determine if this drug is appropriate for your situation.
