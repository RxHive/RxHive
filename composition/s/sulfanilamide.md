# Sulfanilamide
### Generic Name
Sulfanilamide

### Usage
Sulfanilamide is a topical sulfonamide primarily used to treat vulvovaginitis (vaginal inflammation) caused by *Candida albicans*, a type of yeast.  It's important to note that while it *can* be used for this purpose,  other antifungal agents, such as topical antifungals or oral fluconazole, are generally preferred and considered more effective for uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.  Sulfanilamide is not typically considered a first-line or alternative treatment for this condition.

### Dosage
**Vulvovaginitis caused by *Candida albicans***:  The usual dosage is one applicatorful (approximately 6 grams) of the intravaginal cream or ointment once daily (OD) or twice daily (BID) for 30 days.  

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of sulfanilamide in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using this medication if you have liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are rare but may include local hypersensitivity reactions such as localized burning or discomfort.

Serious, but less common side effects, are possible, especially with systemic sulfonamides (although this is a topical preparation). These include:

*   Serious hypersensitivity reactions
*   Blood disorders (agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia)
*   Liver damage (including fatal hepatic necrosis)
*   Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)

**If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works
Sulfanilamide works by competitively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria.  Folic acid is essential for bacterial growth and reproduction. By interfering with folic acid production, sulfanilamide prevents the growth and multiplication of *Candida albicans*, eventually leading to its elimination.  This mechanism applies specifically to bacteria; the impact on yeast is less well-defined.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Sulfanilamide is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to sulfanilamide, any other sulfonamide, or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, blood disorders, liver damage, and severe skin reactions with sulfonamide use.  The risk is heightened in patients with pre-existing conditions.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Sulfanilamide is categorized as pregnancy category C.  Vaginal products should be used cautiously after the seventh month of pregnancy, and other treatments are generally preferred during pregnancy. Sulfonamides are excreted in breast milk and may cause kernicterus in newborns; a decision should be made on whether to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug.

**Drug Interactions:** Sulfanilamide may interact with other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness.  It can increase serum concentrations of drugs such as cilostazol, fesoterodine, thioridazine, and metoprolol, and decrease the effectiveness of BCG and sodium picosulfate.  The risk of adverse effects increases when used with mecamylamine.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
