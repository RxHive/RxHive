# Saxagliptin + Dapagliflozin

**Generic Name:** Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin

**Usage:**

Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin is a combination medication used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's typically prescribed when diet, exercise, and metformin alone are not enough to control blood sugar levels.  It may be used alone or in combination with other diabetes medications.  The specific dosage and combination will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and health status.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Upper respiratory tract infections:**  Cold-like symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny nose.
* **Headache:**  Mild to moderate headaches.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** Especially if used with other diabetes medications like insulin or sulfonylureas. Symptoms may include dizziness, sweating, shakiness, confusion.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Increased risk, particularly in women.
* **Yeast infections (candidiasis):**  Increased risk, especially genital yeast infections.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Constipation or diarrhea:** Changes in bowel habits.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  Severe abdominal pain, often radiating to the back.  Seek immediate medical attention.
* **Kidney problems:**  Especially if you already have kidney disease.  Monitor kidney function regularly while taking this medication.
* **Dehydration:** Due to increased urination.  Drink plenty of fluids.
* **Ketoacidosis (a serious complication of diabetes):**  Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, shortness of breath, fruity-smelling breath. Seek immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:**

Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin works through two different mechanisms to improve blood sugar control:

* **Saxagliptin:** This is a DPP-4 inhibitor. It works by increasing the levels of incretins, hormones that help the pancreas release insulin when blood sugar is high and decrease the amount of glucose the liver produces.
* **Dapagliflozin:** This is an SGLT2 inhibitor. It works by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, causing the body to excrete excess glucose in the urine.  This helps to lower blood sugar levels.

By combining these two mechanisms, Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin offers a synergistic effect on blood glucose control.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin if I have kidney problems?** A:  Use caution if you have kidney problems.  Your doctor will need to carefully monitor your kidney function. This medication may not be suitable for those with severe kidney disease.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin?** A: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of hypoglycemia and interact with other medications. Discuss with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin cause weight loss?** A:  Dapagliflozin can contribute to some weight loss due to increased glucose excretion in the urine. However, weight loss should not be the primary reason for taking this medication.
