# Salbutamol + Guaifenesin
### Generic Name
Salbutamol + Guaifenesin

### Usage
Salbutamol + Guaifenesin is a combination medication used to treat symptoms of chest congestion and shortness of breath, particularly in conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Salbutamol, a beta-2 agonist, works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, opening them up and making breathing easier. Guaifenesin, an expectorant, helps thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up and clear the congestion.  This combination is effective in providing relief from both the bronchospasm (constriction of the airways) and the mucus build-up that often accompany respiratory illnesses. While primarily used for acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD, it may also be used to manage symptoms in other respiratory conditions where bronchospasm and mucus production are prominent.  It is important to note that this combination is for symptom relief and does not treat the underlying cause of the respiratory condition.  Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any respiratory illness.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablets, syrup, liquid), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of the condition.  Always follow the prescription provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  

**Adults (Oral):**  Typical dosages vary widely depending on the specific product.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for the correct dosage based on your individual needs.  Improper dosing can lead to both ineffective treatment and adverse events.


**Children (Oral):**  Dosage for children is strictly determined by weight and age.  A physician will provide specific guidelines as the safe dosage depends significantly on the child's developmental stage and overall health.  Never administer medication to children without a doctor's explicit instructions.


**IV Administration:**  Salbutamol and guaifenesin are not typically administered intravenously together. Salbutamol may be given intravenously in hospital settings for severe bronchospasm, but this is under strict medical supervision. Guaifenesin is not typically administered intravenously.


**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge only.  The exact dosage must be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual circumstances.  Never alter your prescribed dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.

* Chest pain


If you experience any serious or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Salbutamol stimulates beta-2 receptors in the lungs, leading to relaxation of the airway smooth muscles and bronchodilation (widening of the airways). This improves airflow and reduces shortness of breath. Guaifenesin acts as an expectorant by reducing the viscosity (thickness) of mucus, making it easier to cough up.  The combined effect provides relief from both bronchospasm and mucus congestion in the respiratory tract.
