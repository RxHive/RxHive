# Salbutamol + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Salbutamol + Guaifenesin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat chest congestion and wheezing associated with respiratory illnesses like bronchitis, asthma, and emphysema.  Salbutamol, a bronchodilator, opens up the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. Guaifenesin, an expectorant, helps loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.  It's crucial to understand that this is a symptomatic treatment and does not address the underlying cause of the respiratory illness.  Always follow a doctor's prescription and instructions.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **From Salbutamol:** Tremors, nervousness, headache, increased heart rate, muscle cramps, dizziness, insomnia.  Rare but serious side effects include: paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of wheezing), allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling).
* **From Guaifenesin:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, headache, dizziness.  Rare side effects are less common.

*Note: This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects.*

**How it Works:**

* **Salbutamol:** This beta-2 agonist works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs. This widening of the airways reduces wheezing and shortness of breath.
* **Guaifenesin:** This expectorant works by increasing the fluid content of the mucus in the respiratory tract. This makes the mucus less viscous and easier to cough up, thereby clearing congestion.
