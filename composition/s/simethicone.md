# Simethicone

**Generic Name:** Simethicone

**Usage:**

Simethicone is used to relieve pain and discomfort caused by gas in the stomach and intestines.  It's often used to treat symptoms of:

* **Gas:**  Excess gas buildup leading to bloating, discomfort, and abdominal pressure.
* **Flatulence:** Excessive passage of gas from the rectum.
* **Bloating:** A feeling of fullness or tightness in the abdomen.

It's important to note that simethicone does *not* treat the underlying cause of gas, only the symptoms.


**Side Effects:**

Simethicone is generally well-tolerated and considered safe.  Side effects are rare, but may include:

* **Constipation:** Although uncommon, some individuals may experience constipation.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any allergic reaction.

**How it Works:**

Simethicone works by altering the surface tension of gas bubbles in the digestive tract.  This allows the smaller bubbles to coalesce into larger bubbles, which are then more easily passed through the rectum as gas.  It doesn't absorb into the bloodstream and is eliminated unchanged in the stool.
