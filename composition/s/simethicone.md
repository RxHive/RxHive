# Simethicone
### Generic Name
Simethicone

### Usage
Simethicone is primarily used to relieve the symptoms associated with excessive gas in the gastrointestinal tract.  These symptoms include bloating, flatulence (gas), discomfort, and pain. It's a common over-the-counter remedy for these issues.  While it doesn't actually reduce the *amount* of gas in the body, it alters the surface tension of gas bubbles, making them easier to pass.  There are no other notable secondary uses beyond alleviating gas-related symptoms.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on age and the formulation of simethicone. Always follow the instructions on the product label, or as directed by a healthcare professional.

**Adults:** For flatulence and bloating, the typical adult dose is 40-360 mg taken four times a day (QID) after meals, not exceeding a total daily dose of 500 mg.

**Children:**  Dosage for children is dependent on their age:

* **Under 2 years:**  20 mg (often 0.3 mL of liquid formulation) every 6 hours after meals and at bedtime, not exceeding 240 mg per day.
* **2-12 years:** 40 mg (often 0.6 mL of liquid formulation) every 6 hours after meals and at bedtime, not exceeding 480 mg per day.
* **Over 12 years:**  The dosage is similar to adults, typically 40-360 mg every 6 hours after meals and at bedtime, not exceeding 500 mg per day.


Different formulations of simethicone exist, including tablets (chewable or regular), capsules, and liquid suspensions (syrups).  Always administer the medication as directed on the product packaging.  Chewable tablets should be thoroughly chewed before swallowing.


### Side Effects
Simethicone is generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience:

* Nausea
* Loose stools
* Diarrhea

These side effects are usually mild and temporary.  However, if you experience any severe or persistent side effects, discontinue use and consult a doctor immediately.  Serious side effects are rare.


### How it Works
Simethicone is an anti-foaming agent. It works by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract.  This allows smaller gas bubbles to coalesce into larger bubbles, which are then more easily expelled from the body, relieving the symptoms of bloating and gas.  Simethicone is not absorbed into the bloodstream, meaning it acts locally within the digestive system.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:**  Avoid simethicone if you have a known allergy to simethicone or any of its components.
* **Gastrointestinal Obstruction/Perforation:**  Use with caution in patients with a suspected or known gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation.  Simethicone should not be used in these cases.
* **Interactions:**  Although rare, concurrent use with levothyroxine (a thyroid hormone) may decrease the absorption of levothyroxine. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Simethicone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. This means studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.  The excretion of simethicone in breast milk is unknown, so use caution while breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Always follow the pediatric dosage guidelines carefully and consult a doctor for any concerns.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for simethicone to work?**  A: Simethicone typically provides relief within a short time, often within minutes to an hour, after administration.

* **Q: Can I take simethicone with other medications?** A: Generally, simethicone is safe to use with most medications, but it's always best to check with your doctor or pharmacist, especially if you are on medications for thyroid conditions.

* **Q: How should I store simethicone?** A: Store simethicone as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and extreme temperatures. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is simethicone habit-forming?** A: No, simethicone is not habit-forming.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
