# Secretin
### Generic Name
Secretin

### Usage
Secretin is a synthetic peptide hormone primarily used in diagnosing pancreatic exocrine dysfunction and gastrinoma (a rare tumor that produces excessive gastrin).  It works by stimulating the pancreas to release bicarbonate and the stomach to release gastrin.  Measuring these secretions helps determine if the pancreas or the stomach is functioning correctly.  Additionally, secretin is used to aid in the visualization of the ampulla of Vater and accessory papilla during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a procedure used to examine the bile and pancreatic ducts.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Diagnosis of Gastrinoma:** 0.4 mcg/kg intravenously (IV) as a single dose.
* **Diagnosis of Pancreatic Dysfunction & ERCP:** 0.2 mcg/kg IV as a single dose.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of secretin in children have not been established.

**Administration:** Secretin is administered intravenously over one minute.  For IV administration, reconstitute the vial with the appropriate amount of normal saline (NS) as directed by the product instructions.  Always use immediately after reconstitution and discard any unused portion.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic or renal impairment; however, patients with hepatic impairment might be more sensitive to secretin.  Additional testing might be necessary in such cases.  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or those who have undergone vagotomy may show a reduced response, potentially leading to misdiagnosis. Additional testing should be considered.

### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Nausea

**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Abdominal distress
* Flushing
* Vomiting


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Secretin is a naturally occurring hormone primarily released by the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) in response to acidic chyme (partially digested food) entering from the stomach.  It stimulates the pancreas to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid, which helps neutralize stomach acid in the duodenum.  This process is crucial for optimal digestion. Secretin also stimulates gastrin release from the stomach, aiding in the diagnosis of gastrinoma.  The precise mechanisms of action in aiding ERCP are related to its effects on the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Use with Caution:** Secretin should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment (including alcohol-related liver disease), inflammatory bowel disease, or those who have undergone vagotomy. These patients may respond differently to the test, potentially leading to inaccurate results.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Secretin is categorized as pregnancy category C. Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  It's unknown whether secretin is excreted in breast milk.  The decision to breastfeed while using secretin requires careful consideration of the potential risks to the infant versus the benefits of breastfeeding and treatment for the mother.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticholinergic agents may reduce secretin's effectiveness.  It's crucial to discontinue anticholinergics, H2-receptor antagonists, and proton pump inhibitors several days prior to testing with secretin to prevent interference with the results.

### FAQs

**Q: How long should I fast before a secretin test?**

A: Typically, a 12-15 hour fast is required before the test.

**Q: How is secretin administered?**

A: Secretin is given intravenously (IV) over one minute.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A: Report any side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.

**Q: How is secretin stored?**

A: Follow the storage instructions provided with the medication. Generally, unused portions should be discarded.

**Q:  What are the implications of abnormal secretin test results?**

A: Abnormal results may indicate pancreatic insufficiency, gastrinoma, or other underlying conditions.  Your doctor will discuss the results and what they mean for your health.  Further testing is often required to reach a definitive diagnosis.
