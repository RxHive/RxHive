# Sulfiram (Topical)
### Generic Name
Sulfiram (Topical)

### Usage
Sulfiram topical is primarily used in the treatment and prevention of scabies, a contagious skin infestation caused by the *Sarcoptes scabiei* mite.  It's applied topically as a medicated soap.

### Dosage
**Scabies (Treatment and Prevention):**

* **Adults and Children:** A warm bath should be taken, and then the sulfiram medicated soap is applied liberally to the entire body, paying special attention to skin folds and areas where mites frequently reside. After application, blot the skin dry with a towel.  Specific instructions regarding the duration of soap application and the frequency of treatment will vary depending on the product formulation and the healthcare provider's recommendations.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a physician before using this medication if you have any liver or kidney conditions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are not clearly defined in available information but may include:

* Erythematous rash (red, inflamed skin)
* Itching
* Dry skin
* Paresthesia (tingling or pricking sensation)

While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  Any unusual or concerning reactions warrant immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action for topical sulfiram in treating scabies is not fully elucidated but is believed to involve photolysis â€“ a chemical decomposition process triggered by light exposure.  It's thought that this process contributes to the elimination of the *Sarcoptes scabiei* mites.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Sulfiram topical is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to sulfiram or any components of the formulation.
* **Alcohol Use:** Patients should abstain from alcohol consumption for at least 48 hours before and after applying the soap, as interactions with alcohol are possible although not specifically detailed for topical formulations.  
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of topical sulfiram during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Consult a healthcare professional before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** While the dosage is the same for adults and children, close supervision is advised, especially for young children to prevent accidental ingestion.
