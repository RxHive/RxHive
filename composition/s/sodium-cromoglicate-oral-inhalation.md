# Sodium Cromoglicate (Oral inhalation)
### Generic Name
Sodium Cromoglicate (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage

Sodium cromoglicate, also known as cromolyn sodium, is a medication primarily used to prevent asthma attacks and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) symptoms.  It works by stabilizing mast cells, preventing the release of substances that trigger allergic reactions.  While its primary use is for preventing these conditions, it also has some secondary, less common uses. These include treating allergic conjunctivitis (eye inflammation), systemic mastocytosis (a rare disorder affecting mast cells), and sometimes ulcerative colitis, though its effectiveness in these latter conditions is less established.  Importantly, sodium cromoglicate is *not* used to treat an acute asthma attack that's already in progress.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the form of the medication (inhalation powder, nasal spray, eye drops, oral solution), and the patient's age.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  

**Adults:**

* **Allergic Rhinitis (Nasal Spray):** Typically, 2.5 or 5 mg of a 2% or 4% solution is sprayed into each nostril four times daily.
* **Asthma Prophylaxis (Inhalation):**  The usual dose is 20 mg four times a day as a dry powder or nebulized solution, or 10 mg four times a day as an aerosol. The doctor may adjust this, potentially increasing the frequency to six or eight times daily in severe cases, or decreasing it once the asthma is well-controlled.
* **Allergic Conjunctivitis (Eye Drops):** 2 drops of a 4% solution are instilled into the affected eye four to six times daily, or a 4% ointment may be applied two to three times daily.
* **Food Allergy/Mastocytosis (Oral):**  The usual starting dose is 200mg four times daily, potentially doubling the dose if there's insufficient response after 2-3 weeks. The maximum daily dose is 40mg/kg of body weight.

**Children:**

Dosage for children, especially for oral administration in conditions like food allergies or mastocytosis, needs to be determined by a doctor based on their weight and age.  A common starting dose for oral use in children is 100mg four times a day, with the maximum dose also being 40mg/kg/day.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Unpleasant taste
* Joint pain
* Swelling
* Skin rashes
* Throat irritation (with inhalation)
* Nasal congestion (with nasal spray)
* Cough, wheezing, and bronchospasm (though paradoxically, these can indicate a worsening of the underlying condition).


Less common, but potentially more serious side effects, such as pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia (lung inflammation), urticaria (hives), and other allergic reactions, require immediate medical attention.  If you experience any concerning side effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Sodium cromoglicate works by preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from mast cells.  Mast cells are immune cells that play a key role in allergic reactions.  When an allergen (like pollen or pet dander) triggers an allergic reaction, mast cells release these substances, causing symptoms like inflammation, bronchospasm (constriction of the airways), and mucus production.  By stabilizing the mast cells and preventing the release of these inflammatory mediators, sodium cromoglicate helps prevent allergic reactions from occurring in the first place.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sodium cromoglicate should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or its components.  It is not appropriate for treating an acute asthma attack.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While generally considered safe, it's essential to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to check for potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of sodium cromoglicate during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  For eye drops, avoid contact with soft contact lenses.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects of sodium cromoglicate are not immediate.  It typically takes 1-2 days to notice some benefit, with full relief potentially taking 1-2 weeks of regular use.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it once my symptoms improve?** A: No, continued daily use is usually necessary to maintain control of symptoms, even if you feel better.  Discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store according to the instructions on the label; generally, this involves storing it at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.  Avoid freezing.

* **Q: Can I use different forms together (e.g., nasal spray and inhaler)?** A: Only use the forms and dosages prescribed by your doctor.  Combining different forms or dosages without medical supervision isn't recommended.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any concerning side effects, even mild ones, to your doctor or pharmacist.  They can advise you on whether to continue treatment or adjust your dosage.
