# Salbutamol + Beclometasone

**Generic Name:** Salbutamol + Beclometasone Dipropionate

**Usage:**  This combination inhaler is used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing caused by asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Salbutamol (a short-acting beta2-agonist) quickly relieves symptoms by relaxing the muscles around the airways, while Beclometasone Dipropionate (a corticosteroid) reduces airway inflammation in the long term, preventing future attacks.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and not to use it to treat an acute attack without other instructions from a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and can be mild or severe. Common side effects include:

* **From Salbutamol:** Tremors, headache, muscle cramps, palpitations, increased heart rate.  Rarely, serious cardiovascular effects can occur.
* **From Beclometasone Dipropionate:**  Oral thrush (fungal infection in the mouth), hoarseness, throat irritation, headache.  Long-term use can lead to slowed growth in children, cataracts, glaucoma, and increased risk of osteoporosis (bone thinning).  Less common but potentially serious side effects include bruising easily and adrenal suppression.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Salbutamol:**  Works by binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs, causing relaxation of the airway smooth muscles. This widens the airways, making it easier to breathe.  The effect is rapid, usually within minutes.
* **Beclometasone Dipropionate:**  Is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the airways. It suppresses the immune response that contributes to asthma and COPD symptoms.  This effect is not immediate and takes time to build up.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I use this inhaler as needed or only on a schedule?**  This depends entirely on your doctor's prescription. Some people use it as a preventative inhaler daily, while others might use it as a "reliever" inhaler only when needed for symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Can I use this inhaler with other medications?**  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as there may be interactions.

* **What are the signs of a serious side effect?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, severe headache, or significant changes in vision.

* **How should I store the inhaler?**  Store as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **How long does it take to work?** Salbutamol provides quick relief, while Beclometasone Dipropionate requires regular use over time to achieve its full effect.
