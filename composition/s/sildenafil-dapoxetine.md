# Sildenafil + Dapoxetine
### Generic Name
Sildenafil + Dapoxetine

### Usage
Sildenafil + Dapoxetine is a combination medication used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) in adult men.  Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor, works by increasing blood flow to the penis, facilitating an erection. Dapoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), helps delay ejaculation by affecting the neurotransmitters in the brain responsible for ejaculatory reflexes.  This combination addresses both the inability to achieve and maintain an erection (ED) and the rapid ejaculation (PE) experienced by many men.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the symptoms, not the underlying cause of ED or PE.


### Dosage
Dosage should always be determined by a physician based on individual needs and health status.  There is no standardized pediatric use for this combination medication.  The typical adult dosage for oral administration is a single tablet taken as directed by a doctor.  The specific dose of sildenafil and dapoxetine within the combination tablet will vary depending on the manufacturer and prescription.  This medication is only available in tablet form for oral administration; it is not available intravenously (IV).  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage regimen exactly as directed by your healthcare professional. Never exceed the recommended dose.  Taking more than prescribed will not enhance effectiveness and could increase the risk of side effects.

### How it Works
Sildenafil works by inhibiting the PDE5 enzyme, which is responsible for breaking down cyclic GMP, a molecule that helps relax the muscles in the penis, increasing blood flow.  This increased blood flow facilitates an erection in response to sexual stimulation.  Dapoxetine increases serotonin levels in the brain, delaying ejaculation by affecting the neurotransmitters that regulate the ejaculatory reflex. The combination of these two mechanisms addresses both ED and PE.
