# Solifenacin
### Generic Name
Solifenacin

### Usage
Solifenacin is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is characterized by urinary symptoms such as urgency (a sudden, strong urge to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than usual), and urge incontinence (leakage of urine due to urgency).  Solifenacin helps to relax the bladder muscle, reducing the frequency and urgency of urination.

In addition to its primary use in adults, solifenacin is also used to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity in children aged 2 years and older.  Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is a condition where the bladder muscle contracts involuntarily, often due to a neurological condition.


### Dosage

**Adults (Overactive Bladder):**  The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily.  If tolerated, the dose may be increased to 10 mg once daily.

**Children (Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity):** Dosage is determined by weight and adjusted as needed.  It's administered as an oral suspension (1 mg/mL).  The initial dose and maximum daily dose vary based on weight:

* **9-15 kg:** Initial 2 mg once daily; maximum 4 mg/day
* **>15-30 kg:** Initial 3 mg once daily; maximum 5 mg/day
* **>30-45 kg:** Initial 3 mg once daily; maximum 6 mg/day
* **>45-60 kg:** Initial 4 mg once daily; maximum 8 mg/day
* **>60 kg:** Initial 5 mg once daily; maximum 10 mg/day

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for precise dosing instructions tailored to individual needs.

### How it Works

Solifenacin is an anticholinergic medication.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates bladder muscle contractions.  By blocking acetylcholine, solifenacin relaxes the bladder muscle, reducing the urge to urinate and decreasing the frequency of urination.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Solifenacin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to solifenacin, urinary retention (for tablet form only), gastric retention, and uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Interactions:**  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole) and inducers (such as rifampin) can significantly affect solifenacin levels. Concomitant use should be avoided or closely monitored by a physician.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are needed in patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal impairment.  Solifenacin should be used with caution in patients with mild hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Solifenacin is a Pregnancy Category C drug.  The decision to use solifenacin during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, carefully weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks.
* **Geriatric Patients:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of solifenacin. Close monitoring is often recommended.
* **Other Precautions:** Solifenacin may cause drowsiness or blurred vision; patients should avoid driving or operating machinery if affected. Patients should also be advised to drink plenty of fluids to help prevent constipation.
