**Generic Name:** Sulfacetamide + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial infections of the eye that are accompanied by allergic symptoms.  The sulfacetamide component fights the bacterial infection, while the chlorpheniramine maleate component helps relieve allergic symptoms like itching, redness, and swelling. It's usually applied as eye drops or ointment.  **Important Note:** This information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice. Always consult a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional before using this or any medication.  Self-treating can be harmful.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, or itching of the eyes.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (in rare cases â€“ seek immediate medical attention).
* **Temporary blurred vision:** This usually subsides quickly.

Less common but more serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Eye pain
* Increased eye discharge


**How it Works:**

* **Sulfacetamide:** This is a sulfonamide antibiotic that works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. It disrupts the bacteria's ability to produce folic acid, a vital nutrient for their survival and reproduction.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions. By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms of allergies such as itching, redness, and swelling.
