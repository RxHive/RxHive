# Sinecatechins
### Generic Name
Sinecatechins

### Usage
Sinecatechins ointment is a topical medication specifically used to treat external genital and perianal warts (condylomata acuminata) in adults (18 years and older) with healthy immune systems (immunocompetent).  It's crucial to understand that this medication is for external warts only and is not suitable for warts inside the urethra, vagina, cervix, rectum, or anus.  It also should not be used by individuals with weakened immune systems.

### Dosage
For adults, apply a small amount of Sinecatechins ointment (approximately a 0.5-cm strand) to each affected wart every eight hours.  Continue treatment until all warts are completely cleared, but treatment should not exceed 16 weeks.  The ointment is for topical use only; do not ingest it.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism by which sinecatechins clears genital and perianal warts isn't fully understood.  While it has demonstrated antioxidant properties in laboratory settings, the clinical significance of this is unclear.

### Precautions

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to sinecatechins or its components.
* Warts located inside the urethra, vagina, cervix, rectum, or anus.
* Weakened immune systems (immunosuppressed patients).
