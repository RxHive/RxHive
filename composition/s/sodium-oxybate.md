# Sodium Oxybate
### Generic Name
Sodium Oxybate

### Usage

Sodium oxybate is primarily used to treat cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in individuals aged 7 years and older with narcolepsy.  Cataplexy refers to sudden, brief episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis, often triggered by strong emotions. EDS is characterized by overwhelming daytime sleepiness despite adequate nighttime sleep.  While its primary use is in narcolepsy, research is ongoing to explore potential applications in other sleep disorders.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Narcolepsy):**

Treatment begins with an initial dose of 2.25 grams (g) at bedtime, after the patient is already in bed. A second dose of 2.25 g is given 2.5 to 4 hours later (totaling 4.5 g per night).  The dosage is gradually increased by 1.5 g per night (0.75 g per dose) at weekly intervals, as tolerated, until the optimal effect is achieved. The usual effective dosage range is 6 to 9 g per night, with a maximum dose of 9 g per night. If the second dose is missed, it should be skipped, and treatment resumed the following night; do not double the dose.  Sodium oxybate is administered orally, in liquid solution.

**Pediatric Dosage (Narcolepsy):**

Dosage for children aged 7 years and older with narcolepsy is weight-based and requires careful titration under a healthcare professional's supervision.  Lower starting doses are used, and increases are made more gradually than in adults.  The maximum daily dose varies depending on the child's weight. Specific dosing instructions should be obtained from the child's physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The initial nightly dose should be reduced by half, divided into two doses.  Close monitoring is essential.
* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment.  Use with caution and under close medical supervision.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Confusion
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Weight loss
* Urinary incontinence

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, but requiring immediate medical attention):**

* Severe drowsiness
* Depression
* Sleepwalking (somnambulism)
* Anxiety
* Severe central nervous system (CNS) depression
* Respiratory depression
* Sleep apnea
* Allergic reactions

Note: This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Sodium oxybate is chemically related to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses in the brain.  It's believed to work by interacting with specific receptors in the brain, promoting relaxation and reducing the symptoms of narcolepsy.  The exact mechanism by which it improves cataplexy and EDS is still under investigation, but it's thought to influence the balance of neurotransmitters involved in sleep-wake regulation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Sodium oxybate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, those with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, those concurrently using sedative-hypnotic agents, and those consuming alcohol.
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with alcohol or other CNS depressants (sedatives, hypnotics) should be avoided due to the risk of additive CNS depression. Divalproex sodium can increase blood levels of sodium oxybate.
* **Warnings:** Sodium oxybate carries a boxed warning for CNS depression and the potential for abuse and misuse.  It should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, compromised respiratory function, heart failure, hypertension, or those sensitive to high sodium intake.  Elderly patients require close monitoring.  Pregnancy category C: Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed.  Excreted in breast milk, requiring careful consideration of the risks and benefits.
* **Other Warnings**: Patients should be aware of potential side effects like sleepwalking, hallucinations and altered mood, and advised to avoid hazardous activities after taking the medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time to notice improvement varies, but it usually takes several weeks of treatment for the full therapeutic benefit to be observed.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking sodium oxybate?** A: No, absolutely not. Combining sodium oxybate with alcohol significantly increases the risk of severe CNS depression and other dangerous side effects.

* **Q: How should I store sodium oxybate?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  Keep the bottle tightly closed.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the dose.  If you miss the second dose, skip it and resume the normal dosing schedule the following night.

* **Q: Can I stop taking sodium oxybate suddenly?** A: No, itâ€™s crucial to gradually reduce the dosage under your doctor's supervision to avoid potential withdrawal effects.
