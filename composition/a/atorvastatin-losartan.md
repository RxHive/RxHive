# Atorvastatin + Losartan

**Generic Name:** Atorvastatin/Losartan Potassium

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat patients with high blood pressure and high cholesterol (or high levels of fats in the blood) who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease.  The atorvastatin component lowers cholesterol and the losartan component lowers blood pressure.  It is typically prescribed when lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) alone are not enough to manage these conditions.  The doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual patient needs and response to the medication.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Atorvastatin/Losartan Potassium can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects can include:

* **Atorvastatin-related:** Muscle aches (myalgia), headache, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, rash, elevated liver enzymes (rarely serious liver damage).  Rare but serious side effects include rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).
* **Losartan-related:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection, cough.  Rare but serious side effects include angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), which requires immediate medical attention.

It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.  This list is not exhaustive, and individual experiences may vary.


**How it Works:**

* **Atorvastatin:** This is a statin drug.  It works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. By blocking this enzyme, atorvastatin lowers the production of LDL ("bad") cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing HDL ("good") cholesterol.

* **Losartan:** This is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).  Angiotensin II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, raising blood pressure. Losartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, allowing blood vessels to relax and widen, thus lowering blood pressure.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Atorvastatin/Losartan Potassium?**  A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can negatively impact liver health (relevant to atorvastatin) and blood pressure (relevant to losartan).
