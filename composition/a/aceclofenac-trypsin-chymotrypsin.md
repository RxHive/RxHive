**Note:**  The specific conditions this medication treats may vary depending on local regulations and prescribing physician guidelines. Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate usage.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person, but common ones associated with this combination include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia (indigestion), peptic ulcers (rare but serious).

* **Renal:**  Kidney problems (rare).

This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Trypsin Chymotrypsin:** These are proteolytic enzymes.  They help break down proteins, potentially reducing inflammation and swelling by assisting in the removal of damaged tissue and debris.  The exact mechanism of action in reducing pain is less well-understood than that of aceclofenac.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this medication safe for long-term use?**  A: No, long-term use of NSAIDs like aceclofenac increases the risk of serious side effects, particularly gastrointestinal problems and cardiovascular issues.  It should only be used for the duration recommended by your doctor.
* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Some medications, especially other NSAIDs, blood thinners, and certain heart medications, may interact negatively with aceclofenac.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is this medication suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  Generally, this medication is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Q:  Who shouldn't take this medication?** A:  Individuals with known allergies to aceclofenac, trypsin, chymotrypsin, or any of the other ingredients, those with severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcers, or bleeding disorders should generally avoid this medication.
