# Alcohol
### Generic Name
Alcohol (Ethanol)

### Usage
Alcohol, specifically ethanol, has several uses in medicine, though it's not typically prescribed as a standalone medication for treating a specific disease.  Its primary use is as a solvent and vehicle in many pharmaceutical preparations. This means it helps dissolve other medications and makes them easier to administer, either orally (in syrups or elixirs) or topically (in lotions or solutions).  It can also be used as an antiseptic, disinfecting skin before injections or minor procedures.  Historically, it had a role as a sedative or hypnotic, but this use is largely obsolete due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.

### Dosage
There's no standard "dosage" of alcohol as a medication because its use is highly context-dependent.  When used as a solvent or vehicle in pharmaceutical products, the amount of alcohol is determined by the formulation and intended use.  The concentration of alcohol in these products varies widely.  As an antiseptic, itâ€™s generally used in solutions at concentrations between 60% and 90% (70% isopropyl alcohol is common).  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided on the specific product label.  Never ingest alcohol intended for topical use.

### Side Effects
Side effects depend entirely on the context of alcohol use and the concentration.  When ingested, even small amounts can cause:

* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Impaired coordination
* Drowsiness
* Confusion

Higher amounts lead to more severe consequences, including alcohol poisoning.  Topical use may cause:

* Skin irritation
* Burning sensation
* Dryness

Serious side effects from topical use are rare, but allergic reactions are possible.  Always discontinue use and seek medical advice if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works
As a solvent, alcohol dissolves other substances, facilitating their absorption or application.  As an antiseptic, it denatures proteins in microbial cells, disrupting their structure and function, effectively killing or inhibiting their growth.  Its sedative effects, though rarely used clinically now, are believed to be due to its interaction with the central nervous system, depressing its activity.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, a severe condition with lifelong consequences for the child.  Breastfeeding mothers should avoid alcohol or consume it only minimally due to its transfer into breast milk.
* **Children:**  The use of products containing alcohol should be carefully monitored in children due to their higher susceptibility to the effects of alcohol.
* **Liver disease:**  Individuals with liver disease should exercise caution when using products containing alcohol, as it can further stress the liver.
* **Drug interactions:**  Alcohol can interact with many other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.  It's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Alcoholism:**  Individuals with alcohol dependence should avoid products containing alcohol.
* **Driving and operating machinery:**  Avoid driving or operating machinery after consuming any product containing alcohol.
