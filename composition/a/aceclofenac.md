# Aceclofenac
### Generic Name
Aceclofenac

### Usage

Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its main applications include managing acute pain from various sources such as low back pain, trauma, dental pain, gynecological pain, and conditions like scapulohumeral periarthritis (shoulder pain) and extra-articular rheumatism (pain and inflammation outside the joints).  Aceclofenac is also effective in managing the pain and inflammation associated with chronic conditions like ankylosing spondylitis (a type of arthritis affecting the spine), osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease), and rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune disease causing joint inflammation).

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the condition's severity and the specific formulation (immediate-release or sustained-release tablets).

* **Acute pain/inflammation, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis:**
    * Immediate-release tablets: Typically 100 mg twice daily (BID).
    * Sustained-release tablets: Usually 200 mg once daily (OD).

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of aceclofenac in children have not been established, and it's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney or liver impairment significantly impacts how the body processes aceclofenac.  Consult a doctor for guidance on dosage adjustments, as these are not standardized across manufacturers and some contraindicate use in severe cases. For mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment, cautious use may be considered, but  severe impairment usually necessitates avoidance.  Kidney function should be monitored closely when using aceclofenac, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney issues.  The KDIGO 2012 guidelines for NSAIDs provide further recommendations.

**Administration:**  Aceclofenac tablets should be swallowed whole with or after food to minimize stomach upset. Do not crush or chew the tablets.

### How it Works

Aceclofenac belongs to a group of medicines called NSAIDs. It works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By blocking COX enzymes, aceclofenac reduces the production of prostaglandins, thus alleviating pain and inflammation.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Aceclofenac is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Allergy to aceclofenac or other NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen)
* History of peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding
* Severe kidney or liver impairment
* Active bleeding or bleeding disorders
* Third trimester of pregnancy
* Breastfeeding (due to unknown excretion in breast milk)
* Certain cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases (e.g., heart failure, ischemic heart disease)
* Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis)
* Children under 12 years old


**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events (blood clots), gastrointestinal problems, and other adverse effects.
*  Use cautiously in patients with mild-to-moderate kidney or liver impairment.
*  May increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants or other blood-thinning medications.
*  Patients with a history of asthma should use with caution.
* May cause drowsiness or dizziness; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
*  Should be used with caution in elderly patients.
* Women of reproductive age should consider discontinuation if trying to conceive.


**Drug Interactions:** Aceclofenac can interact with numerous other medications, including but not limited to, other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, blood thinners, diuretics, lithium, and certain medications used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
