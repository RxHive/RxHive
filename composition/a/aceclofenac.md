# Aceclofenac

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac

**Usage:** Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis:  Pain and inflammation in the joints.
* Rheumatoid arthritis:  A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.
* Ankylosing spondylitis:  A type of arthritis affecting the spine.
* Acute pain:  Short-term pain from injuries or surgery (often used post-operatively).
* Post-operative pain: Pain following surgical procedures.
* Dental pain: Pain associated with dental procedures.
* Menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) : Pain associated with menstruation.
  *(Note:  Aceclofenac is not a first-line treatment for all these conditions and its use should be guided by a doctor.)*


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, aceclofenac can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can range from mild to severe and include:

* **Common (affecting more than 1 in 100 people):**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, headache, dizziness.
* **Less Common (affecting 1 to 10 in 1000 people):**  Heartburn, bloating, flatulence, drowsiness, insomnia, rash, itching.
* **Rare (affecting less than 1 in 1000 people):**  Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, shortness of breath, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis),  liver problems, kidney problems, increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use or high doses), gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.


**How it Works:** Aceclofenac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac helps to alleviate pain and inflammation.
