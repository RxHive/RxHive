# Aminohippurate Sodium
### Generic Name
Aminohippurate Sodium

### Usage
Aminohippurate sodium is a diagnostic agent primarily used to assess and measure renal function.  Specifically, it helps determine effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and the tubular maximum for PAH (TmPAH), which are crucial indicators of kidney function.  These measurements are important in diagnosing and monitoring various kidney diseases.  It's not used to treat kidney conditions directly, but rather to provide information about their severity and progression.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (for renal function diagnostics):**

* **Intravenous (IV) Administration:** A loading dose of 6-10 mg/kg is administered, infused at a rate of 10-24 mg/min.  The goal is to maintain a plasma concentration of 2 mg/dL.  Precise infusion rates are determined based on individual patient factors and monitoring of plasma concentrations.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of aminohippurate sodium in children have not been established.  It's not typically used in pediatric populations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Careful monitoring is crucial in patients with these conditions, as their ability to metabolize and excrete the drug may be altered.

### Side Effects
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions):  These can range from mild (flushing, tingling, warmth sensation) to severe (anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria).
* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal cramps
* Urge to urinate or defecate
* Vasomotor disturbances


While less common, serious hypersensitivity reactions are possible and require immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Aminohippurate sodium is filtered by the glomeruli (the filtering units of the kidneys) and then undergoes almost complete secretion by the proximal tubules of the nephrons (the functional units of the kidneys).  By measuring the amount of aminohippurate sodium excreted in the urine, clinicians can estimate the rate of blood flow through the kidneys (ERPF) and the capacity of the renal tubules to secrete substances (TmPAH).  These measurements provide valuable insights into kidney function.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Aminohippurate sodium is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or any of its components.
* **Hypersensitivity:** There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild to severe. Patients with a history of allergies should be monitored carefully.
* **Cardiac Issues:** Caution is needed in patients with low cardiac reserve (reduced ability of the heart to pump blood), as the drug's effects on blood flow should be carefully considered.
* **Latex Sensitivity:**  Aminohippurate sodium solutions may contain latex; thus, it should be used cautiously in patients with latex allergies.
* **Pregnancy & Lactation:** Aminohippurate sodium is categorized as pregnancy category C (potential risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out). Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risks. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised if used during breastfeeding.


### FAQs
* **Q: How is aminohippurate sodium administered?**
    * A: It's administered intravenously (IV) only, usually as a slow infusion to maintain a stable plasma concentration.

* **Q: What are the possible side effects?**
    * A: Side effects can range from mild (flushing, nausea) to severe (anaphylaxis). Any unusual symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider.

* **Q: How is it stored?**
    * A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions, typically refrigeration is recommended.

* **Q: Can I use aminohippurate sodium if I have kidney disease?**
    * A: While used to assess kidney function, itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional.  They will determine if this test is appropriate given your condition.

* **Q:  Is this drug used to *treat* kidney disease?**
    * A: No. It's a diagnostic agent, used to measure kidney function, not to treat kidney diseases.
