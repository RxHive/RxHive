# Aripiprazole Lauroxil
### Generic Name
Aripiprazole Lauroxil

### Usage
Aripiprazole lauroxil is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia in adults.  It's administered as a long-acting injectable (LAI) formulation, meaning it provides sustained release of the active ingredient, aripiprazole, over a period of time, reducing the need for daily oral medication.  The 675mg strength is specifically designed for initial dosing or restarting treatment after a missed dose, used in conjunction with oral aripiprazole. It is not intended for repeated administration.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage for Schizophrenia:** Aripiprazole lauroxil is a prodrug that converts to aripiprazole.  Dosage is individualized and depends on the patient's current oral aripiprazole dose and tolerability.  It is administered intramuscularly (IM) by a healthcare professional.  There are two common approaches to initiation:

* **1-Day Oral Overlap:** A single oral dose of aripiprazole (30mg) is given alongside a single 675mg dose of the nanocrystal dispersion of aripiprazole lauroxil. The first dose of the regular aripiprazole lauroxil injection then follows, depending on the patient's previous oral aripiprazole dose, within or up to 10 days.


* **21-Day Oral Overlap:** Oral aripiprazole is given for 21 days concurrently with the initial aripiprazole lauroxil injection.  The initial IM aripiprazole lauroxil dose is determined based on the patient's current oral aripiprazole dose (see conversion table below).  This approach ensures a smoother transition and improved tolerability.

**Conversion of Oral Aripiprazole to IM Aripiprazole Lauroxil:**

* Oral Aripiprazole 10 mg/day: Initial IM Aripiprazole lauroxil dose of 441 mg per month
* Oral Aripiprazole 15 mg/day: Initial IM Aripiprazole lauroxil dose of 662 mg per month, 882 mg every 6 weeks, or 1064 mg every 2 months.
* Oral Aripiprazole ≥20 mg/day: Initial IM Aripiprazole lauroxil dose of 882 mg per month


Subsequent doses of Aripiprazole lauroxil are adjusted based on individual needs and response, ensuring at least a 14-day interval between injections.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of aripiprazole lauroxil in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment. However, close monitoring is recommended.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (≥1%):**

* Nervous system: Akathisia, dystonia, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), headache, insomnia, parkinsonism, restlessness
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Weight gain
* Local: Injection site reaction (pain, erythema, swelling, induration)
* Neuromuscular & Skeletal: Increased creatine phosphokinase levels


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)
* Tardive dyskinesia
* Orthostatic hypotension
*  Impulse control disorders (compulsive shopping, gambling, binge eating, hypersexuality)


If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Aripiprazole lauroxil is a prodrug;  after intramuscular injection, it's converted into aripiprazole, the active ingredient. Aripiprazole's exact mechanism in treating schizophrenia isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to work by influencing dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.  It acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors. This balanced modulation of neurotransmitter activity helps to alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to aripiprazole or any formulation component.
* **Warnings:** Increased mortality risk in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (not approved for this use). Increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, weight gain, orthostatic hypotension, leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, seizures, cognitive and motor impairment, and suicidal tendencies (especially in children).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Aripiprazole metabolism can be affected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) and inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin), and strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine).  Concomitant use with antihypertensive drugs may enhance hypotensive effects, and with benzodiazepines may increase sedation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Aripiprazole lauroxil is categorized as pregnancy Category C. Neonates exposed during the third trimester may experience extrapyramidal or withdrawal symptoms after birth.  Aripiprazole is excreted in breast milk; careful consideration of risks and benefits is necessary.
