# Attapulgite
### Generic Name
Attapulgite

### Usage
Attapulgite is primarily used to treat diarrhea and associated cramping.  It works by absorbing excess fluid in the intestines, thus helping to solidify loose stools.  This makes it effective in relieving the symptoms of acute, non-infectious diarrhea.  It is not typically used for chronic diarrhea or diarrhea caused by infection.


### Dosage

**Adults:** For diarrhea, the oral dosage is 1.2-1.5 grams after each loose bowel movement.  The maximum daily dose is 8.4 grams.  Attapulgite should not be used for more than two days.

**Children:**  Dosage varies by age:

* **Ages 3-6 years:** 300 mg after each loose bowel movement, with a maximum daily dose of 2.1 grams.  Use for no more than two days.
* **Ages 6-12 years:** 600-750 mg after each loose bowel movement, with a maximum daily dose of 4.5 grams.
* **Ages >12 years:**  The dosage is the same as for adults (1.2-1.5 grams after each loose bowel movement, up to 8.4 grams daily, for a maximum of two days).

**Note:** Attapulgite is generally not recommended for children under 3 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects, though the frequency is not precisely defined, may include:

* Bloating
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Flatulence (gas)
* Mild constipation
* Nausea

While less common, more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Attapulgite is a clay-like substance that acts as an absorbent.  It works by binding to excess water and other substances in the intestines, reducing the fluidity of the stool and helping to relieve diarrhea.  This is a purely physical mechanism; it does not affect the underlying cause of diarrhea.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Attapulgite should not be used in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to attapulgite or any formulation component.
* Bowel obstruction.
* High fever (as this may indicate infectious diarrhea, requiring different treatment).
* Dysentery.
* Blood in the stool (indicating a possible serious condition).
* Bleeding ulcers.
* Gout.
* Hemophilia.
* Other hemorrhagic conditions.

**Cautions:**  Use with caution in elderly patients and those with diabetes.


**Drug Interactions:** Because attapulgite is highly absorbent, it can potentially interfere with the absorption of other medications taken concurrently. It's advisable to take attapulgite at least 2-3 hours before or after other medications.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Attapulgite is not absorbed systemically, therefore posing minimal risk during pregnancy or breastfeeding. However, it is always best to consult a healthcare professional before using any medication during these periods.
