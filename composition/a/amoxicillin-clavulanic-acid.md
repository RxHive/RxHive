# Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid
### Generic Name
Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid

### Usage

Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that works by killing bacteria, while clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that prevents certain bacteria from inactivating amoxicillin. This combination broadens the effectiveness against bacteria resistant to amoxicillin alone.

Primary uses include treating infections of the:

* **Ears:** Acute otitis media (middle ear infection)
* **Respiratory system:**  Lower respiratory tract infections (like pneumonia and bronchitis), acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (sinus infection)
* **Skin and soft tissues:**  Skin and skin-structure infections (such as cellulitis and impetigo)
* **Urinary tract:** Urinary tract infections (UTIs)


Secondary or off-label uses (meaning these uses are not officially approved but are sometimes prescribed by doctors) may include treating infections of the:

* Mouth (odontogenic infections)
* Abdomen (intra-abdominal infections, such as diverticulitis)
* Diabetic foot
* Bite wounds (animal or human)
*  As prophylaxis (prevention) for surgical infections.  This is often given intravenously before surgery.


It's crucial to remember that this medication only works against bacterial infections; it's ineffective against viral infections (like the common cold or flu).  Always consult a doctor to determine the cause of an infection before starting any antibiotic treatment.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the infection.  The following is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.

**Adults:**  Dosage forms include oral tablets (immediate-release and extended-release) and intravenous (IV) injection. Dosages range from 250mg to 875mg of amoxicillin combined with varying amounts of clavulanic acid, taken every 8 or 12 hours, or administered intravenously depending on the severity and type of infection.  Specific dosages for various infections are extensive and depend on factors like comorbidities and response to therapy.  Refer to a physician or pharmacist for precise instructions.

**Children:** Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day) and are significantly different from adult doses.  Liquid suspension formulations are commonly used for children. Again, a physician will determine the correct dose for a child based on their weight and the type of infection.  Dosages will also vary based on the specific formulation of Amoxicillin/Clavulanate (e.g., 4:1, 7:1, 14:1 ratios of Amoxicillin to Clavulanate).

**Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary for individuals with kidney or liver problems.  These adjustments must be made by a healthcare professional to avoid adverse reactions.


**Administration:** Oral forms should be taken as directed, with or without food, though taking it with food can help reduce stomach upset. IV administration should only be done by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):

* Diarrhea

Less common, but still possible side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash (including diaper rash)
* Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)
* Loose stools


Serious but less common side effects (less than 1%, often from post-marketing surveillance):

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis â€“ a severe, life-threatening reaction)
* Liver problems (hepatitis, jaundice, increased liver enzymes)
*  Blood disorders (e.g., prolonged prothrombin time)


If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Amoxicillin works by disrupting the bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Bacteria need a strong cell wall to survive; amoxicillin interferes with this process, weakening the cell wall and causing the bacteria to die.

Clavulanic acid acts as a protective shield for amoxicillin.  Some bacteria produce an enzyme called beta-lactamase that can break down and inactivate amoxicillin. Clavulanic acid inhibits this enzyme, allowing amoxicillin to work effectively even against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics.  A history of allergic reactions to amoxicillin or clavulanic acid is also a contraindication.
* **Liver disease:** Use with caution in patients with liver problems.  Amoxicillin/clavulanate can cause liver damage, which is more likely in those with pre-existing liver conditions.
* **Kidney disease:** Dosage adjustments are required for patients with kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe during pregnancy (Category B), consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. The drug is excreted in breast milk.
* **Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, including oral contraceptives.  Inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Superinfections:**  Prolonged use can lead to the overgrowth of other organisms, causing secondary infections.
* **<em>C. difficile</em>-associated diarrhea:** This serious side effect may occur during or after treatment with antibiotics.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid with food?**

A: Yes, taking it with food can help reduce stomach upset.

**Q: How should I store Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid?**

A: Store it according to the label instructions, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.  Liquid suspensions should be shaken well before each dose.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.


**Q:  How long does it take to work?**

A: You may start to feel better within a few days, but you should complete the entire course of treatment, even if you feel better sooner, to prevent the infection from returning.

**Q: Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking this medication?**

A: While there is no direct contraindication, excessive alcohol consumption can negatively impact liver function. It's best to consult with your doctor or pharmacist about alcohol intake while on this antibiotic.
