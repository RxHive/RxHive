# Ampicillin + Probenecid
### Generic Name
Ampicillin/Probenecid Combination

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial infections, particularly those caused by susceptible strains of bacteria.  Ampicillin is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic that works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. Probenecid is added to this combination to enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin. It does this by blocking the kidneys' reabsorption of ampicillin, thereby increasing the concentration of ampicillin in the blood and extending its duration of action.  This makes the treatment more effective against the infection.  While the primary use is for bacterial infections, specific indications often involve urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible bacteria.  The choice of this combination is often dictated by the severity and type of infection, as determined by a doctor.


### Dosage
Dosage for ampicillin/probenecid combination is determined by a healthcare professional and varies depending on the individual's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific strain of bacteria involved.  There isn't a standardized "over-the-counter" dosage.

* **Oral Administration (typical, but always follow prescription):**  A common regimen involves a single dose of ampicillin and probenecid administered together.  The exact amounts of each will be specified in the prescription.  The frequency of dosing will also be determined by the doctor, it is commonly once or twice daily, depending on the severity.
* **Intravenous (IV) Administration:** IV administration of ampicillin is possible, although it is usually given separately from probenecid.  The probenecid may be given orally alongside the IV ampicillin. Dosages for IV ampicillin are calculated based on weight and the type of infection and are only administered under direct medical supervision.  Never attempt IV administration without proper medical training and a prescription.
* **Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is always adjusted based on weight and is significantly lower than that of adults.  It's crucial to strictly follow the prescribed dosage for children, which will be determined by a pediatrician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of ampicillin include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Rash

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Seizures (particularly in individuals with impaired kidney function)
* Blood disorders
* Pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection)


Probenecid's side effects can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ampicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  Bacteria require a properly formed cell wall to survive. By interfering with this process, ampicillin effectively stops the growth and replication of bacteria, allowing the body's immune system to eliminate the infection.  Probenecid, on the other hand, inhibits the tubular secretion of ampicillin in the kidneys. This means that less ampicillin is eliminated through the urine, resulting in higher and more prolonged blood levels of the antibiotic. This enhanced blood concentration allows the ampicillin to be more effective against the infection.

### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics should avoid this combination.  
* **Kidney problems:** This combination should be used cautiously in patients with kidney impairment, as both ampicillin and probenecid are excreted by the kidneys. Dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Liver problems:** Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of ampicillin/probenecid during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful evaluation of the risks and benefits by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:** This combination can interact with other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), methotrexate, and certain diuretics. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ampicillin/probenecid with alcohol?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication, as alcohol can exacerbate some side effects like nausea and stomach upset.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q: How should I store ampicillin/probenecid?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure.
* **Q: Can I stop taking the medication when I feel better?** A: No, it is crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better before the course is finished.  Stopping early can lead to incomplete treatment and the potential for recurrence of the infection, and the development of antibiotic resistance.
