# Ambroxol + Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Guaifenesin + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylephrine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  The specific symptoms it targets include:

* **Cough:** Ambroxol and Guaifenesin work together to loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.  Ambroxol stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs, while Guaifenesin is an expectorant.
* **Runny nose/Congestion:** Phenylephrine is a decongestant that helps shrink swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Sneezing/Itching:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an antihistamine that helps reduce allergy-like symptoms such as sneezing, itchy eyes and nose, and runny nose.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage, but common ones include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a frequent side effect, particularly from the antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate).
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines and decongestants.
* **Nausea:**  Possible, especially with higher doses.
* **Headache:** Can occur.
* **Dizziness:**  Another common side effect.
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):** More likely with higher doses of phenylephrine.
* **Increased blood pressure:**  Possible with phenylephrine.
* **Constipation:** Possible.
* **Allergic reactions:**  While rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through a multi-pronged approach:

* **Ambroxol:**  A mucolytic agent that thins mucus and makes it easier to expectorate.  It also has some mild anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that helps loosen and thin mucus, facilitating its removal from the respiratory tract.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergy-like symptoms.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
