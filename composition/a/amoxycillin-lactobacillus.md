# Amoxycillin + Lactobacillus

**Generic Name:** Amoxicillin + Lactobacillus (various brand names exist, combining amoxicillin with different Lactobacillus strains)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat bacterial infections while simultaneously attempting to prevent or reduce the gastrointestinal side effects often associated with amoxicillin.  Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic effective against a wide range of bacteria. Lactobacillus is a type of probiotic bacteria that helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome.  It is commonly prescribed for infections such as:

* Ear infections (otitis media)
* Respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia - only when amoxicillin is appropriate)
* Skin infections
* Urinary tract infections (UTIs)


**Side Effects:**

* **Amoxicillin Side Effects:**  These are common and can include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, itching, and yeast infections (thrush).  More serious, though less common, side effects can include allergic reactions (ranging from mild hives to severe anaphylaxis), and changes in blood counts.
* **Lactobacillus Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated.  However, some individuals may experience mild gas or bloating.  Rarely, allergic reactions can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Amoxicillin:**  Amoxicillin works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria. It does this by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls. This ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.
* **Lactobacillus:**  Lactobacillus strains are probiotics that help restore or maintain the balance of good bacteria in the gut.  Amoxicillin can disrupt this balance, leading to diarrhea and other digestive issues.  The addition of Lactobacillus aims to counteract this disruption, reducing the incidence and severity of such side effects.  It does this by competing with harmful bacteria for resources and producing substances that inhibit their growth.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this combination always necessary?** A: No.  The addition of Lactobacillus is primarily to help mitigate the side effects of amoxicillin.  Your doctor will determine if the benefits of adding the probiotic outweigh the potential costs.  In some cases, amoxicillin alone may be sufficient.
* **Q: Are there different strains of Lactobacillus used?** A: Yes, various Lactobacillus strains (e.g., *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*, *Lactobacillus acidophilus*) may be combined with amoxicillin. The specific strain used can vary depending on the product.
* **Q: Can I take this medication if I am allergic to penicillin?** A: No. If you have a penicillin allergy, you should not take amoxicillin.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions (such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or severe rash) or any other concerning side effects.
* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking before starting this combination therapy.  Interactions may occur.
* **Q:  How long should I take this medication?** A: Follow your doctor's instructions carefully regarding the duration of treatment.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.
