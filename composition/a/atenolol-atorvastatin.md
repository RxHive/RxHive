# Atenolol + Atorvastatin

**Generic Name:** Atenolol and Atorvastatin

**Usage:** This combination is not a standard, pre-made pharmaceutical product.  Atenolol and Atorvastatin are prescribed *separately* to treat different conditions.  A doctor *might* prescribe them together if a patient needs treatment for both high blood pressure (hypertension) and high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia).  This would be a case of *concurrent* medication, not a single drug.

* **Atenolol:**  Used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina (chest pain).  It may also be used to prevent migraine headaches and to treat certain types of heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).

* **Atorvastatin:** Used to lower levels of "bad" cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) and triglycerides in the blood, and to raise levels of "good" cholesterol (HDL cholesterol). It's used to prevent cardiovascular disease and heart attacks in people at high risk.


**Side Effects:** The side effects listed below are for *each drug individually*.  The combination could potentially lead to more or different side effects.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.

* **Atenolol:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, cold hands and feet, slow heart rate (bradycardia), shortness of breath.  Rarely, more serious side effects can occur.

* **Atorvastatin:** Headache, muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea. Rarely, more serious side effects including liver damage, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), and allergic reactions can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Atenolol:**  A beta-blocker, atenolol works by blocking the effects of adrenaline on the heart and blood vessels, causing the heart to beat slower and with less force, thus lowering blood pressure.

* **Atorvastatin:** A statin, atorvastatin inhibits an enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) in the liver that is crucial for cholesterol production. By inhibiting this enzyme, the liver produces less cholesterol, and more LDL cholesterol is removed from the bloodstream.
