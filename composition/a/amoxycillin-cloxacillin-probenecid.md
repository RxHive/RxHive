# Amoxycillin + Cloxacillin + Probenecid
### Generic Name
Amoxycillin + Cloxacillin + Probenecid

**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-formulated generic medication.  Amoxicillin and cloxacillin are often prescribed together, sometimes with probenecid, but it's usually done as a compounded prescription (mixed by a pharmacist based on a doctor's specific order) to address a particular patient's needs.  Therefore, information on dosage and specific side effects will be less precise than for a commercially available single-entity drug. Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.


### Usage

This combination therapy is primarily used to treat serious bacterial infections where a broad-spectrum approach is needed.  Amoxicillin is a penicillin-like antibiotic effective against a wide range of gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria. Cloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, meaning it's effective against bacteria that produce an enzyme (penicillinase) which deactivates many penicillins.  Combining them provides coverage against a broader spectrum of bacteria than either drug alone. Probenecid is added to enhance the effectiveness of the antibiotics by reducing their excretion from the body, thereby leading to higher and more sustained blood levels.

The specific infections this combination might treat include severe skin infections, deep-seated infections, and infections in individuals with penicillinase-producing bacteria.  The physician will determine the suitability of this regimen based on the specific bacteria identified (via culture and sensitivity testing) and the patient's overall health.


### Dosage

**Dosage is entirely dependent on the prescribing physician and the patient's individual needs. There is no standard, pre-defined dosage for this combination.**  The amounts of amoxicillin, cloxacillin, and probenecid will be determined based on factors such as the severity of the infection, the patient's weight, age, kidney function, and the specific bacteria involved.  The medication is usually administered orally in tablet or capsule form.


### Side Effects

The side effects of this combination therapy are largely derived from the individual components.  Common side effects might include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives (in some cases, severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis can occur â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this happens)
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Increased risk of bleeding** (especially with prolonged use)
* **Kidney problems** (more likely with probenecid, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney conditions)
* **Yeast infections** (due to the disruption of normal gut flora)


This is not an exhaustive list.  Other less common side effects are possible.  It is crucial to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to your doctor.


### How it Works

Amoxicillin and cloxacillin work by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  This disrupts the integrity of the bacterial cell, leading to bacterial cell death. Cloxacillin's resistance to penicillinase allows it to work against bacteria that can inactivate amoxicillin. Probenecid blocks the renal tubular secretion of both amoxicillin and cloxacillin, thereby increasing their serum concentrations and extending their duration of action.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** This combination is contraindicated in patients with known allergies to penicillins or cephalosporins (these antibiotics are related).
* **Kidney disease:**  Probenecid can impair kidney function, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney problems.  Close monitoring is required.
* **Liver disease:**  Amoxicillin and cloxacillin are metabolized by the liver; patients with liver impairment may require dose adjustments.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  A physician should be consulted.
* **Interactions:**  This combination can interact with other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), methotrexate, and certain oral contraceptives.  Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** While there's no direct contraindication, excessive alcohol consumption can worsen gastrointestinal side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this combination with other antibiotics?** A:  No, generally not without consulting your doctor. Interactions with other antibiotics can occur, potentially reducing efficacy or increasing side effects.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  Store as directed by your pharmacist. This usually involves keeping it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on the severity and type of infection. Your doctor will determine the appropriate course of treatment.  Complete the entire course, even if you start feeling better, to prevent the infection from recurring.
