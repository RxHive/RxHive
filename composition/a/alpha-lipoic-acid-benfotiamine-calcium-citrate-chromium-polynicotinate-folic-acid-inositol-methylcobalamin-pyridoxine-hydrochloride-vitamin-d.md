## Alpha Lipoic Acid + Benfotiamine + Calcium Citrate + Chromium Polynicotinate + Folic Acid + Inositol + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Vitamin D

This combination represents a multi-vitamin and mineral supplement designed to support various metabolic processes, particularly those related to nerve function, glucose metabolism, and overall health.  It's crucial to understand that this is a *generic* combination, and specific formulations will vary in dosages and inactive ingredients.  Always consult the product's label for precise information.

**Generic Name:**  This is not a single generic name, but rather a combination of several: Alpha-lipoic acid, Benfotiamine, Calcium Citrate, Chromium Polynicotinate, Folic Acid (Vitamin B9), Inositol, Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12), Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), and Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3).

**Usage:** This combination is often marketed for individuals seeking support in the following areas:

* **Nerve Health:** Alpha-lipoic acid, benfotiamine, methylcobalamin, and pyridoxine are all involved in nerve function and may help alleviate symptoms of neuropathy.
* **Metabolic Health:**  Alpha-lipoic acid, benfotiamine, chromium, and inositol can play roles in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.
* **Cognitive Function:** Some components like methylcobalamin and inositol are linked to cognitive health.
* **Bone Health:** Vitamin D and calcium are essential for bone health and strength.


**Specific uses should be discussed with a healthcare professional. This is not a substitute for medical treatment.**

**Side Effects:** Side effects vary depending on the individual and the dosage of each component. Potential side effects include:

* **Alpha-lipoic acid:** Mild nausea, skin rash, low blood sugar.
* **Benfotiamine:** Generally well-tolerated, but potential for some gastrointestinal upset.
* **Calcium Citrate:** Constipation, bloating, kidney stones (especially with pre-existing conditions).
* **Chromium Polynicotinate:**  Generally well-tolerated, but potential for mild gastrointestinal upset.
* **Folic Acid:**  Generally safe, but high doses may mask vitamin B12 deficiency.
* **Inositol:** Usually well-tolerated, but potential for mild gastrointestinal issues.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Generally safe, but rarely can cause nausea or diarrhea.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride:** High doses may cause nerve damage.
* **Vitamin D:**  High doses can lead to hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in the blood).

**How it Works:** Each component in this combination works through different mechanisms:

* **Alpha-lipoic acid:** Antioxidant and improves insulin sensitivity.
* **Benfotiamine:** Lipid-soluble form of vitamin B1, improving glucose metabolism.
* **Calcium Citrate:** Essential for bone health and various bodily functions.
* **Chromium Polynicotinate:** Enhances insulin action.
* **Folic Acid:** Crucial for cell growth and DNA synthesis.
* **Inositol:** Involved in cell signaling and may improve insulin sensitivity.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Active form of vitamin B12, essential for nerve function and cell metabolism.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride:**  Coenzyme involved in many metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis.
* **Vitamin D:** Regulates calcium absorption and bone health, also involved in immune function.
