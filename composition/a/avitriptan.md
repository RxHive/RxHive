# Avitriptan
### Generic Name
Avitriptan

### Usage
Avitriptan was a drug investigated for the treatment of migraine headaches.  It was designed to work as a triptan, a class of medications specifically targeting migraine pain. While it showed promise in early clinical trials in reducing migraine symptoms, it was never approved for market release due to concerns about potential adverse effects on the coronary system (heart).  Therefore, its usage is purely historical, as it's not currently available for prescription.

### Dosage
Since avitriptan never received market approval, there are no officially established dosage recommendations for adults or children.  The dosages explored during clinical trials varied, but this information is not readily accessible to the public and shouldn't be used for self-medication.  It's crucial to remember that attempting to use avitriptan based on incomplete or outdated information is unsafe.

### Side Effects
As avitriptan's clinical trials were incomplete, a complete profile of side effects isn't definitively established. However, concerns about potential coronary adverse effects were a significant factor in halting its development.  Other side effects might have included those commonly seen with other triptans, such as nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness.  However, this is speculative and should not be taken as a definitive list.

### How it Works
Avitriptan was intended to function as a selective serotonin receptor agonist, primarily targeting 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors in the brain.  Activating these receptors is believed to help reduce the pain and other symptoms associated with migraine attacks by constricting blood vessels and inhibiting the release of pain-inducing substances. The exact mechanisms through which avitriptan would achieve this are similar to other triptans, although its specific profile wasn't fully elucidated due to the discontinuation of its development.

### Precautions
Because avitriptan was never approved for use, there are no official precautions. However, given that it was a triptan, potential precautions would likely have included warnings for individuals with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or other cardiovascular conditions.  Additionally, precautions regarding pregnancy, breastfeeding, and interactions with other medications would have been necessary, although the specifics are unknown.
