# Amdinocillin
### Generic Name
Amdinocillin

### Usage

Amdinocillin, also known as pivmecillinam, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic primarily used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs).  Specifically, it's effective against acute uncomplicated cystitis (bladder infection) and recurrent UTIs caused by susceptible bacteria like *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Enterobacter*, and *Proteus* species.  While its primary use is in UTIs, it has also shown some efficacy in treating salmonellosis (Salmonella infection), though this is less common.  It's crucial to remember that Amdinocillin's effectiveness depends on the bacteria's susceptibility to the drug.  A culture and sensitivity test should ideally be performed before treatment to confirm susceptibility.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  For UTIs, the typical oral dosage is 400 mg twice or three times daily for 3-7 days for acute uncomplicated cystitis. For recurrent UTIs, the dose might be adjusted to 200-400 mg three or four times daily until urine cultures show no bacteria.  For salmonellosis, the daily oral dose may range from 1.2 to 2.4 grams, divided into appropriate administrations.

**Children (aged >6 years and weighing >40 kg):**  For UTIs, the oral dosage is 20-40 mg/kg/day divided into three doses for 3-7 days, with a maximum daily dose of 1200 mg.  Amdinocillin is not typically recommended for children under 6 years or weighing less than 40kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is usually needed for patients with hepatic impairment. However, dose reduction is recommended for patients with renal impairment, proportional to the degree of kidney function loss. Close monitoring, including plasma level monitoring, may be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection)

**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Abdominal pain
* Abnormal liver function test results
* Acute porphyria (in susceptible individuals)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* *Clostridioides difficile* colitis (severe bowel inflammation)
* Decreased plasma carnitine concentrations
* Dizziness
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Erythematous rash (red rash)
* Esophageal ulcer/esophagitis (esophagus inflammation or ulcer)
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Macular eruption (rash with small spots)
* Maculopapular rash (raised, red rash)
* Oral mucosa ulcer (ulcers in the mouth)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Vomiting

If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works

Amdinocillin is a prodrug; meaning it's converted in the body to its active form, mecillinam. Mecillinam inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding specifically to penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2).  PBP2 is crucial for bacterial cell wall elongation. By blocking PBP2, mecillinam prevents the bacteria from building and maintaining their cell walls, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death (bactericidal action).  Amdinocillin is particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria.

### Precautions

Amdinocillin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to penicillins, cephalosporins, or any component of the formulation; those with impaired esophageal transit (difficulty swallowing); and those with genetic metabolic disorders causing severe carnitine deficiency.  It should be used cautiously in patients with renal impairment and those with porphyria.

Amdinocillin can interact with several other medications.  These interactions can affect the levels or effectiveness of Amdinocillin or the other medication. Examples include interactions with acemetacin, aminoglycosides, BCG, erythromycin, methotrexate, probenecid, tetracyclines, valproate, and vitamin K antagonists.  Discuss all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements) you are taking with your doctor before starting Amdinocillin.

During pregnancy and breastfeeding,  while Amdinocillin *can* be used for UTIs when clinically necessary,  other antibiotics are sometimes preferred due to potential adverse effects.  Consult your doctor for advice.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Amdinocillin with food?** A: Amdinocillin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store Amdinocillin?** A: Store Amdinocillin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is Amdinocillin safe for everyone?** A: Amdinocillin is generally safe when used as directed, but it's not suitable for everyone. Consult your doctor to determine if it's right for you.  Certain groups (e.g., children under 6 years, patients with renal impairment) require special considerations.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Amdinocillin early if I feel better?** A:  No, complete the prescribed course of treatment even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and potential complications.
