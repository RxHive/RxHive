# Abametapir
### Generic Name
Abametapir

### Usage
Abametapir is a topical medication used to treat head lice infestations in individuals aged 6 months and older.  It's a pediculicide, meaning it kills lice.  This is its primary and currently only approved use.

### Dosage
**Head Lice Infestation:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥6 months:**  Apply a sufficient amount of abametapir lotion (up to the full content of one bottle) to dry hair, ensuring complete coverage of the hair and scalp. Gently massage the lotion into the scalp and hair. Leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing thoroughly with warm water.  Hair may be shampooed after the treatment.  A single application is typically sufficient.

* **Children <6 months:** The safety and effectiveness of abametapir have not been established in this age group.  Do not use in children under 6 months old.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to the manufacturer's labeling.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of users) may include:

* Scalp erythema (redness) and edema (swelling)
* Scalp rash
* Skin burning sensation
* Contact dermatitis
* Scalp itching (pruritus)
* Vomiting
* Eye irritation
* Hair color changes

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Abametapir is a metalloproteinase inhibitor.  Metalloproteinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in the development and survival of lice eggs. By inhibiting these enzymes, abametapir disrupts the life cycle of lice, leading to their death and the elimination of the infestation.

### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  There's limited data on abametapir use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult your healthcare provider before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Accidental Ingestion:** Abametapir is for topical use only. Keep it out of reach of children and avoid contact with eyes.  Wash hands thoroughly after application.
* **Drug Interactions:** Abametapir may interact with medications metabolized by certain liver enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2). Discuss any other medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before using abametapir.
* **Neonatal Risks:**  In neonates, there is a potential increased risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity, gasping syndrome, and low birth weight; therefore, cautious use is warranted.
* **General:** Do not reuse leftover medication. Properly dispose of any unused portion according to local guidelines.

### FAQs

It should not be used in children younger than 6 months.
