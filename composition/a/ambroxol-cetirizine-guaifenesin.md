# Ambroxol + Cetirizine + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Cetirizine + Guaifenesin (Note: This combination may not be available under a single generic name in all regions.  It's often found as a branded product combining these three active ingredients.)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  Specifically, it targets:

* **Cough:** Guaifenesin acts as an expectorant, thinning and loosening mucus in the airways to make it easier to cough up.  Ambroxol also helps to thin mucus, and may have some mild cough suppressant effects.
* **Runny Nose/Sneezing:** Cetirizine is an antihistamine that helps to reduce nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing associated with allergies or common cold symptoms.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific dosages of each ingredient. Common side effects may include:

* **Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset. Rarely, allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, swelling).
* **Cetirizine:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness.  In rare cases, more serious reactions can occur.
* **Guaifenesin:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, headache, dizziness.


It is important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and more serious side effects are possible, though less common.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Ambroxol:** This mucolytic agent increases the production of surfactant in the lungs, helping to thin and loosen mucus. It's believed to also have some direct effects on the cough reflex.
* **Cetirizine:** This second-generation antihistamine competitively blocks histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine release that causes allergic symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itching.
* **Guaifenesin:** This expectorant works by increasing the fluid content of respiratory tract secretions, making the mucus thinner and easier to expel through coughing.
