# Acetylcholine
### Generic Name
Acetylcholine

### Usage

Acetylcholine is primarily used in ophthalmic surgery.  Its main application is to induce rapid miosis (constriction of the pupil) during procedures such as cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty, and iridectomy.  This rapid pupil constriction is crucial for improved surgical visibility and manipulation of intraocular structures.  While not its primary use, acetylcholine's effect on the ciliary muscle can also lead to a reduction in intraocular pressure, though this is not the reason for its use in these surgical settings.

### Dosage

**Intraoperative Miosis (Adults):**  Acetylcholine is administered directly into the anterior chamber of the eye during surgery. The typical dosage is 0.5 to 2 mL (5 to 20 mg) of a 1% solution. The exact amount used depends on the individual patient and the surgeon's judgment.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of acetylcholine in pediatric patients have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended based on hepatic or renal impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.  However, patients with significant liver or kidney disease should be monitored closely.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are not clearly defined in the provided information but potential effects include:

*   Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
*   Flushing
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
*   Cloudy vision
*   Corneal edema (swelling of the cornea)
*   Corneal decompensation (failure of the cornea to function properly)
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)

Less common but potentially serious side effects may also occur.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Acetylcholine acts as an agonist at muscarinic M3 receptors in the eye. This interaction stimulates the sphincter muscle of the iris, causing it to contract and constrict the pupil (miosis).  Simultaneously, it affects the ciliary muscle, leading to accommodation spasm (temporary focusing difficulty) and a reduction in intraocular pressure, although the miosis effect is the primary therapeutic outcome in surgical settings.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Acetylcholine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to acetylcholine or any component of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of systemic toxicity (adverse effects throughout the body).

* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with acute iritis (inflammation of the iris) or acute inflammatory diseases of the anterior chamber.  Close monitoring is necessary.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Acetylcholine is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The excretion of acetylcholine in breast milk is unknown. It should be used with caution during pregnancy and lactation, and only when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.

* **Drug Interactions:** Acetylcholine's effects may be enhanced by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and beta-blockers.  Careful monitoring is necessary if these drugs are used concurrently.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Acetylcholine administered?**  A: It's administered directly into the anterior chamber of the eye by a surgeon during ophthalmic procedures.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, to your ophthalmologist or doctor immediately.

* **Q: How is Acetylcholine stored?** A:  The provided information states that open vials must be handled under aseptic conditions and should not be gas sterilized. Specific storage instructions for unopened vials are not provided. Consult the product labeling for details.

* **Q: Can I drive after using Acetylcholine?** A: No, patients should avoid driving or operating machinery following the use of ophthalmic acetylcholine due to potential effects on vision.
