# Almagate + Simethicone

**Generic Name:** Aluminum Hydroxide + Simethicone

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of heartburn, upset stomach, and gas.  Aluminum hydroxide is an antacid that neutralizes stomach acid. Simethicone is an antiflatulent that helps break up gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, making them easier to pass.  It's often used for conditions like dyspepsia (indigestion), functional dyspepsia (a type of indigestion with no identifiable cause), and to relieve gas pain after surgery or medical procedures.

**Side Effects:**  While generally well-tolerated, side effects can occur. These are usually mild and may include:

* **Constipation:** This is a relatively common side effect of aluminum-containing antacids.
* **Diarrhea:** Less common than constipation, but can still occur.
* **Headache:** Infrequent.
* **Dizziness:** Rare.
