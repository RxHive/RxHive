# Allopurinol

**Generic Name:** Allopurinol

**Usage:**

Allopurinol is used to treat and prevent gout attacks. It works by reducing the amount of uric acid in your blood. High levels of uric acid can cause gout, a painful type of arthritis.  Allopurinol is also used to treat or prevent kidney stones formed from uric acid and to treat tumor lysis syndrome (a condition that can occur after cancer treatment).  It's important to note that Allopurinol does *not* treat acute gout attacks; it's a preventative medication.  For acute attacks, other medications are necessary.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Rash (this can be serious, see FAQs)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Stomach pain
* Muscle aches

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools)
* Kidney problems
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) â€“ these are rare but life-threatening.
* Blood disorders (decreased blood cell counts)

**How it Works:**

Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that plays a key role in the breakdown of purines (naturally occurring substances in the body) into uric acid. By blocking this enzyme, allopurinol lowers the production of uric acid, allowing the body to gradually eliminate the excess uric acid already present.  This reduction in uric acid levels helps to prevent future gout attacks and the formation of uric acid kidney stones.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take allopurinol during an acute gout attack?** A: No. Allopurinol is for preventing future attacks, not treating current ones.  Your doctor will prescribe other medications to manage the acute pain and inflammation.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: It may take several weeks or months to see a noticeable decrease in uric acid levels and a reduction in gout attacks.  Consistent use is crucial.

* **Q: What should I do if I develop a rash?** A: A rash is a common side effect, but it can sometimes be a sign of a serious allergic reaction.  Stop taking allopurinol immediately and contact your doctor or seek medical attention right away.  This is especially crucial if the rash is accompanied by blistering, peeling skin, or other concerning symptoms.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking allopurinol?** A:  Alcohol can increase uric acid levels and should be limited or avoided while taking allopurinol.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: What are some things I should do to help lower my uric acid levels?** A:  Maintain a healthy weight, drink plenty of fluids, and follow a diet low in purines (found in organ meats, red meat, and some seafood).  Your doctor or a registered dietitian can provide more specific dietary guidance.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, allopurinol can interact with several medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
