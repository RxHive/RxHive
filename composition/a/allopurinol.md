# Allopurinol
### Generic Name
Allopurinol

### Usage

Allopurinol's primary use is in managing gout, both primary (idiopathic) and secondary (caused by another condition).  It works by lowering uric acid levels in the blood, preventing the formation of urate crystals that cause painful gout attacks and kidney stones.  This is achieved through long-term, chronic therapy.

Beyond gout, allopurinol also plays a crucial role in preventing nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), particularly those composed of uric acid or calcium.  It is also used in the management of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a potentially life-threatening complication of cancer treatment where the rapid breakdown of cancer cells releases large amounts of uric acid into the bloodstream.  In TLS, allopurinol helps prevent the dangerous buildup of uric acid.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and kidney function, and the chosen route of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Gout:** Typically starts at 100mg daily, increased gradually (every 2-4 weeks) in 100mg increments until serum uric acid reaches the target level.  Maintenance doses often exceed 300mg daily, up to a maximum of 800mg daily.  The dose may be divided if gastrointestinal side effects occur.
* **Nephrolithiasis Prevention:** Often 300mg daily, possibly divided into smaller doses.
* **Tumor Lysis Syndrome Prevention:**  Dosage depends on whether it's given orally or intravenously and the patient's body surface area (BSA) or weight. Oral doses can range from 300 mg/m²/day to 10 mg/kg/day.  Intravenous administration uses dosages of 200-400 mg/m²/day.  Always consult a physician regarding appropriate dosage and administration schedule for this condition.

**Children:**  Dosage is significantly different and is weight- or BSA-based. It's crucial to consult a pediatrician for accurate dosage calculations, especially for hyperuricemia associated with chemotherapy or inborn errors of purine metabolism (like Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).  Dosages can range from 5-10 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/m²/dose, depending on the specific condition and the child's age and weight.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Rash
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Acute gout flares (especially at the start of treatment)
* Renal failure or insufficiency
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Blood disorders (e.g., agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome)

**Important Note:**  Stop taking allopurinol and seek immediate medical attention if you experience a rash, especially if accompanied by fever, blisters, or mouth sores.  These could be signs of a severe allergic reaction.

### How it Works

Allopurinol works by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase. This enzyme is responsible for converting xanthine and hypoxanthine (purine breakdown products) into uric acid.  By blocking this enzyme, allopurinol significantly reduces the production of uric acid in the body.  The reduced uric acid levels prevent the formation of urate crystals, relieving symptoms of gout and reducing the risk of kidney stones.  A metabolite of allopurinol, oxipurinol, also contributes to this inhibitory action.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Allopurinol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.  Genetic testing for the HLA-B*58:01 allele might be done before starting treatment in some cases, to identify individuals at higher risk of severe skin reactions.
* **Kidney Disease:** Dosage adjustment is necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function. Lower doses are recommended to prevent the accumulation of the drug, which could cause further harm.
* **Liver Disease:**  While no specific dosage adjustments are generally stated, it’s important to monitor liver function regularly if there is pre-existing liver disease.
* **Interactions with Other Medications:** Allopurinol can interact with several drugs, including azathioprine, mercaptopurine, warfarin, and some diuretics. Consult a healthcare provider about potential interactions before combining allopurinol with other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Allopurinol is a category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its effects on the developing fetus are unknown. It is also excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding during allopurinol use potentially risky. Discuss with your doctor the risks and benefits of continuing allopurinol if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Children usually need a lower dose adjusted by weight or body surface area. Pediatric use is generally limited to specific indications, like hyperuricemia associated with cancer treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take allopurinol during a gout flare?** A: While ideally initiated during a flare-free period, allopurinol can sometimes be started during a flare in conjunction with anti-inflammatory medication.
* **Q: How long does it take for allopurinol to work?** A: It can take several weeks or months to see a significant reduction in uric acid levels and a decrease in gout symptoms.
* **Q: How should I store allopurinol?** A: Store allopurinol tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking allopurinol?** A: Excessive alcohol consumption is generally discouraged while taking allopurinol as it can interfere with uric acid metabolism and potentially exacerbate gout symptoms.
* **Q: Are there any dietary restrictions while taking allopurinol?** A: A doctor might recommend some dietary changes, but it's generally advised to maintain a balanced diet.
