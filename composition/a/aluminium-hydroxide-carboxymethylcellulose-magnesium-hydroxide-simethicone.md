# Aluminium Hydroxide + Carboxymethylcellulose + Magnesium Hydroxide + Simethicone

**Generic Name:**  Aluminum Hydroxide/Magnesium Hydroxide/Simethicone/Carboxymethylcellulose

**(Note: There isn't one single generic name for this combination.  Pharmaceutical companies will often use a proprietary brand name. The above represents the combination of generic ingredients.)**


**Usage:**

This combination of drugs is used to treat heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach.  Each ingredient plays a specific role:

* **Aluminum Hydroxide & Magnesium Hydroxide:** These are antacids that neutralize stomach acid, providing rapid relief from heartburn symptoms.  Magnesium hydroxide is a stronger antacid than aluminum hydroxide.
* **Simethicone:** This is an anti-foaming agent that helps relieve gas and bloating by breaking up gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines.
* **Carboxymethylcellulose:** This is a bulk-forming laxative that adds bulk to the stool, which can help with constipation that might be caused by the aluminum hydroxide (which can cause constipation as a side effect).


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Constipation:** This is more likely with aluminum hydroxide.
* **Diarrhea:** This is more likely with magnesium hydroxide.  The combination aims to balance these effects.
* **Gas:** Although simethicone is added to reduce gas, some individuals might still experience it.
* **Nausea:**  Rare.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.
* **Long-term use:**  Excessive aluminum intake can interfere with phosphate absorption, which is important for bone health.  This is more of a concern with long-term, high-dose use.


**How it Works:**

As mentioned above, each ingredient acts differently:

* **Aluminum Hydroxide & Magnesium Hydroxide:** Neutralize stomach acid by reacting with it chemically, reducing acidity.
* **Simethicone:** Breaks up gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating their expulsion.
* **Carboxymethylcellulose:**  Increases the bulk and water content of the stool, promoting regular bowel movements.
