# Abacavir + Lamivudine

**Generic Name:** Abacavir + Lamivudine

**Usage:**

Abacavir + Lamivudine is an antiretroviral medication used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children weighing at least 25 kg (approximately 55 lbs).  It is *not* a cure for HIV, but it helps to suppress the virus, allowing the immune system to rebuild and improving the quality of life for people with HIV.  It is typically part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.  The specific dosage and regimen will be determined by a physician based on individual factors.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Headache:** Frequently reported.
* **Nausea:** Can be mild to moderate.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Diarrhea:** May be mild or severe.
* **Abdominal pain:**  Can range from mild discomfort to significant pain.
* **Rash:**  Important to note, a serious hypersensitivity reaction can occur (see below).

Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention. These include:

* **Hypersensitivity reaction:** This is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.  Symptoms can include fever, rash, fatigue, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath.  **This reaction can be fatal if not treated immediately.**  Patients should be closely monitored for these symptoms, and the medication should be stopped immediately if they occur.
* **Lactic acidosis:** A buildup of lactic acid in the blood, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms may include fatigue, muscle weakness, abdominal pain, nausea, and rapid breathing.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause severe abdominal pain.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Liver damage.

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  Consult a healthcare professional for a complete list and to discuss any concerns.


**How it Works:**

Abacavir and lamivudine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  They work by interfering with the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which HIV needs to replicate its genetic material.  Abacavir and lamivudine are structurally similar, but they inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme in slightly different ways, improving effectiveness when used together.  By blocking reverse transcriptase, they reduce the amount of HIV in the body.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Abacavir + Lamivudine?**  While moderate alcohol consumption is usually not prohibited, it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor. Excessive alcohol use can negatively interact with liver function and other aspects of your health, especially when already taking medications.

* **Can I take other medications with Abacavir + Lamivudine?**  You must inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as interactions can occur.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose.
