# Albendazole + Levamisole

**Generic Name:** Albendazole + Levamisole

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used to treat various types of intestinal helminth infections (worm infestations), particularly those caused by nematodes (roundworms) and cestodes (tapeworms).  Specific indications may vary depending on regional guidelines and the prevalence of specific parasites.  It is often prescribed for infections such as:

* **Nematode infections:**  Including ascariasis (roundworm), hookworm infections, trichuriasis (whipworm), and strongyloidiasis.
* **Cestode infections:**  Including taeniasis (tapeworm).

It's crucial to note that this combination is not effective against all types of parasitic infections.  A proper diagnosis by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the correct medication and dosage.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fatigue**
* **Elevated liver enzymes (liver function tests may be abnormal)**
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling
* **Blood disorders (rare but serious):**  Levamisole can affect the blood cell counts.


More serious, though rare, side effects may include:

* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)**
* **Liver damage**
* **Neurological effects**


**How it Works:** Albendazole and levamisole work through different mechanisms to eliminate parasites:

* **Albendazole:**  It interferes with the glucose uptake and microtubule formation of the parasites, ultimately leading to their paralysis and death.  This affects the parasite's ability to function and reproduce.

* **Levamisole:**  It acts as an immunostimulant, boosting the body's immune response to help fight the infection. It also has some direct anthelmintic (anti-worm) activity.

The combination of these two drugs provides a broader-spectrum anthelmintic effect and potentially enhances efficacy compared to using either drug alone.
