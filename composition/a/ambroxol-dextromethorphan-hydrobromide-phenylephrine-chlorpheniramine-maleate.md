# Ambroxol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It aims to relieve a range of symptoms simultaneously:

* **Ambroxol:**  A mucolytic agent that thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** An antitussive (cough suppressant) that helps reduce coughing.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes associated with allergies or the common cold.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness or Sedation:** This is particularly common with chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry Mouth:** A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Nausea:**  Less frequent, but possible.
* **Constipation:**  A potential side effect.
* **Headache:**  Can occur.
* **Dizziness:** Possible, especially in elderly individuals.
* **Insomnia:**  Less likely with some formulations but possible with higher doses or individual sensitivity.
* **Increased Heart Rate (Tachycardia):**  Potentially from phenylephrine.
* **High Blood Pressure:**  Potentially from phenylephrine, especially in those with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Although rare, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling) are possible.


**How it Works:**  The drug works through a combination of mechanisms:

* **Ambroxol:** Increases the secretion of fluid in the respiratory tract, making mucus less viscous and easier to expectorate.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Phenylephrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing) and reducing nasal congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions, thus alleviating symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
