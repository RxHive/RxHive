# Atogepant
### Generic Name
Atogepant

### Usage
Atogepant is primarily used for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults.  This means it's designed to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks, not to treat a migraine once it has already started.  Currently, it is not approved for other conditions.


### Dosage
The recommended dose of Atogepant for migraine prevention in adults is 10 mg, 30 mg, or 60 mg once daily (OD). The maximum recommended dose is 60 mg per day.  Atogepant is available as an oral tablet.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for those with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B). Atogepant is not recommended for use in individuals with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:** For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 mL/min or greater, no dosage adjustment is necessary.  If CrCl is less than 30 mL/min, the dose should be reduced to 10 mg OD.  In patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, the dose is also 10 mg OD, administered after dialysis on dialysis days.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary when Atogepant is co-administered with certain medications.  The dose should be reduced to 10 mg daily when used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin).  When used with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers, the dose may need to be increased to 30 mg or 60 mg daily.  Similarly, when co-administered with OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors, the dose may need to be reduced to 10 mg or 30 mg daily.  Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance on dose adjustments based on other medications being taken.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Atogepant have not been established in children.


### Side Effects
**Common side effects (1-10%):**

* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Nausea
* Weight loss

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** Increased levels of serum transaminases (liver enzymes).  This requires monitoring and may necessitate discontinuation of the medication.

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Atogepant works by blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. CGRP is a protein involved in the transmission of pain signals in the brain, particularly those associated with migraine headaches. By preventing CGRP from binding to its receptor, Atogepant helps reduce the occurrence and severity of migraine attacks.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** There is insufficient data on the use of Atogepant during pregnancy.  The potential risks to the developing fetus should be considered.  It is unknown whether Atogepant is excreted in breast milk; the benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against potential risks to the infant.
* **Elderly Patients:** Atogepant should be used cautiously in older adults, often starting at a lower dose due to potential age-related changes in liver and kidney function.
* **Drug Interactions:** Atogepant interacts with certain medications, particularly those that affect the CYP3A4 and OATP1B1/1B3 enzymes.  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on the severity of liver and kidney disease.
