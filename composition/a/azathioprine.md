# Azathioprine
### Generic Name
Azathioprine

### Usage

Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant medication primarily used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation, particularly kidney transplants.  It's also used as an adjunctive therapy in certain autoimmune diseases to reduce inflammation and symptoms.  While it has been used in rheumatoid arthritis, current guidelines favor other medications as first-line treatment.  Azathioprine's use in other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and certain types of vasculitis, is considered off-label, meaning it's used outside of its officially approved indications.  The decision to use azathioprine for off-label purposes should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, considering the patient's individual circumstances and the potential risks and benefits.

### Dosage

Azathioprine dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and other health factors.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage regimen precisely as directed by a healthcare provider.

**Adult Dosage (Examples â€“ Always consult prescribing information):**

* **Kidney Transplant (Prevention of Rejection):**  Initial dose typically ranges from 2-5 mg/kg/day given intravenously (IV) or orally. Maintenance doses are usually lower, often 1-3 mg/kg/day orally.  These dosages can be adjusted based on individual patient tolerance and response. The use of Azathioprine as a first-line agent for prevention of rejection is no longer recommended.

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Initial oral doses are typically lower, around 1 mg/kg/day, gradually increased over several weeks to a maximum of 2.5 mg/kg/day based on the individual patient response. The use of Azathioprine in Rheumatoid Arthritis is infrequent and not a first-line approach.

* **Off-Label Uses:**  Dosage varies considerably depending on the specific off-label indication (e.g., Crohn's disease, autoimmune hepatitis).  Precise dosage recommendations should be obtained from a healthcare professional familiar with these uses.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Azathioprine's use in children is often based on weight and the specific condition.  Dosage determination for pediatric use requires careful consideration and should only be done under the direct supervision of a specialist experienced with treating children with immunosuppressants.  Dosage information should be sourced from the prescribing information to determine the appropriate dose based on the condition.


**Administration:**

Oral azathioprine is typically taken with food to minimize gastrointestinal upset. IV administration requires careful monitoring by trained healthcare personnel.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased white blood cell count (leukopenia).  Less common but more serious side effects can involve bone marrow suppression, liver damage, pancreatitis, infections, and increased risk of certain cancers (including lymphoma).  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.  Many of these side effects are dose dependent and may be reduced by adjusting the dosage.


* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia.
* **Serious (Less Common):** Bone marrow suppression, liver damage (hepatotoxicity), pancreatitis, increased risk of infections, increased risk of certain cancers (lymphoma, skin cancer).

### How it Works

Azathioprine is a prodrug; it's converted in the body to 6-mercaptopurine, which interferes with the production of DNA and RNA in rapidly dividing cells, including immune cells. By suppressing the immune system, it helps prevent organ rejection and reduces inflammation in autoimmune diseases.  The exact mechanisms by which it affects various diseases remain complex and the subject of ongoing research.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Azathioprine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it or its components and in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis. It should also be avoided in patients with active severe infections.
* **Interactions:**  Azathioprine interacts with numerous medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, herbal remedies, and supplements being taken to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.  This includes other immunosuppressants, allopurinol, and certain antibiotics.
* **Warnings:**  Patients should be monitored closely for signs of infection, bone marrow suppression, and liver damage. Regular blood tests are frequently necessary.  Azathioprine increases the risk of developing certain cancers.  Women of childbearing age should use appropriate contraception.  Careful consideration is necessary during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Azathioprine with other medications?** A:  No.  Inform your doctor of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to prevent dangerous drug interactions.
* **Q: How should I store Azathioprine?** A: Store Azathioprine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses; do not double up on doses.
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of Azathioprine?** A: Long-term use can increase the risk of infections and certain cancers; regular monitoring is essential.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Azathioprine?** A: Consult your doctor.  Alcohol can sometimes interact negatively with medications; you may need to reduce your alcohol intake or avoid it entirely.
* **Q: Is Azathioprine safe during pregnancy?** A: It's not considered safe for all pregnancies and its use in pregnancy will be carefully assessed by the prescribing physician.  The decision will depend greatly on the medical condition being treated.
