# Azathioprine

**Generic Name:** Azathioprine

**Usage:**

Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant medication primarily used to:

* **Prevent organ rejection:**  Following organ transplantation (kidney, liver, heart, etc.), azathioprine helps prevent the recipient's immune system from attacking the transplanted organ.  It's usually used in combination with other immunosuppressants.
* **Treat autoimmune diseases:**  Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and lupus nephritis may be treated with azathioprine to suppress the overactive immune response causing inflammation and damage.
* **Treat certain types of vasculitis:**  Some forms of vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) may respond to azathioprine treatment.


**Side Effects:**

Azathioprine can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity from mild to life-threatening.  Some common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite
* **Infection:** Increased susceptibility to infections due to immunosuppression
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  This can lead to low blood cell counts (leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia), increasing the risk of bleeding and infection.  Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor this.
* **Liver damage:** Elevated liver enzymes are a potential side effect.
* **Hair loss (alopecia):**  This is a less common side effect.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):** A rare but serious side effect.
* **Increased risk of certain cancers:**  Long-term use is associated with a slightly increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma and skin cancer.


**How it Works:**

Azathioprine is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), in the body.  6-MP interferes with the production of nucleic acids, which are essential for cell growth and division, particularly in rapidly dividing immune cells. By inhibiting the production of these cells, azathioprine reduces the activity of the immune system, thereby preventing organ rejection or suppressing the autoimmune response.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How often do I need blood tests while taking azathioprine?**  A:  Regular blood tests (typically weekly or monthly at first, then less frequently) are essential to monitor your blood counts (complete blood count or CBC) and liver function.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking azathioprine?**  A:  Alcohol can potentially worsen some side effects of azathioprine and may also interact with other medications you might be taking.  Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take a double dose.
* **Q: Can I take azathioprine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Azathioprine is generally avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of birth defects.  It's also not usually recommended during breastfeeding.  Discuss this carefully with your doctor.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, unusual bleeding or bruising, fever, persistent nausea/vomiting, yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) require immediate medical attention.
