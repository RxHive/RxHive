**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Tizanidine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve moderate to severe pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis

* Post-operative pain
* Soft tissue injuries
* Back pain


**Side Effects:**  The side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Common side effects include:

**How it Works:** This combination medication works through a synergistic effect of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, primarily affecting the central nervous system.  Its exact mechanism of action in pain relief is still not fully understood.
* **Tizanidine:** A muscle relaxant that works by acting on the central nervous system to reduce muscle spasms and stiffness.  It is a centrally acting alpha2-adrenergic agonist.
