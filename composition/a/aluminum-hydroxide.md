# Aluminum Hydroxide
### Generic Name
Aluminum Hydroxide

### Usage
Aluminum hydroxide is primarily used as an antacid to relieve symptoms associated with excess stomach acid, such as heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach.  Its action neutralizes stomach acid, providing temporary relief.  A significant secondary use is in the management of hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels in the blood), particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  In CKD, the kidneys are less efficient at removing phosphate, and aluminum hydroxide helps bind to phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption.  Additionally, it has topical applications for temporary relief of minor skin irritations, burns, and abrasions.

### Dosage

**Oral Administration:**

* **Hyperphosphatemia (Adults):**  Up to 10 grams daily, divided into several doses.  The specific dosage is adjusted based on individual patient needs and serum phosphate levels, always under the guidance of a physician.
* **Hyperphosphatemia (Children):** 50-150 mg/kg/day, divided into doses every 4-6 hours. Dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain normal serum phosphorus levels, under strict medical supervision.
* **Hyperacidity (Adults):** Up to 1 gram after meals and at bedtime, as needed.

**Topical Administration:**

* For minor skin irritations, burns, and abrasions, apply a 0.275% gel to the affected area as needed.  Follow the instructions on the specific product packaging.


**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual factors like age, weight, kidney function, and the severity of the condition.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage regimen exactly as directed by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Constipation, discoloration of feces, nausea, stomach cramps, vomiting.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels), aluminum toxicity (especially in patients with impaired kidney function).

If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

As an antacid, aluminum hydroxide works by neutralizing stomach acid (hydrochloric acid) through a chemical reaction, which raises the pH of the stomach contents and reduces the activity of pepsin, a digestive enzyme. In hyperphosphatemia, it binds to phosphate ions in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream.  This lowers the phosphate levels in the blood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Aluminum hydroxide should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to aluminum or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aluminum hydroxide can interact with many medications, reducing their absorption.  This includes, but isn't limited to, tetracyclines, quinolones, biphosphonates, and many others.  Inform your doctor about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Caution is necessary in patients with kidney problems, as aluminum can accumulate in the body, potentially leading to toxicity.  Close monitoring is essential.
* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure, edema, cirrhosis, or a history of recent massive gastrointestinal bleeding.  Elderly patients are at increased risk of fecal impaction.  The use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take aluminum hydroxide?** A:  For hyperacidity, it's generally for short-term relief. For hyperphosphatemia, it's a long-term treatment under medical supervision.
* **Q: Can I take aluminum hydroxide with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining aluminum hydroxide with other medications, as interactions can occur.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store aluminum hydroxide?** A:  Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q:  Is aluminum hydroxide safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: The safety of aluminum hydroxide during pregnancy and breastfeeding needs to be carefully evaluated by a physician.  The use is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding in normal doses but close monitoring of the infant is advised.
