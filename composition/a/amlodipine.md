# Amlodipine
### Generic Name
Amlodipine

### Usage
Amlodipine is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  It works by relaxing blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.  This helps lower blood pressure and reduces the strain on the heart.

Beyond hypertension, amlodipine is also prescribed for chronic stable angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart) and vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal's angina), a type of angina caused by spasms in the coronary arteries.  In these conditions, amlodipine helps improve blood flow to the heart muscle, reducing chest pain.  It's important to note that amlodipine may also be used off-label for conditions like Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to the extremities).

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Hypertension:**  The usual starting dose is 2.5-5 mg once daily.  The dose may be increased to a maximum of 10 mg once daily, as directed by a physician, based on individual response and blood pressure monitoring.  Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other blood pressure medications.
* **Angina (Chronic Stable and Vasospastic):** The typical dose is 5-10 mg once daily.  The specific dose will be determined by the doctor considering the patient's individual needs.

**Children (6-17 years):**

* **Hypertension:** The starting dose is typically 2.5-5 mg once daily.  The dose may be increased to a maximum of 10 mg daily, but only under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.  Dosage is often determined based on weight and response.
* **Raynaud's Phenomenon (off-label):** The dosage is typically started low and adjusted as needed, based on the child's response and tolerability.

**Children (1-5 years):**

* **Hypertension:** Amlodipine's effects on blood pressure in children younger than 6 are not fully established.  If prescribed, the dosage will be carefully determined by a physician based on weight (starting at 0.1mg/kg/day) and closely monitored.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver impairment or elderly patients.  Those with kidney impairment generally do not require dosage adjustments.  Always consult a doctor before making any changes to the prescribed dosage.  The medication is typically taken orally once a day, and the timing doesn't need to be related to meals.

### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**

* Peripheral edema (swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Nausea

**Less common but serious side effects:**

* Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue (angioedema â€“ seek immediate medical attention)
* Rapid or irregular heartbeat
* Chest pain
* Shortness of breath
* Liver problems
* Severe skin reactions


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Amlodipine belongs to a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers.  It works by relaxing the blood vessels. Calcium ions play a crucial role in the contraction of smooth muscles in blood vessel walls. Amlodipine blocks the entry of calcium ions into these muscles, causing them to relax and widen (vasodilation).  This widening of the blood vessels reduces the resistance to blood flow, lowering blood pressure and decreasing the workload on the heart.  For angina, this increased blood flow improves oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amlodipine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and in patients with severe hypotension.  It is also contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:** Amlodipine can interact with several other medications, including some antifungals, antibiotics, and other blood pressure medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amlodipine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Amlodipine is excreted in breast milk and is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:** Amlodipine should be used with caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, hepatic impairment, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Elderly patients may require lower doses due to increased sensitivity.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Amlodipine?**  A: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol can worsen the effects of Amlodipine and increase the risk of low blood pressure.  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store Amlodipine?** A: Store Amlodipine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Amlodipine suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking Amlodipine suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure, potentially causing serious health problems.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce your dosage if needed.

* **Q:  Is Amlodipine safe for long-term use?** A: Amlodipine is generally considered safe for long-term use when prescribed and monitored by a doctor. Regular checkups are important to monitor blood pressure and assess for any side effects.
