# Aceclofenac + Diacerein

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Diacerein

**Usage:**  This combination is primarily used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis (OA), particularly in the knees and hips.  It's often prescribed when other pain relievers haven't provided sufficient relief.  It's important to note that this combination does *not* cure osteoarthritis; it only manages the symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Aceclofenac + Diacerein can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, indigestion, peptic ulcers (rare but serious), gastrointestinal bleeding (rare but serious).
* **Central Nervous System:**  Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Skin:**  Rash, itching, hives.
* **Liver:**  Elevated liver enzymes (rare but serious).
* **Kidney:**  Fluid retention, changes in kidney function (rare but serious).
* **Other:**  Allergic reactions (rare but serious), increased bleeding time.

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention.  These include:** severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), signs of liver or kidney damage, significant gastrointestinal bleeding.

**How it Works:** This combination drug works through two different mechanisms:

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Diacerein:** This is a disease-modifying osteoarthritic drug (DMOAD). Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and stimulate the production of cartilage proteoglycans, potentially helping to slow down cartilage damage.

The combination leverages both the immediate pain-relieving effects of Aceclofenac and the potential long-term cartilage-protective effects of Diacerein.
