# Aceclofenac + Diacerein
### Generic Name
Aceclofenac + Diacerein

### Usage
Aceclofenac + Diacerein is a combination medication primarily used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis.  Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease causing cartilage breakdown, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced joint mobility. This combination drug targets both the pain (aceclofenac) and the underlying disease process (diacerein).  While its primary use is osteoarthritis, it may sometimes be considered for other inflammatory conditions affecting the joints, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats symptoms and doesn't cure the underlying condition.


### Dosage
Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary based on the individual's condition, age, and response to treatment.  There is no universally standardized dosage, and what is listed below is for informational purposes only and should *not* be considered medical advice.  **Never self-medicate.**

* **Typical Adult Dosage (Oral):** The common regimen involves taking one tablet once or twice daily, usually with food to minimize stomach upset. The precise dosage and frequency will be determined by the prescribing physician.

### How it Works
Aceclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation. Diacerein, on the other hand, is a chondroprotective agent meaning it helps to protect and potentially regenerate cartilage.  It works by inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines and promoting the production of glycosaminoglycans (important components of cartilage).  The combination aims to address both the pain and inflammation (aceclofenac) and potentially slow the progression of cartilage damage (diacerein).


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to aceclofenac, diacerein, or any of the excipients.  It should also be avoided in patients with severe liver or kidney disease, active peptic ulcers, or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Aceclofenac, being an NSAID, can interact with several other drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), aspirin, other NSAIDs, and some diuretics. Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
