**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the synergistic effects of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** A muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms and pain.  Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's thought to act on the central nervous system.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works by reducing fever and providing pain relief, though the precise mechanism is not fully understood. It's thought to act centrally on the hypothalamus, reducing the production of prostaglandins in the brain.
