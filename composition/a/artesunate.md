# Artesunate
### Generic Name
Artesunate

### Usage
Artesunate is an antimalarial drug primarily used to treat severe malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*. It's a crucial component of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for both severe and uncomplicated malaria.  While effective against *P. falciparum*, it's important to note that artesunate alone doesn't eliminate the liver stages of *Plasmodium vivax* or *Plasmodium ovale*, meaning it won't prevent relapses caused by these parasites. Therefore, additional medication is usually necessary in those cases.  Artesunate is often used in combination with other antimalarials to enhance efficacy and prevent the development of resistance.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the severity of malaria, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (intravenous, intramuscular, or oral).  **Always follow the specific instructions provided by a healthcare professional.**  The following information is for general understanding and should not be considered a prescription.

* **Severe Malaria (WHO Recommendations):**  Intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration is typically used. The initial dose is usually 2.4 mg/kg, followed by another 2.4 mg/kg dose after 12 and 24 hours.  Subsequent doses are given once daily until the patient can tolerate oral medication. After at least 24 hours of parenteral treatment, a full course of oral ACT is started to complete treatment.

* **Uncomplicated Malaria (WHO Recommendations):** Oral administration is standard. The typical adult dose is 200 mg once daily for 3 days, always in combination with another antimalarial drug such as amodiaquine, mefloquine, or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.  Monotherapy with artesunate is not recommended.

* **Pediatric Dosage (WHO Recommendations):** For uncomplicated malaria in children and adolescents, oral artesunate is typically given at a dose of 4 mg/kg once daily for 3 days (range: 2-10 mg/kg daily, not exceeding 200 mg/day).  This must always be combined with another antimalarial medication.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  Generally, no dosage adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, this should always be confirmed with a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Neurological signs and symptoms, hemoglobinuria (blood in urine), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), acute renal failure.

* **Less Common (frequency not defined):** Ataxia (lack of coordination), balance impairment, confusion, paresis (muscle weakness), restlessness, asthenia (weakness), tremor.

* **Post-Marketing Reports (rare):** Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), hemolytic anemia, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

### How it Works

Artesunate is converted in the body to dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the active metabolite. DHA interferes with the malaria parasite's metabolism, leading to its death.  It achieves this by inhibiting the parasite's ability to replicate its DNA and transcribe its genetic information, effectively stopping its growth and reproduction.  DHA also enhances the clearance of infected red blood cells from the body.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Artesunate is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis) to artesunate or any components of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients may have an increased risk of hemolysis (red blood cell destruction) and hypersensitivity reactions.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Artesunate can interact with other antimalarial drugs.  Its use with mefloquine, primaquine, tetracycline, chloroquine, pyrimethamine, and sulfonamides requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.  Concomitant use is generally not recommended due to potential additive or antagonistic effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Artesunate is considered safe for the treatment of severe malaria during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, healthcare professionals should be consulted before administering artesunate to pregnant or breastfeeding women.

* **General Considerations:**  Oral artesunate tablets should be taken with water, not with a high-fat meal.  If vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of ingestion, the dose should be repeated. For intravenous or intramuscular administration, specific dilution and administration guidelines must be carefully followed.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take artesunate without a prescription?** A: No, artesunate should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  Malaria diagnosis and treatment require expert medical attention.

* **Q: How should I store artesunate?** A: Store artesunate according to the label instructions, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider for guidance on missed doses. Do not attempt to self-adjust the dosage.

* **Q: Is artesunate effective against all types of malaria?** A: No, artesunate is primarily effective against *Plasmodium falciparum*. It does not eliminate the liver stages of *P. vivax* or *P. ovale*, requiring additional medication to prevent relapses.

* **Q: Are there any long-term side effects associated with artesunate?** A: While generally well-tolerated, prolonged or high-dose use may be associated with some side effects.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is important.
