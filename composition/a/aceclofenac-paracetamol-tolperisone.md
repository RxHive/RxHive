# Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Tolperisone

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Tolperisone

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Back pain
* Muscle spasms
* Soft tissue injuries


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, abdominal pain, dizziness, drowsiness, headache,  skin rash.

* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis),  liver damage, kidney problems, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation (especially in individuals with a history of ulcers).


**How it Works:** This combination medication works through the synergistic action of its three components:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that contribute to pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** An analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) that works through a different mechanism than NSAIDs, providing additional pain relief and potentially reducing fever associated with inflammation.  The exact mechanism of action of paracetamol is still not fully understood.
* **Tolperisone:** A muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms and stiffness by reducing the excitability of the spinal cord, leading to decreased muscle tension.
