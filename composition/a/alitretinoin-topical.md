# Alitretinoin (Topical)
### Generic Name
Alitretinoin (Topical)

### Usage
Alitretinoin topical gel is a retinoid used to treat cutaneous (skin) lesions of Kaposi sarcoma associated with AIDS.  It's specifically indicated for topical application to skin lesions; it is *not* intended for use when systemic treatment (affecting the whole body) is necessary.  This means it's not appropriate if the patient is experiencing a rapid increase in lesions (more than 10 new lesions in the previous month),  symptomatic internal organ involvement, symptomatic lung Kaposi sarcoma, or symptomatic lymphedema (swelling due to lymphatic system blockage). There's no established experience using alitretinoin topically alongside systemic Kaposi sarcoma treatments.

### Dosage

**Kaposi Sarcoma:**

* **Adults:**  The initial dose is applying 0.1% gel twice daily (BID) directly to the affected skin lesions. The frequency can be gradually increased to three or four times daily, depending on how well the skin tolerates the treatment.  Response may be seen within two weeks, but often takes longer â€“ sometimes more than 14 weeks. Treatment should continue as long as the patient benefits; in clinical trials, treatment lasted up to 96 weeks.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of alitretinoin topical in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic (Liver) Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment. However, since systemic absorption is minimal, dosage adjustment is likely unnecessary.

* **Renal (Kidney) Impairment:**  Similar to hepatic impairment, the manufacturer doesn't offer dosage adjustments for kidney problems.  Due to low systemic absorption, adjustment is probably not required.

* **Toxicity Management (Skin Irritation):**
    * Grades 0, 1, or 2 skin irritation: No dose adjustment is needed.
    * Grade 3 skin irritation: Reduce application to once daily (OD) or reduce the frequency or temporarily withhold treatment for up to two weeks; restart when irritation improves to grade 1 or less.
    * Grade 4 skin irritation: Discontinue until irritation improves to grade 1 or less within two weeks, then restart at less than once daily for two weeks before gradually increasing application frequency. If grade 4 irritation occurs even at low doses, treatment should not be restarted.


### Side Effects

* **Common (affecting more than 10% of patients):** Pain, tingling or numbness (paresthesia), skin rash, and itching (pruritus).
* **Less Common (affecting 1-10% of patients):** Swelling (edema), exfoliative dermatitis (severe skin inflammation with shedding of skin), and other skin problems.
* **Serious (though less frequent):** While rare, severe skin reactions can occur.  Any unusual or worsening skin reactions require immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Alitretinoin is a retinoid, a type of vitamin A derivative. It works by binding to and activating receptors inside cells (RAR and RXR subtypes). This activation alters gene expression, influencing cell growth and differentiation.  In the context of Kaposi sarcoma, this ultimately inhibits the growth of the cancerous cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Alitretinoin topical is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to alitretinoin, other retinoids, or any components of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of skin irritation and photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Alitretinoin is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Women of childbearing age should avoid pregnancy during treatment. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment as excretion in breast milk is unknown.


* **Interactions:** Alitretinoin can interact with certain medications, particularly photosensitizing agents (substances that increase sun sensitivity) like aminolevulinic acid (both systemic and topical) and others such as porfimer and verteporfin.  It may also interact with multivitamins containing vitamins A, D, and E.  Consult a healthcare professional about potential drug interactions.

* **General Considerations:** Apply a generous amount of gel to cover the lesions, letting it dry for 3-5 minutes before covering with clothing.  Avoid occlusive dressings and applying the gel to normal skin or near mucous membranes. Minimize sun exposure to treated areas and avoid using other topical products containing DEET concurrently.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Response can vary, with some patients seeing improvement within two weeks, while others may need more than 14 weeks.

* **Q: Can I use other topical products with alitretinoin?** A: It's best to avoid using other topical products concurrently, especially those containing DEET.  Consult your doctor before combining with any other topical treatments.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe skin irritation?** A:  Stop using the medication and contact your doctor immediately.

* **Q: How should I store alitretinoin?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Is alitretinoin suitable for all types of Kaposi sarcoma?** A: No, it is only suitable for cutaneous lesions and not for systemic Kaposi sarcoma.
