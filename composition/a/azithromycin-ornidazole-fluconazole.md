# Azithromycin + Ornidazole + Fluconazole
### Generic Name
Azithromycin + Ornidazole + Fluconazole Combination

**Note:** This combination is not a single FDA-approved drug product. It represents a combination of three individual generic medications frequently prescribed together for specific infections, based on physician judgment.  Each component's properties are described below;  however, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for any medical concerns, as the appropriateness and dosage of this combination depend entirely on individual patient needs and the specific infection being treated.


### Usage

This combination of Azithromycin, Ornidazole, and Fluconazole is typically used to treat infections caused by a variety of microorganisms, often those affecting the gastrointestinal tract and/or reproductive system.  The specific infections targeted are a complex interplay of the individual drug actions:


* **Azithromycin:**  A macrolide antibiotic effective against a wide range of bacteria, including *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, and some strains of *Haemophilus influenzae*.  It's frequently used to treat respiratory infections, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and skin infections.

* **Ornidazole:** A nitroimidazole antibiotic effective against various anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.  It's commonly used to treat bacterial vaginosis, giardiasis, and amebiasis (amoebic dysentery).

* **Fluconazole:** A triazole antifungal medication effective against various fungal infections.  Itâ€™s used to treat candidiasis (yeast infections) affecting various parts of the body, including the vagina, mouth (thrush), and bloodstream.


The combination aims to provide broad-spectrum coverage against bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, often addressing mixed infections.


### Dosage

There's no standardized dosage for this combination as it's not a single pharmaceutical product.  The dosage of each component depends entirely on the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, kidney and liver function, and the prescribing physician's judgment.   The following represents *possible* dosage ranges; **a healthcare professional must determine the appropriate dosage in each case.**

**Azithromycin:**
* **Oral:** Adults: Typically 500mg on the first day, followed by 250mg daily for four days (or other regimens as directed by physician). Children's dosages vary significantly with weight and age; this must be determined by a physician.
* **IV:** Dosages depend on the infection and patient factors, always determined and administered by a healthcare professional.

**Ornidazole:**
* **Oral:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the indication.  Adults typically receive a single dose or a short course (e.g., 500mg once or twice daily for several days), but the specific regimen is prescribed by a healthcare provider.  Children's dosages are determined by a physician based on weight and age.
* **IV:**  Dosages depend on the infection and patient factors, always determined and administered by a healthcare professional.

**Fluconazole:**
* **Oral:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection.  Common adult dosages range from 50mg to 400mg once daily or less frequently, with the duration determined by the treating physician.  Pediatric dosages are carefully calculated based on weight and age by a physician.
* **IV:** Dosages depend on the infection and patient factors, always determined and administered by a healthcare professional.

**Administration:** Oral medications are typically taken with or without food (check product information), while IV administration is performed by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting.
