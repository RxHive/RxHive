# Anti-Thymocyte Immunoglobulin (Rabbit)
### Generic Name
Anti-Thymocyte Immunoglobulin (Rabbit)

### Usage
Anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit) is primarily used to prevent and treat acute rejection in patients who have received a kidney transplant.  It's also used off-label in other transplantation settings, including heart, lung, liver, intestinal, and multivisceral transplants, often as part of induction therapy (given at the beginning of the transplant process to suppress the immune system).  Additionally, it has off-label uses in treating refractory aplastic anemia and preventing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  The off-label uses require careful consideration and are typically employed by specialists experienced in managing these complex conditions.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit) is always used in conjunction with other immunosuppressive medications. Pre-medication with corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamines an hour before infusion is standard practice to minimize infusion reactions.  Prophylactic antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral medications are often also prescribed.

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific indication (transplant type, prophylaxis vs. treatment of rejection), patient factors (age, weight, other medical conditions), and the specific product formulation (dosage may differ between manufacturers).  Always refer to the prescribing information for the specific product being used.  The following are general guidelines and should not be considered definitive dosing instructions.  **Individualized dosing is crucial and should be determined by a qualified healthcare professional.**

**Adults:**

* **Kidney Transplant (Prophylaxis):** IV: 1.5 mg/kg/day for 4-7 days (first dose before kidney reperfusion), or alternative regimens may be used (e.g., 1.5 mg/kg once daily for 5-7 days, or 1 mg/kg once daily for 3-6 days).  Dosing may also be guided by peripheral blood CD3+ lymphocyte counts.

* **Kidney Transplant (Treatment of Acute Rejection):** IV: 1.5 mg/kg/day for 7-14 days.

* **Heart Transplant (Off-label):**  IV: Dosing varies depending on whether used for induction or treatment of acute rejection; ranges from 1-1.5 mg/kg once daily for up to 7 days for induction, and 0.75-1.5 mg/kg/day for 5-14 days for rejection treatment.

* **Lung Transplant (Off-label):**  IV: 1.5 mg/kg/day for 3 days (first dose within 24 hours of transplantation).


* **Other Transplant Types (Off-label):** Dosage varies widely depending on the transplant type and other medications used.  This should only be administered under the guidance of a specialist.

**Children:**

Pediatric dosing is largely extrapolated from adult dosing and is considered off-label in many situations. Safety and effectiveness haven't been fully established in children for most indications. Dosing is highly variable depending on the specific transplant type and clinical circumstances. The guidance for pediatric dosing in various transplant settings can range from 1-2mg/kg/day to a total dose of 5 mg/kg given in divided doses pre and post-operatively.  **This information is for illustrative purposes only and is not a substitute for consultation with a pediatric specialist.**


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer's labeling. However, dosage adjustments might be considered based on blood counts (WBC and platelets) in the context of renal transplantation.  For obese patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, actual body weight is used for mg/kg calculations, according to ASBMT guidelines.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit) is a polyclonal antibody derived from rabbit serum. It works by binding to specific antigens (proteins) on the surface of T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell crucial to the immune system's response. This binding leads to the depletion of these T-cells, suppressing the immune system's ability to attack the transplanted organ (or the patient's own cells in the case of aplastic anemia).  By reducing the immune response, the risk of organ rejection is lowered.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to rabbit proteins or any formulation component; active acute or chronic infection contraindicating further immunosuppression.

* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of serious infections, hematologic effects (low blood cell counts), hypersensitivity reactions (including life-threatening anaphylaxis), and malignancy.  Use with extreme caution in patients with existing infections or impaired immune systems.

* **Drug Interactions:** Many interactions are possible with other medications, particularly other immunosuppressants, vaccines (live vaccines are contraindicated), and certain biologics. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established.  Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.


* **Other Precautions:**  Careful monitoring of blood counts, signs of infection, and overall health are crucial during treatment. Infusion reactions can occur; therefore, slow intravenous administration with pre-medication is standard practice.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit) to work?** A: The onset of effect varies, depending on the indication and the individual. Immunosuppressive effects typically start to become noticeable within a few days to a week.


* **Q: How is Anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit) stored?** A: Refer to the specific product's labeling for detailed storage instructions. Typically, it requires refrigeration.


* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking immunosuppressants like Anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit) due to the increased risk of infection and potential interactions.  Consult your physician.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not try to "double up" on doses. Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on how to proceed.


* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking Anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (rabbit)?** A: Long-term effects can include an increased risk of infections and malignancies. Regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is necessary.
