# Amoxycillin + Clavulanic Acid

**Generic Name:** Amoxicillin/Clavulanate

**Usage:** Amoxicillin/Clavulanate is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  It's particularly effective against bacteria that have become resistant to amoxicillin alone.  Common uses include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, tonsillitis
* **Ear infections (otitis media):** Especially in children
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Cellulitis, abscesses
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**
* **Dental infections:**
* **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID):**  Often in conjunction with other treatments.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Amoxicillin/Clavulanate can cause side effects. These can range from mild to severe. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  These are often mild and resolve on their own.
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur (see below).
* **Headache:**
* **Vaginal yeast infection:** Due to disruption of normal gut flora.
* **Changes in taste:**
* **Nausea and vomiting:**

**Serious side effects, though less common, require immediate medical attention:**

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These can include hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).
* **Seizures:** More likely at high doses or in individuals with pre-existing seizure disorders.
* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):**  A severe form of diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria.
* **Liver problems:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Blood disorders:**  Although rare, changes in blood cell counts can occur.


**How it Works:**

Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that works by preventing bacteria from building their cell walls.  This leads to bacterial cell death.  Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Many bacteria produce beta-lactamases, enzymes that break down penicillin-type antibiotics rendering them ineffective. Clavulanic acid inhibits these enzymes, allowing the amoxicillin to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Amoxicillin/Clavulanate with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Amoxicillin/Clavulanate. Some interactions are possible.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long should I take Amoxicillin/Clavulanate?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better, as this can lead to recurrence of the infection or the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Mild side effects often resolve on their own.  Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects, especially severe allergic reactions, severe diarrhea, or signs of liver problems.

* **Q: Is Amoxicillin/Clavulanate safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  The safety of Amoxicillin/Clavulanate during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor.  Generally, the benefits may outweigh the risks in some cases, but individual assessment is necessary.
