# Asenapine
### Generic Name
Asenapine

### Usage

Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat:

*   **Acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder:** This means it helps manage the intense highs (mania) and mixed states of mania and depression characteristic of this condition.  It can be used alone or in combination with other mood stabilizers like lithium or valproate.
*   **Schizophrenia:** Asenapine helps control the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking) and, to a lesser extent, negative symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal).


### Dosage

Asenapine is available in two forms: sublingual tablets (dissolved under the tongue) and transdermal patches.  Dosage varies depending on the condition, the patient's age, and the medication form:


**Adults:**

*   **Schizophrenia (Sublingual):**  Initial dose is typically 5 mg twice daily (BID). This may be increased to 10 mg BID after a week, based on tolerance. The maximum dose is 10 mg BID.
*   **Bipolar I Disorder (Sublingual):**  Initial dose ranges from 5-10 mg BID.  The maintenance dose is usually the same as the acute-phase dose, potentially reduced to 5 mg BID depending on response and tolerance. The maximum dose is 10 mg BID.  Dosage for combination therapy (with lithium or valproate) starts at 5 mg BID and may increase to 10 mg BID.
*   **Bipolar I Disorder (Transdermal):**  Starts at 3.8mg/24-hour patch once daily (OD). This can increase to 5.7 mg/24-hour patch or 7.6 mg/24-hour patch after one week, based on response and tolerability.

**Children and Adolescents:**

*   **Bipolar I Disorder (Sublingual):** Asenapine is sometimes used in children aged 10 years and older and adolescents up to 17 years old for bipolar disorder.  The initial dose is typically 2.5 mg BID and can be increased cautiously to a maximum of 10mg BID.  The recommended daily range is 5-20 mg/day in two divided doses.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. It's contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
*   **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.


**Important Administration Notes:**

*   **Sublingual Tablets:**  Place tablets under the tongue and let them dissolve completely. Avoid eating or drinking for at least 10 minutes after administration.
*   **Transdermal Patches:** Apply one patch daily to clean, dry skin on the upper arm, back, abdomen, or hip.  Leave the patch on for 24 hours only.  Do not reuse application sites immediately.  Avoid heat sources near the patch.


### Side Effects

Asenapine, like other antipsychotics, can cause various side effects.  The frequency and severity can vary:


**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Drowsiness
*   Insomnia
*   Akathisia (restlessness)
*   Fatigue
*   Extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders)
*   Headache
*   Oral hypoesthesia (numbness in the mouth)
*   Weight gain
*   Increased triglycerides
*   Increased blood glucose
*   Decreased HDL cholesterol
*   Increased total cholesterol
*   Application site reactions (transdermal)
*   Increased creatine phosphokinase


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): A rare but life-threatening condition.  Symptoms include high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
*   Tardive dyskinesia:  A potentially irreversible movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements of the face, mouth, and extremities.
*   QT prolongation:  An abnormality in the heart's electrical activity that can increase the risk of serious heart rhythm problems.
*   Suicidal ideation: An increased risk of suicidal thoughts has been reported with antipsychotics.


If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

The exact mechanism of asenapine's action isn't fully understood. However, its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is likely related to its ability to block dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.  These receptors play a significant role in regulating mood, thought processes, and behavior. By blocking these receptors, asenapine helps to reduce the symptoms of these mental illnesses.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Asenapine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to asenapine or any component of the formulation and those with severe hepatic impairment.
*   **Interactions:** Asenapine can interact with other medications, particularly antihypertensives (enhancing their effects) and those metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Asenapine is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  The decision to use it during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made carefully, weighing the benefits against potential risks to the fetus or infant.
*   **Elderly Patients:**  Increased mortality risk in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.  Asenapine is not approved for this population.
*   **Patients with Cardiovascular Disease:**  Use with caution in individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease due to the risk of orthostatic hypotension and QT prolongation.
*   **Patients with Seizures:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions that lower the seizure threshold.
