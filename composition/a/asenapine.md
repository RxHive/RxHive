# Asenapine

**Generic Name:** Asenapine

**Usage:** Asenapine is an antipsychotic medication used to treat:

* **Schizophrenia:**  It helps to reduce hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking associated with schizophrenia.
* **Bipolar I disorder (acute manic or mixed episodes):** It helps to control the symptoms of mania, such as elevated mood, racing thoughts, and increased energy.  It's typically used as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers.

It's important to note that asenapine is typically *not* used for long-term maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.


**Side Effects:**  Like other antipsychotics, asenapine can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, increased appetite, blurred vision, somnolence (sleepiness).
* **More serious side effects:**  These are less common but require immediate medical attention.  They include:
    * **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
    * **Tardive dyskinesia (TD):**  A serious movement disorder that can be irreversible.  Symptoms include involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs.
    * **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):**  These include muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness, and difficulty with movement.
    * **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, which can lead to dizziness or fainting.
    * **QT prolongation:**  An increase in the QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), which can increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms.
    * **Increased risk of suicidal thoughts:**  Especially in young adults.
    * **Metabolic syndrome:**  A cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.


**How it Works:** Asenapine is a dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine and serotonin in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are thought to play a role in the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By blocking these receptors, asenapine helps to reduce the symptoms of psychosis and mania.  The exact mechanism by which it improves symptoms is not fully understood.
