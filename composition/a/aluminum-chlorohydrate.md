# Aluminum Chlorohydrate
### Generic Name
Aluminum Chlorohydrate

### Usage
Aluminum chlorohydrate is primarily used as an antiperspirant and astringent in topical dermatological preparations.  Its main application is in treating hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), particularly in the underarms.  The astringent properties also make it useful in some skincare products to reduce the appearance of pores and temporarily tighten the skin.  While not its primary function, some formulations may offer mild antiseptic properties.

### Dosage
Aluminum chlorohydrate doesn't have a dosage in the traditional sense like an oral medication. Its application is topical.  For antiperspirant use, apply a thin layer to clean, dry underarms after showering or bathing, typically at night before bed.  Allow the product to dry completely before dressing. The frequency of application depends on the product formulation and individual sweating levels; some products recommend daily application, while others may only need application every other day or even less frequently.  Always follow the specific instructions provided on the product label.  There are no specific dosage recommendations for children.  Use in children should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects
* **Common:** Skin irritation, redness, itching, rash at the application site.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis), although rare, are possible.  Some individuals may experience a burning or stinging sensation upon application.
* **Note:**  If you experience any adverse reactions, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Aluminum chlorohydrate works by temporarily blocking sweat ducts.  The aluminum salts in the compound interact with proteins in sweat, forming a plug-like substance within the sweat ducts.  This reduces the amount of sweat that reaches the skin's surface, providing the antiperspirant effect. The astringent action involves tightening the skin by causing mild protein coagulation, resulting in a temporarily reduced appearance of pores.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:** Avoid using products containing aluminum chlorohydrate if you have known allergies to aluminum or related compounds.
* **Skin Sensitivity:** Individuals with sensitive skin should test a small area before widespread application to check for any adverse reactions.
* **Broken Skin:** Do not apply to broken, irritated, or inflamed skin.
* **Interaction with other medications:** While generally not known to interact significantly with other medications, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are using, including over-the-counter products.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of aluminum chlorohydrate during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Consult your doctor before using it if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under the supervision of a pediatrician or healthcare professional.
