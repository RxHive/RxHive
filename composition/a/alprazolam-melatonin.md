# Alprazolam + Melatonin

There is no such thing as a generic combination drug of alprazolam and melatonin approved for marketing.  Alprazolam (Xanax) and melatonin are often prescribed separately, sometimes concurrently by a physician, but not as a single fixed-dose combination.  Therefore, the following information addresses each drug individually and then touches on the potential for concurrent use.

**Alprazolam (Generic Name):**

**Usage:**  Treatment of anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and sometimes short-term relief of insomnia.

**Side Effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, impaired coordination, memory problems, confusion, headache, constipation, nausea, changes in libido, and potential for dependence/withdrawal symptoms with long-term use or abrupt cessation.  Serious side effects are rare but include allergic reactions and suicidal thoughts (especially in individuals predisposed to such conditions).

**How it Works:** Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that enhances the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that inhibits brain activity. This leads to a calming effect.

**Melatonin (Generic Name):**

**Usage:**  Treatment of insomnia, particularly for circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (jet lag, shift work sleep disorder). It may also be used to treat other sleep disorders in some cases but requires physician approval.

**Side Effects:**  Drowsiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, daytime sleepiness, and rarely, vivid dreams or nightmares.  In rare cases, more serious reactions can occur.

**How it Works:** Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. It helps to promote sleep onset and improve sleep quality.

**Concurrent Use of Alprazolam and Melatonin:**

While a combined medication doesn't exist, doctors sometimes prescribe alprazolam and melatonin together for patients with severe insomnia or anxiety related sleep problems.  However, this requires careful monitoring due to the additive sedative effects.


**FAQs (regarding concurrent use):**

* **Q: Can I take alprazolam and melatonin together?** A:  Only if your doctor specifically prescribes both medications.  Never combine medications without professional guidance.
* **Q: What are the risks of taking both together?** A:  Increased drowsiness and sedation, impaired coordination, and increased risk of falls or accidents. It can also increase the risk of dependence on either or both medications.
* **Q: Is it safe to take them long-term?** A:  Long-term use of alprazolam carries risks of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Long-term use of melatonin needs further research, and chronic use should be guided by a physician.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately.
