# Ancrod
### Generic Name
Ancrod

### Usage
Ancrod is a defibrinogenating agent derived from the venom of the Malayan pit viper (*Calloselasma rhodostoma*).  Historically, it was used for the symptomatic treatment of moderate-to-severe peripheral arterial circulatory disorders. These disorders often result from long-term conditions like heavy smoking and arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), leading to reduced blood flow in the limbs.  Ancrod aimed to improve blood flow and alleviate symptoms associated with these conditions.  It's crucial to understand that Ancrod is currently **not approved or marketed for any medical use**.  Information provided here is for historical context and educational purposes only.

### Dosage
Because Ancrod is no longer approved for medical use, specific dosage recommendations are unavailable.  Historical data suggests that dosage varied depending on the patient's condition and response to treatment, and was administered intravenously.  Precise details on dosage and administration would only be found in outdated medical literature.

### Side Effects
Due to Ancrod's historical use and current unavailability, a comprehensive list of side effects cannot be definitively compiled. However, based on past reports, potential side effects may have included:

* Bleeding (this was a significant risk)
* Allergic reactions
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Other potential adverse events

It is important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects would have varied between patients.

### How it Works
Ancrod works by breaking down fibrinogen, a crucial protein in blood clotting.  By reducing fibrinogen levels, Ancrod indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation (clumping) and adhesion. This leads to decreased blood viscosity (thickness), improving blood flow, particularly in the affected arteries of patients with peripheral arterial circulatory disorders. The improved blood flow aimed to reduce pain, increase limb mobility, and lower the risk of thrombosis (blood clot formation).

### Precautions
Given Ancrod's discontinued status, comprehensive precaution information is limited. However, based on its mechanism of action, the most significant precaution would have been the risk of excessive bleeding.  Other potential precautions would have included:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Individuals with a history of allergies to snake venom or similar substances would likely have been at increased risk.
* **Drug interactions:**  Interactions with other anticoagulants (blood thinners) would have been a major concern.
* **Pregnant/Breastfeeding women:**  Use would have been strongly discouraged due to the risk to the fetus or infant.
* **Individuals with bleeding disorders:**  Ancrod would have been absolutely contraindicated.
