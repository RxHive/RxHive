# Acarbose

**Generic Name:** Acarbose

**Usage:** Acarbose is used to treat type 2 diabetes.  It's usually used in combination with diet and exercise to help control blood sugar levels.  It works by slowing down the digestion of carbohydrates, preventing a rapid rise in blood sugar after meals.  It's not typically used for type 1 diabetes.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects of acarbose are related to the gastrointestinal system. These include:

* **Gas:** This is often a significant side effect and can be quite uncomfortable.
* **Bloating:**  Feeling of fullness and distension in the abdomen.
* **Diarrhea:**  Loose or watery stools.
* **Abdominal pain or cramps:** Discomfort in the stomach area.
* **Flatulence:** Excessive gas production.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Liver problems:**  Although rare, liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported.  Regular liver function tests may be advised, especially in the initial stages of treatment.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, or difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. This means it works in the small intestine by blocking the enzymes (alpha-glucosidases) that break down complex carbohydrates (starches and sugars) into simpler sugars (glucose).  By slowing this breakdown, the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream is slowed, resulting in a more gradual and controlled rise in blood sugar after meals.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take acarbose with other diabetes medications?** A: Yes, acarbose is often prescribed along with other diabetes medications such as metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate combination and dosage.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: What should I eat while taking acarbose?** A: A balanced diet that is low in carbohydrates is essential when taking acarbose.  Your doctor or a registered dietitian can provide guidance on appropriate dietary changes.

* **Q: Can I take acarbose if I have liver or kidney problems?** A:  Acarbose use should be carefully considered in individuals with liver or kidney disease.  Your doctor will need to assess your condition before prescribing this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects such as allergic reactions, severe abdominal pain, or signs of liver problems (e.g., jaundice, dark urine).
