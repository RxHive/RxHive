# Acarbose
### Generic Name
Acarbose

### Usage
Acarbose is primarily used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  This means it works best when combined with lifestyle changes, not as a standalone treatment.  It's not used to treat type 1 diabetes.  Acarbose helps manage blood sugar levels by slowing down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates from the food you eat.  While its primary use is in type 2 diabetes, it also has off-label uses, such as managing postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (a condition of low blood sugar after meals) following gastric bypass surgery.  Use in these off-label situations should be under the close supervision of a doctor.


### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the individual's weight, response to treatment, and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

**Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Adults and Children ≥10 years):**

* **Initial Dose:** Typically starts at 25 mg three times a day (TID) with the first bite of each main meal.  Some may start with 25 mg once daily (OD), gradually increasing to TID based on tolerance.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  The dose is increased gradually, usually at 4-8 week intervals, to a maintenance dose of 50-100 mg TID, based on blood sugar levels and tolerance.  The maximum daily dose depends on weight: 50 mg TID if weight ≤60 kg; 100 mg TID if weight >60 kg.
* **Children:**  Dosage for children aged 10 years and older follows a similar pattern, starting at 25 mg TID and adjusted based on their response and weight.


**Off-label Use (Postprandial Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia):**

* The dose ranges from 25-100 mg TID, taken just before meals. If meals are more frequent, the dose may be divided into up to 6 smaller doses daily. This usage requires close monitoring and dietary adjustments.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Acarbose is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with cirrhosis.  Dosage adjustments for other forms of liver impairment are not specifically detailed in manufacturer's labeling.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with mild to moderate kidney disease (creatinine clearance ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m²). However, use is not recommended for patients with severe kidney disease (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min/1.73 m²), as blood levels of acarbose can significantly increase.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) are primarily gastrointestinal:

* Flatulence (gas)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain or discomfort

Less common, but still possible side effects include:

* Increased liver enzyme levels (transaminases)

Rare but serious side effects,  requiring immediate medical attention, have been reported:

* Intestinal obstruction
* Jaundice
* Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (air bubbles in the intestinal wall)
* Skin rash
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Edema (swelling)
* Erythema (redness)
* Hepatic injury or hepatitis


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Acarbose works by inhibiting enzymes (alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidases) responsible for breaking down complex carbohydrates in the digestive system. By slowing down this process, acarbose delays the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream, leading to a gentler rise in blood sugar levels after meals. This helps to improve blood sugar control, particularly the postprandial (after-meal) glucose spikes that are common in type 2 diabetes.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Acarbose is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to acarbose, diabetic ketoacidosis, cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction, or other conditions that could worsen with increased gas production.
* **Drug Interactions:** Acarbose can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their effectiveness or causing adverse effects. Discuss all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) with your doctor before starting acarbose.  Specific interactions include those with digoxin, hypoglycemic agents, and others.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Acarbose is a Category B pregnancy drug, meaning it hasn't shown harm in animal studies, but human studies are lacking. Other medications are generally preferred during pregnancy.  The excretion of acarbose in breast milk is unknown, so breastfeeding is usually not recommended.
* **Vulnerable Populations:** Older adults and individuals with kidney or liver problems require careful monitoring while taking acarbose.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take acarbose with other diabetes medications?** A: Yes, acarbose is often used in combination with other diabetes medications such as metformin, sulfonylureas, or insulin. Your doctor will determine the best combination for you.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store acarbose?** A: Store acarbose at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  What if I experience severe gastrointestinal side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe or persistent gastrointestinal issues, such as severe diarrhea or abdominal pain.  These could be signs of a more serious problem.

* **Q: Can I eat whatever I want while taking acarbose?** A:  Acarbose helps manage blood sugar but doesn't replace the need for a healthy diet and regular exercise.  While it helps with managing blood sugars after carbohydrate-rich meals, it's still crucial to follow a balanced diet plan as recommended by your healthcare professional.
