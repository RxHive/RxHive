# Anifrolumab
### Generic Name
Anifrolumab

### Usage
Anifrolumab is a prescription medication used to treat moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in adults.  SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues and organs. Anifrolumab helps manage the symptoms of SLE by modulating the immune response.  It's important to note that Anifrolumab's effectiveness hasn't been studied in patients with severe active lupus nephritis (kidney inflammation) or severe active central nervous system lupus.  Therefore, it's not recommended for use in these cases.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage for SLE is 300 mg administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every four weeks.  The medication is given as an infusion by a healthcare professional.  There are no specific dosage adjustments outlined for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  The safety and efficacy of Anifrolumab in children under 18 years old haven't been established.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections, and general infections.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include various infections (e.g., herpes zoster), cough, respiratory tract infections, hypersensitivity reactions, and the development of antibodies to the drug.  In rare cases (less than 1%), anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) and angioedema (swelling under the skin) have been reported.  There's also a potential increased risk of malignancy (cancer).  Infusion-related reactions can also occur.

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe reactions like anaphylaxis,  contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Anifrolumab is a type I interferon (IFN) receptor antagonist.  Type I IFNs are proteins involved in the body's immune response.  In SLE, an overactive type I IFN response contributes to inflammation and tissue damage. Anifrolumab works by binding to the type I interferon receptor, blocking the action of type I IFNs. This reduces inflammation and helps regulate the immune system.  It does this by inhibiting the signaling pathway triggered by type I interferons, thereby dampening the immune response and preventing the associated tissue damage.


### Precautions
Anifrolumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients who have had a previous anaphylactic reaction to Anifrolumab.  There is an increased risk of serious infections, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), malignancy, and infusion reactions.  The use of Anifrolumab with other biologic therapies hasn't been fully studied and is generally not recommended.  Patients should be up-to-date on their immunizations before starting treatment, and live or live-attenuated vaccines should be avoided during treatment.  While the drug's impact on pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully understood, it's known that human IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies, like Anifrolumab, can cross the placenta and may be present in breast milk.  Careful consideration of potential risks and benefits is crucial for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  Close monitoring for infections and hypersensitivity is essential during treatment.
