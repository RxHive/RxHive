# Amlodipine + Benazepril
### Generic Name
Amlodipine/Benazepril

### Usage

Amlodipine/Benazepril is a combination medication used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by combining two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, and benazepril, an ACE inhibitor.  The combination is often more effective than either drug alone in controlling blood pressure.  While primarily used for hypertension,  it may also be considered in patients with conditions that are worsened by high blood pressure, such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease, under the guidance of a physician. It's crucial to remember this medication should only be used under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.  They will assess your specific condition and determine if this combination is appropriate for you.

### Dosage

Dosage of Amlodipine/Benazepril is highly individualized and determined by your doctor based on your health status, blood pressure response, and other medications you may be taking. There isn't a universally applicable dosage for children; its use in children is generally not recommended.

**Adults (Oral):**  The typical starting dose is one tablet once daily. Your doctor may adjust the dosage based on your response to treatment. The available strengths vary, and your doctor will prescribe the appropriate strength.  It's important to take the medication at the same time each day, usually in the morning, to maintain consistent blood pressure control.

**Children (Oral):** Amlodipine/Benazepril is not typically prescribed for children.  Separate formulations of amlodipine and benazepril may be used in children under specific circumstances and with careful physician monitoring.

**IV Administration:** This combination medication is not available in an injectable (IV) form. Amlodipine and benazepril are available separately as IV medications, but they are administered and dosed differently and should only be given by a trained medical professional in a hospital or clinical setting.

**Important Note:** Never adjust your dosage without consulting your doctor.  Sudden changes in dosage can have serious consequences.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Swelling in ankles or feet
* Dry cough (more common with benazepril)
* Nausea


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema â€“ seek immediate medical attention)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Chest pain
* Shortness of breath
* Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice)
* Persistent cough or wheezing
* Muscle weakness or pain
* Elevated potassium levels


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Amlodipine/Benazepril lowers blood pressure through a two-pronged approach:

* **Amlodipine (Calcium Channel Blocker):** Relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow. This reduces the pressure against the vessel walls.

* **Benazepril (ACE Inhibitor):** Prevents the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, which causes blood vessels to narrow. By inhibiting angiotensin II, benazepril helps blood vessels relax and dilate, lowering blood pressure.


The combined action of these two drugs results in a more significant and sustained reduction in blood pressure than either drug alone would achieve.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with a history of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) related to ACE inhibitors.  It's also contraindicated in those who are severely allergic to either amlodipine or benazepril.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Amlodipine/Benazepril can interact with various medications, including potassium supplements, diuretics (water pills), and other blood pressure medications. Inform your doctor about all the medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters. It can also pass into breast milk and might affect the nursing infant. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking this medication if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to the side effects of this medication.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary.

* **Kidney and Liver Disease:**  Caution is advised in patients with kidney or liver disease, as the medication may need dose adjustments or may not be suitable at all.

* **Hyperkalemia:**  Benazepril can increase potassium levels in the blood (hyperkalemia), particularly in patients with kidney disease. Monitoring potassium levels is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Amlodipine/Benazepril suddenly?**  A: No, never stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a dangerous increase in blood pressure.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store Amlodipine/Benazepril?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Amlodipine/Benazepril?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can lower blood pressure excessively. Discuss alcohol consumption limits with your physician.

* **Q:  What if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of a severe allergic reaction, such as angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), difficulty breathing, or hives.
