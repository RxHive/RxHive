# Amlodipine + Benazepril

**Generic Name:** Amlodipine/Benazepril

**Usage:**

Amlodipine/Benazepril is a combination medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's often prescribed for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, and Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor.  By combining these two different types of blood pressure medication, the drug offers a synergistic effect, often achieving better blood pressure control than either drug alone.  This combination is primarily used to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular events in patients with high blood pressure.  It may also be prescribed for patients with specific types of heart disease or after a heart attack.  **Always consult a doctor before starting or changing any medications.**

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Amlodipine related:** Swelling in ankles or feet, headache, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, nausea.
* **Benazepril related:** Dry cough (a significant side effect for some), dizziness, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, changes in taste.
* **Less common but serious side effects:**  Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat),  low blood pressure (hypotension), kidney problems, changes in blood potassium levels, increased risk of falls (especially in the elderly).

It is crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and some individuals may experience other side effects. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Amlodipine and Benazepril work through different mechanisms to lower blood pressure:

* **Amlodipine (Calcium Channel Blocker):** Relaxes blood vessels by blocking the entry of calcium into the cells of blood vessel walls.  This causes the blood vessels to widen (vasodilation), reducing resistance to blood flow and lowering blood pressure.

* **Benazepril (ACE Inhibitor):** Blocks the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By inhibiting angiotensin II, benazepril relaxes blood vessels, decreases blood pressure, and reduces the workload on the heart.  It also helps the kidneys excrete sodium and water, further lowering blood pressure.


The combined effect of these two drugs leads to a more significant and sustained reduction in blood pressure than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Amlodipine/Benazepril?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so combining it with this medication may cause excessive blood pressure drops. It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure and potentially serious health consequences.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually tapering off the medication.

* **Can I take Amlodipine/Benazepril if I am pregnant or breastfeeding?**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking it.

* **What should I monitor while taking this medication?** Monitor your blood pressure regularly as instructed by your doctor.  Pay attention to any signs of side effects, especially swelling, cough, and dizziness.

* **What are the potential drug interactions?**  Many medications can interact with Amlodipine/Benazepril.  Be sure to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
