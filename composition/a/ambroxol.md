# Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol

**Usage:** Ambroxol is used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce mucus) associated with respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia.  It's also sometimes used to help loosen mucus and make it easier to cough up.  It's available in various forms like tablets, capsules, syrup, and solutions for inhalation.  The specific dosage and duration will depend on the individual's age, condition, and the doctor's prescription.

**Side Effects:**  Ambroxol is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach upset
* Dry mouth
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)  - Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.

More serious side effects are rare but possible and include:

* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, pale stools) - Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) - Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.


**How it Works:** Ambroxol is an expectorant.  It works by increasing the production of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant is a substance that helps reduce the surface tension of the mucus lining the airways, making it less viscous and easier to expel through coughing. It also stimulates the movement of cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the airways) to help clear mucus more effectively.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Ambroxol safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before using Ambroxol during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  While generally considered low-risk, the benefits must be weighed against potential risks to the developing baby or nursing infant.
* **Can I take Ambroxol with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of Ambroxol may vary depending on the individual, but you should start noticing improvement within a few days of starting treatment.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects usually resolve on their own. If side effects are bothersome or persistent, contact your doctor or pharmacist.  Seek immediate medical attention for serious side effects.
* **Can I stop taking Ambroxol when my cough improves?**  Continue taking Ambroxol as directed by your doctor even if your symptoms improve.  Stopping prematurely may lead to a recurrence of your symptoms.
