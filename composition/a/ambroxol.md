# Ambroxol
### Generic Name
Ambroxol

### Usage
Ambroxol is primarily used as a mucolytic agent to treat respiratory tract illnesses characterized by thick, sticky mucus.  This includes conditions such as acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis (part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD), and pneumonia.  It's also sometimes used to help relieve symptoms of a sore throat.  While not its primary function, ambroxol may aid in making coughs more productive by helping to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to expel.  In some instances, it's used perioperatively in COPD patients to help prevent post-surgical pulmonary complications.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation and route of administration.

* **Oral (Immediate-release):** 60-120 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses.
* **Oral (Extended-release):** 75 mg once daily.
* **Inhalation (Nebulization):** 15-22.5 mg (2-3 mL of a 7.5 mg/mL solution) once or twice daily.
* **Injection (IM, IV, SubQ):** 15-30 mg twice or three times daily.  This route is less common and usually reserved for specific situations.
* **Sore Throat Lozenges:** 20 mg (one lozenge) as needed, dissolved in the mouth; maximum of 6 lozenges per day, up to 3 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is determined by age and weight and often requires a healthcare professional's guidance.  It's crucial to follow the precise instructions provided by a doctor or pharmacist. Age-based and weight-based dosing guidelines exist, varying considerably based on the child's age and the specific condition being treated. For example, IV or IM administration in young children often uses different dosages based on weight (mg/kg/day). Specific instructions for infants and children must be obtained from a healthcare provider.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is advised, and a healthcare professional should be consulted.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nausea
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Oral hypoesthesia (numbness in the mouth)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Frequency not well-defined or <1%):**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Skin reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis)
* Gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, etc.)
* Central nervous system effects (numbness, paresthesia, chills, etc.)
* Respiratory issues (dyspnea, respiratory distress)

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Ambroxol works by increasing the secretion of pulmonary surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension in the alveoli (tiny air sacs in the lungs). This helps to loosen and thin the mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.  Ambroxol also increases the activity of cilia (tiny hair-like structures in the airways), which helps to move mucus out of the lungs.  In the case of lozenges, a local anesthetic and anti-inflammatory effect may also contribute to its relief of sore throat symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ambroxol is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to ambroxol or any of its components. Oral use is usually not recommended in children under 2 years old.
* **Increased Risk:** Ambroxol carries an increased risk of serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), and severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis).
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcers, hepatic or renal impairment, or those on a sodium-restricted diet.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Ambroxol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. It's generally advised to avoid use during the first trimester of pregnancy. Ambroxol is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ambroxol with other medications?** A:  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements. Some interactions are possible.
* **Q: How should I store ambroxol?** A: Store ambroxol as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is ambroxol habit-forming?** A: No, ambroxol is not considered habit-forming.
* **Q: Can I stop taking ambroxol when my symptoms improve?** A:  Always complete the full course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping early could lead to recurrence of symptoms.  If you have concerns, contact your doctor.
