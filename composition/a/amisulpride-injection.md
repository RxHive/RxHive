# Amisulpride (Injection)
### Generic Name
Amisulpride (Injection)

### Usage
Amisulpride injection is primarily used to prevent and treat postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).  Its main application is as a single-dose injection given either before or after surgery, depending on whether it's used for prevention or treatment of PONV.  It can be used alone or in combination with other antiemetic medications.  In cases where other antiemetic prophylaxis has failed, amisulpride injection is a valuable option for treating the nausea and vomiting that can occur following surgery.  It's crucial to note that this medication is specifically for PONV and is not intended for the treatment of other nausea or vomiting conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Prevention of PONV:** A single intravenous (IV) injection of 5 mg infused over 1-2 minutes at the time of anesthesia induction.
* **Treatment of PONV:** A single IV injection of 10 mg infused over 1-2 minutes if nausea and/or vomiting occur after surgery.

**Children:**

The safety and effectiveness of amisulpride injection in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. However, amisulpride injection should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Chills
* Procedural hypotension (low blood pressure during a procedure)
* Abdominal distention (swelling of the abdomen)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Increased serum prolactin levels (a hormone affecting milk production)
* Infusion-site pain

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) â€“ This is a serious cardiac effect and requires immediate medical attention.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Amisulpride is a selective antagonist of dopamine-2 (D2) and dopamine-3 (D3) receptors. These receptors are located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain. The CTZ plays a crucial role in triggering the vomiting reflex. By blocking these dopamine receptors, amisulpride prevents the activation of the vomiting center and thus reduces nausea and vomiting.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Amisulpride injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to amisulpride.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **QT Prolongation:** Amisulpride can prolong the QT interval on an ECG, increasing the risk of serious heart rhythm abnormalities.  Use caution in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), cardiac conduction disorders, electrolyte abnormalities (like hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, or those taking other medications that prolong the QT interval.  ECG monitoring may be recommended in such cases.
* **Drug Interactions:** Amisulpride may interact with dopamine agonists (like levodopa) and other drugs that prolong the QT interval.  Avoid concurrent use of amisulpride with droperidol.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Data on amisulpride use during pregnancy are limited.  If using during lactation, consider interrupting breastfeeding and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after administration to minimize infant exposure.
