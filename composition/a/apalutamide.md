# Apalutamide
### Generic Name
Apalutamide

### Usage
Apalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor used to treat prostate cancer.  Its primary use is in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCRPC), meaning the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and the body isn't producing enough testosterone to fuel its growth.  It's used in conjunction with continuous androgen deprivation therapy (hormone therapy).  A secondary use is in men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  In this case, the cancer hasn't spread, but it's still growing despite low testosterone levels. Again, it's combined with continuous androgen deprivation therapy.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage of apalutamide is 240 mg once daily by mouth. This is taken in conjunction with continuous androgen deprivation therapy, which may involve a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or bilateral orchiectomy (surgical removal of the testicles).  The dosage is the same for both metastatic castration-sensitive and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  

There is no established safe and effective dosage for children.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment aren't specifically outlined in manufacturer's labeling, but adjustments might not be necessary in cases of mild to moderate impairment. Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance in these situations. If significant side effects (Grade 3 or higher) occur, the dose may be reduced or temporarily stopped until the side effects lessen.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Fatigue
*   Falling
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)
*   Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
*   Decreased appetite
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Itching (pruritus)
*   Skin rash
*   Hot flashes
*   High cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia)
*   High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
*   High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
*   High triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia)
*   Changes in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels
*   Weight loss
*   Anemia
*   Low white blood cell count (leukopenia)
*   Low lymphocyte count (lymphocytopenia)
*   Joint pain (arthralgia)
*   Bone fractures


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

*   Seizures
*   Cerebrovascular events (strokes)
*   Ischemic heart disease
*   Cardiac failure
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a severe skin reaction)
*   Interstitial pulmonary disease (lung damage)


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Apalutamide is a selective androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor.  Androgens, like testosterone, are hormones that stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells by binding to and activating androgen receptors inside these cells. Apalutamide works by blocking the androgen receptors, preventing androgens from binding and thus halting the growth and spread of prostate cancer cells.  This leads to decreased tumor cell growth and increased cell death (apoptosis).


### Precautions
Apalutamide is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant due to the risk of fetal harm and potential loss.  Men of reproductive age should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the final dose.

Apalutamide increases the risk of falls and fractures, seizures, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events (including fatal ones), and dermatologic toxicities.  Patients with pre-existing seizure disorders should use apalutamide with caution.  The medication may also affect thyroid function and can interact with other drugs metabolized by specific liver enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, UGT) and transporter proteins (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1).  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting apalutamide.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take apalutamide with food?** A: Yes, apalutamide can be taken with or without food.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day and then continue with your regular schedule.
*   **Q: How should I store apalutamide?** A: Store apalutamide at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
*   **Q:  Can I drive while taking apalutamide?** A: Because of the risk of falls and dizziness, caution is advised while operating machinery or driving.
*   **Q:  Are there long-term effects from apalutamide?** A: Long-term effects will vary by individual and the duration of treatment.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.  Discuss any concerns with your doctor.
