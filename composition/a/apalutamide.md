# Apalutamide

**Generic Name:** Apalutamide

**Usage:** Apalutamide is an oral medication used to treat non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC).  This means it's used in men with prostate cancer that hasn't spread to other parts of the body but is still growing even after hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy) that lowers testosterone levels.  It's typically used in combination with androgen deprivation therapy.


**Side Effects:**  Apalutamide can cause a range of side effects, some common and some rare.  Common side effects include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or eruption.
* **Hot flashes:** Sudden sensations of warmth.
* **Decreased libido (sex drive):** Reduced interest in sex.
* **Erectile dysfunction:** Difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection.
* **Increased risk of falls:** Increased risk due to potential dizziness or weakness.

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Seizures:** Sudden, uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain.
* **Liver problems:** Elevated liver enzymes.  This requires monitoring liver function.
* **Serious skin reactions:** Such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
* **Pneumonia:** Lung infection.
* **Cardiovascular events:** Such as heart attack or stroke (though a causal link is not fully established).

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary from person to person.  It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Apalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen.  This means it works by blocking the effects of androgens (male hormones like testosterone) in prostate cancer cells.  Even after hormone therapy lowers testosterone levels, some prostate cancer cells can still be stimulated by androgens. Apalutamide blocks these remaining androgen receptors, thus helping to prevent the growth of prostate cancer cells.
