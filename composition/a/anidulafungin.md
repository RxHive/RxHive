# Anidulafungin

**Generic Name:** Anidulafungin

**Usage:** Anidulafungin is an antifungal medication used to treat serious fungal infections, specifically candidiasis (a yeast infection) and aspergillosis (a mold infection) in people who are already hospitalized.  It's usually reserved for cases where other antifungal medications haven't worked or aren't suitable.  Specific uses may include:

* Candidemia (Candida infection in the bloodstream)
* Invasive candidiasis
* Esophageal candidiasis
* Aspergillus infections (invasive aspergillosis) in patients who are already receiving other antifungal treatments

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, anidulafungin can cause side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Fever
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling at the injection site if administered intravenously)
* Rash

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity – monitor liver function tests)
* Low blood cell counts (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis in rare cases)
* Infusion-related reactions (if given intravenously)


**How it Works:** Anidulafungin is an echinocandin antifungal.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of β(1→3)-D-glucan, a crucial component of the fungal cell wall. By disrupting this process, anidulafungin weakens the fungal cell wall, leading to cell death and preventing the fungus from growing and spreading.
