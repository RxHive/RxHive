# Anidulafungin
### Generic Name
Anidulafungin

### Usage

Anidulafungin is an antifungal medication belonging to the echinocandin class.  Its primary use is in treating serious fungal infections caused by *Candida* species. This includes candidemia (Candida infection in the bloodstream), intra-abdominal candidiasis (infection within the abdominal cavity), and peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen).  In adults, it's also used to treat esophageal candidiasis (thrush in the esophagus).  While not officially approved for all *Candida* species infections, it is sometimes used off-label for infections caused by *Candida auris*, a particularly drug-resistant species.  Treatment decisions should always be made in consultation with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Candidemia, intra-abdominal abscess, or peritonitis:** A 200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily thereafter.  The duration of treatment is determined by the patient's response, but generally, it should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.
* **Esophageal Candidiasis:** A 100 mg IV infusion on day 1, followed by 50 mg daily. Treatment should last at least 14 days, or for seven days after symptoms resolve.  Due to relapse risk in HIV patients, suppressive therapy may be considered post-treatment.
* **Candida auris (off-label):**  A 200 mg IV infusion on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily.

**Pediatric Patients (≥1 month old):**

* **Candidemia, intra-abdominal abscess, or peritonitis:** An initial dose of 3 mg/kg given as a single IV infusion on day 1 (maximum 200 mg), followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg daily (maximum 100 mg). Treatment should last at least 14 days after the last positive culture.
* **Candida auris (off-label):**  Dosage recommendations are not explicitly established for pediatric patients with *Candida auris* infections and should be determined by a physician on a case-by-case basis.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Anidulafungin isn't removed by dialysis.

**Administration:** Anidulafungin is administered intravenously.  The infusion rate should not exceed 1.1 mg per minute.  It should not be mixed with other medications or electrolytes.

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Anidulafungin is a lipopeptide antifungal that works by inhibiting the synthesis of β-(1,3)-D-glucan, a vital component of the fungal cell wall. By interfering with the creation of this essential structural element, anidulafungin disrupts the integrity of the fungal cell wall, leading to cell death and ultimately suppressing the fungal infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Anidulafungin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to anidulafungin, other echinocandins, or any component of the formulation.  It is also contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected hereditary fructose intolerance.
* **Interactions:** While specific drug interactions are limited, it's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications (prescription and over-the-counter), supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Anidulafungin is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but human studies are lacking. Other antifungals are generally preferred for pregnant women.  It's unknown if anidulafungin is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Anidulafungin may cause liver damage. Liver function tests (LFTs) may be monitored.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions, such as bronchospasm, rash, or hypotension, can occur.  Slow infusion rates help mitigate this risk.
