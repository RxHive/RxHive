# Anthralin
### Generic Name
Anthralin (also known as Dithranol)

### Usage
Anthralin is primarily used topically to treat psoriasis, a chronic skin condition causing red, scaly patches.  It's particularly effective for plaque psoriasis, the most common type. While not a first-line treatment, it's often used when other treatments haven't been successful or for severe cases.  It's important to note that anthralin is a potent topical agent and its use should be closely supervised by a dermatologist.

### Dosage
Anthralin comes in various forms (creams, shampoos) with varying concentrations (typically 1% to 1.2%).  Dosage and application methods are highly individualized and depend on the severity of the psoriasis, the area affected, and the patient's tolerance.  A dermatologist will determine the appropriate concentration and application schedule.

**Adults:**

* **Psoriasis (Topical):**  Treatment begins with short contact times (5-10 minutes daily for at least one week), using the lowest effective concentration.  The contact time is gradually increased (up to 30 minutes) as tolerated.  The cream or shampoo is applied sparingly only to the psoriatic lesions, rubbed gently until absorbed, and then washed off.  For scalp psoriasis, special care is needed to avoid spreading the medication to the forehead and to thoroughly rinse the hair.

**Children:**

* **Scalp Psoriasis (Topical - Children â‰¥12 years):**  Anthralin shampoo (1%) may be used; application and rinse instructions are similar to adults.  Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended due to potential for irritation and staining.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, close monitoring is advised.


### Side Effects
Common side effects:

* Erythema (redness)
* Skin discoloration (temporary)
* Hair discoloration (temporary)
* Nail discoloration (temporary)
* Allergic contact sensitivity (rare)
* Transient irritation to uninvolved skin (especially with higher concentrations or longer contact times)

Serious but less common side effects are rare but include severe skin reactions.  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Anthralin works by slowing down the rapid growth of skin cells characteristic of psoriasis. It achieves this by interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis in the affected skin cells, reducing inflammation and scaling.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Anthralin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to anthralin or any formulation component and in cases of acute, actively inflamed psoriatic eruptions.
* **Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions are commonly reported.  However, it's crucial to inform your doctor or dermatologist about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are currently taking.
* **Warnings:** Anthralin can stain skin, hair, and fabrics permanently.  Use caution to avoid contact with unaffected skin, eyes, and clothing.  Patients with extensive psoriasis may experience increased redness and staining with prolonged or widespread application.  Petroleum jelly can be applied around the edges of lesions to protect healthy skin.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their physician before using anthralin.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The effectiveness of anthralin varies.  Some individuals may see improvement within a few weeks, while others may require longer treatment periods.
* **Q: Can I use anthralin on my face?** A:  Usually not, due to the increased risk of irritation and staining on the delicate facial skin. A dermatologist should guide application on the face, if at all necessary.
* **Q: How should I store anthralin?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get anthralin in my eyes?** A: Rinse your eyes immediately with plenty of cool water and seek medical attention if irritation persists.
* **Q: Is anthralin safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use may increase the risk of skin irritation and staining. A dermatologist should monitor usage.
