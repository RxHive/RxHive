# Allylestrenol
### Generic Name
Allylestrenol

### Usage
Allylestrenol is a synthetic progestin primarily used to prevent pregnancy complications. Its main applications include:

* **Threatened Miscarriage:**  It helps reduce the risk of miscarriage in pregnancies where there are signs of potential complications, such as bleeding or cramping.
* **Recurrent Miscarriage:** For women who have experienced multiple miscarriages, allylestrenol can be used to improve the chances of a successful pregnancy.
* **Premature Labor:**  While less common, it may be used to try and delay premature labor in some cases, although this use requires careful individual dosage adjustments.

It's crucial to understand that allylestrenol is not a cure for these conditions. Its effectiveness varies, and it's used in conjunction with other supportive measures recommended by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition and patient response.  It's always administered orally.

* **Threatened Miscarriage:** Typically 5 mg three times a day (TID) for 5-7 days.  The treatment duration might be extended if needed, with the dosage gradually reduced as symptoms improve.
* **Recurrent Miscarriage:**  The typical dosage is 5-10 mg per day, starting as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and continuing for at least a month past the period previously associated with miscarriage.
* **Premature Labor:** Dosage is highly individualized.  The maximum daily dose is 40 mg, but this should only be determined and managed by a physician.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of allylestrenol in children have not been established. It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for mild-to-moderate liver impairment, however, use should be cautious. It's contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are specified for patients with kidney problems, but use should be cautious.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Fever
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Depression
* Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, upset stomach)
* Changes in appetite or weight
* Fluid retention and edema
* Acne
* Skin rash (urticaria)
* Breast changes
* Hirsutism (excessive hair growth)
* Changes in libido (sex drive)
* Menstrual cycle irregularities and bleeding

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects can include visual disturbances (vision loss, proptosis, diplopia).  Any concerning side effects should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Allylestrenol is a synthetic progestin that works by binding to progesterone receptors in the body.  This interaction promotes the transformation of the uterine lining (endometrium) from a proliferative state to a secretory one, crucial for supporting a pregnancy.  It also affects the release of gonadotropins (hormones influencing ovulation) and follicle maturation in the ovaries, thus potentially reducing the risk of miscarriage or premature labor.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Allylestrenol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, thrombophlebitis (blood clot formation in a vein), undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, hormone-dependent cancers, cerebral apoplexy (stroke), incomplete abortion, severe liver impairment, and pregnancy.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with enzyme-inducing drugs (carbamazepine, griseofulvin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin) should be avoided due to potentially reduced allylestrenol effectiveness. Ketoconazole and ciclosporin interactions also necessitate careful consideration and avoidance of concurrent use due to potential increased concentrations.
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of visual disturbances has been noted. Use with caution in patients with embolic disorders, migraine, depression, diabetes mellitus, and conditions potentially worsened by fluid retention.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Allylestrenol is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended.

### FAQs

* **Can I take Allylestrenol with food?**  While not strictly necessary, taking it with food may help reduce stomach upset.
* **What should I avoid while taking Allylestrenol?**  Avoid hazardous activities and abrupt cessation of the drug.
* **Is Allylestrenol a pregnancy test?** No, it should not be used to confirm or diagnose pregnancy.
* **What if I experience side effects?** Consult your doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.
* **How should I store Allylestrenol?** Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.
