# Aminolevulinic Acid (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Aminolevulinic Acid (Systemic)

### Usage
Aminolevulinic acid (systemic) is used as an adjunct to visualize malignant tissue during surgery for patients with gliomas (suspected WHO grade III or IV based on preoperative imaging).  It's a crucial tool to help surgeons more precisely identify and remove cancerous brain tissue during surgery, improving the chances of complete tumor resection.  This is its primary and currently only approved use.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For glioma, the recommended dose is 20 mg/kg administered orally 3 hours (range: 2-4 hours) before the start of anesthesia.  The medication must be reconstituted by a healthcare provider before administration.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of aminolevulinic acid in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. While clearance may be reduced in patients with either condition, the necessity of dosage adjustment is not known.


### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Headache, aphasia, hemiparesis, hemiplegia, seizures, hypoesthesia.
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting.
* Endocrine and metabolic: Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels.
* Hepatic: Increased serum ALT levels.
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Monoplegia.
* Ophthalmic: Hemianopia.
* Other: Fever.

**Less Common (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Nervous system: Ataxia
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension
* Other: Abnormal hepatic function tests, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, cerebral edema, chills, diarrhea, erythema, fixed drug eruption, metabolic acidosis, skin photosensitivity, solar dermatitis, urticaria.


**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a naturally occurring metabolic intermediate. When administered systemically, it accumulates in tumor cells, leading to the production of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). PpIX fluoresces when exposed to specific wavelengths of blue light. During surgery, a special operating microscope with blue light illumination and filters allows surgeons to see the tumor tissue glowing red against the surrounding healthy tissue (which appears blue), providing enhanced visualization for more precise surgical removal.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to aminolevulinic acid, porphyrins, or any component of the formulation.
* Acute or chronic porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting porphyrin metabolism).

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of phototoxic reactions.  Avoid other photosensitizing medications for 24 hours before and after administration.
* Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis).  Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be readily available.
* The use of aminolevulinic acid may lead to errors in intraoperative visualization, including false positives and false negatives.  Non-fluorescence does not rule out the presence of tumor. Fluorescence can be seen in areas of inflammation or metastases from other cancer types.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  There is no human data on the use of systemic aminolevulinic acid in pregnancy. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.  The benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against potential risks to the infant.  To minimize infant exposure, mothers should pump and discard breast milk for 24 hours after administration.

### FAQs

**Q: How is aminolevulinic acid administered?**

A: It's given orally as a solution that must be reconstituted by a healthcare provider.

**Q:  How long does it take to work?**

A: It's administered 2-4 hours before surgery to allow sufficient time for PpIX accumulation in tumor cells.

**Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects, especially serious ones.

**Q: How should aminolevulinic acid be stored?**

A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

**Q: Is aminolevulinic acid safe for everyone?**

A: No, it is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or porphyria.  It's crucial to discuss any pre-existing health conditions with your doctor before use.

**Q: What is the role of blue light in this treatment?**

A:  The blue light excites the PpIX in the tumor cells, causing them to fluoresce and become visible to the surgeon.
