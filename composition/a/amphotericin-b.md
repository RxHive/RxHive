# Amphotericin B

**Generic Name:** Amphotericin B

**Usage:** Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication used to treat serious fungal infections that are resistant to other treatments.  These infections can affect various parts of the body, including:

* **Systemic mycoses:**  Severe fungal infections affecting internal organs, such as the lungs, brain, kidneys, and heart.  Examples include candidiasis (a yeast infection), aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis.
* **Meningitis:** Fungal infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
* **Visceral leishmaniasis:** A parasitic infection affecting internal organs.


**Side Effects:** Amphotericin B can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and others severe.  These can include:

* **Infusion-related reactions:** Fever, chills, rigors (shaking chills), nausea, vomiting, headache, and hypotension (low blood pressure).  These are often managed by pre-treating with antipyretics (fever reducers) and other medications.
* **Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity):** This is a serious side effect that can lead to decreased urine production, electrolyte imbalances, and kidney failure.  Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor kidney function.
* **Liver problems (hepatotoxicity):** Less common than nephrotoxicity, but can still occur.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Changes in levels of potassium, magnesium, and calcium in the blood.
* **Anemia:** Decreased red blood cell count.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can lead to dizziness and fainting.
* **Cardiac arrhythmias:** Irregular heartbeats.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives.


**How it Works:** Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal agent.  It works by binding to ergosterol, a component of the fungal cell membrane. This binding disrupts the cell membrane's integrity, causing leakage of essential cell contents and ultimately leading to fungal cell death.  Human cells have cholesterol instead of ergosterol, which is why Amphotericin B is relatively more toxic to fungal cells.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Amphotericin B safe?** Amphotericin B can be effective but has significant potential side effects, especially nephrotoxicity.  Its use is reserved for serious fungal infections that don't respond to less toxic alternatives.  Close monitoring by a medical professional is essential.

* **How is Amphotericin B administered?** It can be given intravenously (IV) or, less commonly, intrathecally (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid) or topically (for localized infections).  The IV formulation is most commonly used for systemic infections.

* **Are there different formulations of Amphotericin B?** Yes, there are liposomal formulations (like liposomal amphotericin B) and lipid complex formulations (like Abelcet) which are designed to reduce nephrotoxicity compared to the conventional "deoxycholate" formulation.

* **What are the monitoring requirements?**  Regular blood tests (especially kidney function tests, electrolyte levels), urine output monitoring, and close observation for infusion-related reactions are necessary.

* **What are the drug interactions?** Amphotericin B can interact with several other medications, so it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Can I take Amphotericin B during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks to the mother and/or child.  Close monitoring is essential.
