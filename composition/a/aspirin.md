# Aspirin
### Generic Name
Aspirin

### Usage

Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with multiple uses.  Its primary uses are for the temporary relief of mild to moderate pain (such as headache, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, and toothaches) and fever associated with colds or the flu.  Aspirin also reduces inflammation.  

Beyond its over-the-counter uses, aspirin plays a crucial role in preventing cardiovascular events.  It's prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death in individuals with a history of these events or those at high risk. Aspirin's antiplatelet properties, which prevent blood clots, are central to this cardiovascular protective effect. It's also used in some cases after certain heart procedures (such as coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty) to prevent clot formation.  Other off-label uses include management of certain types of arthritis, acute pericarditis, and the prevention of pre-eclampsia in high-risk pregnancies.


### Dosage

Aspirin dosage varies significantly depending on the reason for its use and the patient's characteristics.  Always follow your doctor's prescription or the instructions on the over-the-counter packaging.

**Adult Dosage (Immediate-Release):**

* **Pain and Fever Relief:** 325 mg to 1000 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 4000 mg per day.
* **Arthritis (Anti-inflammatory):** 4000-8000 mg per day, divided into 4-5 doses.  This high dose should only be used under medical supervision due to potential side effects.
* **Cardiovascular Prevention (Low-Dose):** Typically 75-100 mg once daily. This is usually a low-dose aspirin tablet, often enteric-coated to reduce stomach upset.
* **Acute Coronary Syndromes (Initial):**  A higher initial dose (162-325 mg) is often given, usually chewed and swallowed immediately. This is followed by a lower maintenance dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Aspirin should generally be avoided in children and teenagers, especially those with viral illnesses like chickenpox or influenza due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious condition.  If a doctor prescribes aspirin for a child, the dosage will be carefully determined based on the child's weight and medical condition.  Always consult a healthcare professional before giving aspirin to a child.


**Dosage Forms:** Aspirin comes in various forms, including tablets (immediate-release and extended-release), capsules, and rectal suppositories.  The choice of form depends on the individual's needs and the doctor's instructions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of aspirin can include:

* Upset stomach
* Heartburn
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding (this can be severe)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from rash to anaphylaxis)
* Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
* Hearing loss
* Kidney problems


If you experience any concerning side effects, such as persistent stomach pain, blood in your stool or vomit, severe allergic reaction, or any other unusual symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Aspirin works by inhibiting enzymes called cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). These enzymes are involved in the production of substances called prostaglandins, which contribute to pain, fever, inflammation, and blood clotting. By inhibiting COX enzymes, aspirin reduces these effects.  Specifically, its irreversible inhibition of COX-1 in platelets prevents blood clot formation, leading to its cardiovascular protective effects.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Aspirin should be avoided by individuals with allergies to aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* **Bleeding Disorders:** Aspirin increases the risk of bleeding and should be used cautiously, or avoided entirely, in individuals with bleeding disorders or those taking blood-thinning medications.
* **Pregnancy:** Aspirin is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, unless specifically prescribed by a doctor for a particular condition (e.g., prevention of pre-eclampsia in high-risk pregnancies).
* **Children:**  Avoid aspirin in children and teenagers due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.
* **Other Medications:** Aspirin can interact with other medications, such as blood thinners, methotrexate, and some diabetes medications. Always inform your doctor of all the medications and supplements you're taking.
* **Stomach Problems:** Aspirin can irritate the stomach lining and increase the risk of ulcers and bleeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take aspirin with alcohol?** A: It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol consumption around the time you take aspirin, as it can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.

* **Q: How should I store aspirin?** A: Store aspirin in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: How long does aspirin last?** A: The duration of aspirin's effects depends on the dose and the reason for taking it. For pain and fever relief, the effects are usually temporary. For cardiovascular prevention, the medication needs to be taken consistently as prescribed.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of aspirin?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
