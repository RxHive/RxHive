# Articaine + Adrenaline [Epinephrine]
### Generic Name
Articaine + Adrenaline (Epinephrine)

### Usage

Articaine hydrochloride and epinephrine is a local anesthetic used primarily in dentistry.  It provides local anesthesia for various dental procedures, both simple and complex. This combination uses articaine, an amide-type local anesthetic, to numb the area, and epinephrine, a vasoconstrictor, to reduce bleeding and prolong the anesthetic effect.  It's administered via injection, typically by infiltration (into the tissues surrounding the treatment area) or nerve block (to block a specific nerve).  While primarily used in dentistry,  its use is limited to dental procedures due to its formulation and administration route.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage depends on the type of procedure (infiltration, nerve block, oral surgery) and the concentration of epinephrine used (1:100,000 or 1:200,000).  Generally, for infiltration and nerve blocks, 0.5-3.4 mL of a 4% articaine solution with epinephrine may be used, with a maximum total dose of articaine not exceeding 7 mg/kg body weight (0.175 mL/kg of a 4% solution).  For oral surgery, slightly higher doses (1-5.1 mL) may be used, but the maximum dose of articaine remains at 7 mg/kg.  The 1:200,000 epinephrine concentration is generally preferred unless hemostasis (reduction of bleeding) is critical.  Dosage should be reduced in patients with cardiac disease or those who are acutely ill or debilitated.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and effectiveness in children under 4 years of age have not been established. For children 4 years and older, dosing is based on weight (mg/kg) using a 4% articaine solution with epinephrine.  The maximum dose remains 7 mg/kg of articaine.  Specific doses vary depending on procedure complexity and are typically lower than adult doses.  Adolescents 17 years and older receive the same adult dose.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, caution is advised in patients with severe hepatic disease.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Pain at the injection site
* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Facial edema (swelling)
* Gingivitis (gum inflammation)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Cardiac insufficiency (heart failure)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Injection site reactions (including tissue necrosis)
* Asthma (in susceptible individuals)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.  A comprehensive list of less frequent side effects reported includes abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and others.  


### How it Works

Articaine blocks nerve signals by binding to sodium channels in nerve cell membranes.  This prevents the transmission of pain signals to the brain, causing local anesthesia.  Epinephrine, a vasoconstrictor, narrows blood vessels at the injection site. This reduces blood flow, prolonging the duration of articaine's effect and minimizing bleeding during the procedure.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Articaine + Epinephrine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to articaine, epinephrine, or any component of the formulation.
* Patients hypersensitive to sulfites.
* Allergies to dental anesthetics.
* Inflammation or sepsis near the injection site.
* Severe shock, paroxysmal tachycardia, frequent arrhythmias, neurological disease, severe hypertension.
* Children under 4 years of age.
* Severe heart disease, heart block, or known arrhythmias.
* Recent myocardial infarction (<6 months) or coronary artery bypass surgery (<3 months).
* Concurrent use of certain medications (non-cardioselective beta-blockers, TCAs, MAO inhibitors, ergot derivatives, and halothane).
* Narrow-angle glaucoma, bronchial asthma, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, or severe hepatic/renal insufficiency.

**Interactions:**  Avoid concomitant use with MAO inhibitors, non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists, or TCAs due to potential for increased hypertension.  Use with caution with phenothiazines and butyrophenones as they may reduce epinephrine's pressor effect.

**Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with impaired cardiovascular function, elderly patients, breastfeeding women, and patients with severe hepatic disease. Intravascular injection should be strictly avoided.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does the numbness last?**

A: The duration of numbness varies depending on the dose, injection site, and individual patient factors, typically lasting from 30 minutes to several hours.

**Q: Can I drive after receiving this injection?**

A: It's advisable to avoid driving until the numbness has completely subsided to ensure safe operation of a vehicle.

**Q:  What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?**

A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of an allergic reaction such as swelling, rash, difficulty breathing, or dizziness.

**Q: How should I store Articaine + Epinephrine?**

A: Store as directed by your dentist or pharmacist, typically at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

**Q:  Is it safe to use during pregnancy?**

A: Use during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against potential risks. Consult your dentist and healthcare provider before using this medication.

**Q: Is it safe to breastfeed after receiving this injection?**

A: While excretion in breast milk is not fully known, caution is advised. Consult your healthcare provider.  Consider pumping and discarding breast milk for approximately 4 hours post-injection.
