# Acrivastine
### Generic Name
Acrivastine

### Usage
Acrivastine is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).  It works by blocking histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions that causes symptoms like sneezing, itching, runny nose, and rash.  While its main application is in treating allergic symptoms, it's specifically targeted at the relief of these symptoms and doesn't address the underlying cause of the allergy itself.

### Dosage

**Adults (12 years and older):** For allergic rhinitis and urticaria, the usual dose is 8 mg taken up to four times daily, as needed.  The maximum daily dose is 24 mg.  Acrivastine is typically available as an oral tablet.

**Children (under 12 years):** The safety and efficacy of acrivastine have not been established in children under 12 years of age.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer for patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is provided for mild to moderate renal impairment, but use should be cautious.  Acrivastine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Drowsiness


**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dry mouth (xerostomia)


**Rare Side Effects (frequency not defined):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Skin rash
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including shortness of breath (dyspnea) and facial swelling (edema)).


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are serious or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Acrivastine is a second-generation histamine H1 antagonist.  Histamine, released during allergic reactions, binds to H1 receptors on cells, triggering the inflammatory response that causes allergy symptoms. Acrivastine works by selectively blocking these H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and thus reducing the allergic response.  Importantly, it has minimal anticholinergic effects (meaning it doesn't significantly affect other systems in the body like the gastrointestinal tract) and limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, reducing the likelihood of central nervous system side effects compared to some older antihistamines.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Acrivastine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to acrivastine, triprolidine, or any component of the formulation, and in those with severe renal impairment.

* **Interactions:**  Acrivastine may interact with other medications, particularly those with central nervous system depressant effects or anticholinergic effects. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Specific examples of interactions to avoid are noted in the detailed product information.

* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with renal impairment and in those performing tasks requiring alertness (e.g., driving, operating machinery) as drowsiness is a possible side effect.  The safety of acrivastine during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.

* **Special Populations:** Avoid use in elderly patients and in patients with galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption.
