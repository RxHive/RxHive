# Aminophylline

**Generic Name:** Aminophylline

**Usage:**

Aminophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat and prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases.  It's also used to treat apnea of prematurity (a breathing problem in premature infants).  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) or rectally, though oral formulations exist and are used less frequently.  The choice of administration route depends on the severity of symptoms and the patient's condition.  It's important to note that aminophylline is often used as a second-line treatment or in cases where other bronchodilators are ineffective.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of aminophylline can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Headache
* Restlessness
* Insomnia
* Dizziness
* Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)

More serious, though less common, side effects can include:

* Seizures
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Dehydration


**How it Works:**

Aminophylline works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs. This makes it easier to breathe.  It achieves this effect by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  Increased cAMP levels lead to smooth muscle relaxation in the bronchi, thus widening the airways.  Aminophylline also has other effects, such as reducing inflammation and increasing the activity of the diaphragm.
