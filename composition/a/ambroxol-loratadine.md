# Ambroxol + Loratadine

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Loratadine (This is a combination not usually found as a single branded product, but rather as two separate medications combined by a doctor)

**Usage:** This combination is not a standard pre-made medication.  Doctors might prescribe Ambroxol and Loratadine together to treat symptoms of a specific condition involving both respiratory congestion and allergies. This often includes conditions like:

* **Allergic Bronchitis:** Where allergic reactions cause inflammation and mucus production in the bronchi. The Ambroxol helps loosen and thin the mucus, while Loratadine reduces allergic inflammation.
* **Cold with Allergic Component:** Where a common cold is accompanied by allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.

**It's crucial to understand that this is not a standard over-the-counter combination and should only be used as directed by a physician.**

**Side Effects:** The side effects listed below are a combination of potential side effects from both Ambroxol and Loratadine.  The likelihood and severity vary depending on the dosage and individual patient.

* **Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, dizziness. Rarely, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* **Loratadine:** Drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, stomach upset. Rarely, more serious allergic reactions.

**How it Works:**

* **Ambroxol:** Acts as a mucolytic agent. It helps to thin and loosen the mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.  It does this by increasing the production of surfactant in the lungs.
* **Loratadine:** Is a non-sedating antihistamine. It blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes many of the symptoms of allergies like sneezing, runny nose, itching, and watery eyes.
