# Aluminium Glycinate
### Generic Name
Aluminium Glycinate (also known as Dihydroxyaluminium Aminoacetate)

### Usage
Aluminium glycinate is primarily used as an antacid to relieve the symptoms associated with excess stomach acid.  This includes heartburn, indigestion, acid reflux, and the discomfort caused by ulcers. It can also provide relief from flatulence (gas).  It's important to note that while it can provide symptomatic relief, it doesn't treat the underlying cause of these conditions.  For example, it will relieve heartburn but won't cure a peptic ulcer.  Consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (tablet, suspension, etc.), the severity of symptoms, and the individual's age and overall health.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally, for adults, the typical dose is one or two tablets or a specified amount of suspension, taken as needed, usually after meals or at bedtime.  Children's dosage should always be determined by a pediatrician and is typically lower than adult dosages.  Never exceed the recommended dosage.  Instructions for different formulations will be specified on the product label.  If unsure, seek clarification from a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Constipation
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting

Less common, but more serious side effects, although rare, can include:

* Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels in the blood) – This is particularly a concern with long-term use.
* Neurological symptoms (e.g., confusion, dementia) – More likely with prolonged use in individuals with impaired kidney function.
* Aluminum toxicity (rare, usually associated with long-term, high-dose use in patients with kidney problems).

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Aluminium glycinate acts as an antacid by neutralizing stomach acid.  It works by reacting chemically with hydrochloric acid (the acid in your stomach), forming a less acidic salt, thus raising the pH of the stomach contents.  This reduces the acidity that causes heartburn and other symptoms associated with excess stomach acid.  By neutralizing the acid, it also inhibits the activity of pepsin, an enzyme that helps digest proteins and can contribute to ulcer formation.


### Precautions
* **Kidney disease:** Individuals with kidney problems should exercise extreme caution when using aluminium glycinate, as the body may have difficulty eliminating the aluminum. Long-term use may lead to aluminum accumulation.
* **Phosphate levels:**  Long-term use can potentially lower phosphate levels in the blood (hypophosphatemia).  Regular monitoring may be necessary.
* **Drug interactions:**  While generally safe, it's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to check for potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using aluminium glycinate if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.  The safety of using this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.
* **Children:**  Always consult a pediatrician before giving aluminium glycinate to children.  Dosage and safety in children should be carefully assessed.
* **Elderly:** The elderly may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly constipation.  Monitoring is crucial.
