# Azelastine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Azelastine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Azelastine ophthalmic solution is primarily used to relieve the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye) caused by an allergic reaction, such as pollen, pet dander, or dust mites.  This medication targets the itching, a key symptom of this condition.  It's important to note that azelastine ophthalmic doesn't treat other symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis like redness or swelling, although it may provide some indirect relief by reducing itching.

### Dosage

**Adults (Seasonal and Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis):**  Instill one drop of a 0.05% solution (500 mcg/drop) into the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID).

**Children (Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis):** For children aged 3 years and older, instill one drop of a 0.05% solution (15 mcg/drop â€“ note the difference in concentration from adult dosage) into the affected eye(s) twice daily.

**Children (Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis):** For children aged 12 years and older, instill one drop of a 0.05% solution (15 mcg/drop) into the affected eye(s) twice daily.


**Important Administration Guidelines:**

* Remove contact lenses before administration and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting. Avoid using contact lenses if your eyes are red.
* Do not touch the tip of the container to any surface, your eyelids, or surrounding areas to prevent contamination.
* After instillation, gently press on the inner corner of your eye (lacrimal sac) for about one minute, or instruct the child to gently close their eyelid, to minimize systemic absorption.

### How it Works

Azelastine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing itching and other symptoms. Azelastine works by blocking histamine receptors, preventing histamine from triggering these reactions.  Additionally, it inhibits other inflammatory mediators involved in allergic responses, contributing to the overall reduction of allergic symptoms.
