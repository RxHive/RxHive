# Amineptine
### Generic Name
Amineptine

### Usage
Amineptine is a tricyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat depression.  It's typically reserved for patients who haven't responded well to, or are intolerant of, other antidepressant treatments.  Its use is considered off-label in many regions due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Depression):**  The typical oral dosage is 100 mg twice daily (BID).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of amineptine in children have not been established, and it's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with these conditions.  Amineptine is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in patients with severe liver disease.

### Side Effects
Amineptine can cause a range of side effects, although the frequency of each isn't clearly defined in available literature.  These can include:

* Acne
* Nervousness
* Irritability
* Insomnia
* Confusion
* Delirium
* Suicidal ideation (thoughts of self-harm)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Vasomotor episodes (changes in blood vessel tone)
* Postural hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Palpitations
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction)

More serious, though less common, side effects are possible.  If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Amineptine is a tricyclic antidepressant that works by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine in the brain.  This increased availability of these neurotransmitters helps to alleviate the symptoms of depression.  Dopamine is associated with reward, motivation, and pleasure, while norepinephrine plays a role in alertness and arousal.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Amineptine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to amineptine or any formulation component
* Chorea (a neurological disorder causing involuntary movements)
* Concurrent use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
* Recent myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
* Severe liver disease
* Manic phase of bipolar disorder
* Porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme synthesis)
* Lactation (breastfeeding)


**Warnings & Use with Caution:**

* Increased risk of drug dependence/abuse and suicidal tendencies.
* Use with caution in patients with neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease, a history of epilepsy, urinary retention, or diabetes mellitus.
* Caution is advised when used concurrently with general anesthetics or electroconvulsive therapy.


**Pregnancy & Lactation:** Amineptine's category during pregnancy is unknown. Use is not recommended during the first trimester, and excretion in breast milk is also unknown.  It is contraindicated in breastfeeding mothers.
