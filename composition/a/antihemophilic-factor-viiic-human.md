# Antihemophilic Factor VIIIC Human
### Generic Name
Antihemophilic Factor VIIIC Human

### Usage
Antihemophilic Factor VIIIC Human is a crucial medication used in the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in individuals with hemophilia A (classic hemophilia).  Its primary use is to replace the missing or deficient clotting factor VIII, which is essential for proper blood clotting.  This medication is also used in the perioperative management of hemophilia A patients, helping to minimize bleeding risks during and after surgical procedures.

### Dosage
Dosage of Antihemophilic Factor VIIIC Human is determined by several factors, including the severity of the bleeding episode, the patient's weight, and their individual response to the medication.  Dosage is expressed in International Units (IU) per kilogram (kg) of body weight.  The medication is administered intravenously (IV).  Precise dosage guidelines vary depending on the type and severity of the bleeding event.  Consult the prescribing information for detailed, situation-specific guidelines.

**Adult and Pediatric Dosage (General Examples):**  The following are examples and should not be taken as precise instructions.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage:

* **Minor Hemorrhage:**  A loading dose of approximately 15 IU/kg may be given initially, followed by a maintenance dose of half the loading dose every 12-24 hours as needed.
* **Moderate Hemorrhage/Minor Surgery:** A loading dose of around 25 IU/kg might be administered, followed by maintenance doses of 15 IU/kg every 8-12 hours to maintain adequate clotting levels.
* **Severe Hemorrhage/Major Surgery:** Higher loading doses (40-50 IU/kg) may be necessary, followed by frequent maintenance doses to keep factor VIII levels sufficiently high.

**Important Note:**  The specific dosage and frequency will be individualized by a physician based on the patient's condition, response to treatment, and other health factors.  Children's dosing will be adjusted according to their weight and the severity of their bleeding episode. Always follow the physician's instructions and adhere to the specific dosage regimen provided.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include headache, drowsiness (somnolence), lethargy, fever, blurred vision, chills, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), nausea, vomiting, and reactions at the infusion site such as stinging or itching.  In rare cases, more serious allergic reactions like anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) and hives (urticaria) can occur.


### How it Works
Antihemophilic Factor VIIIC Human works by replacing the missing or deficient clotting factor VIII in individuals with hemophilia A. Factor VIII is a crucial protein involved in the blood clotting cascade.  By supplementing this factor, the medication helps the blood to clot normally, preventing or stopping bleeding episodes.  The factor VIII works in conjunction with other clotting factors to form a stable blood clot.


### Precautions
* **Allergies:**  This medication should not be used in patients with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to Antihemophilic Factor VIIIC Human or any of its components.
* **Inhibitors:** Some patients develop inhibitors (antibodies) against factor VIII, which can reduce the effectiveness of treatment.  Regular monitoring for inhibitors is necessary in such cases.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  Its use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks. The excretion of factor VIII in breast milk is uncertain; caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your healthcare provider of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, that you are taking.  Interactions with other drugs may occur.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  There's currently no specific dosage adjustment recommendation from the manufacturer for individuals with kidney or liver disease.
