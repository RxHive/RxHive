# Ambroxol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination drug is typically used to relieve symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  The specific ingredients target different symptoms:

* **Ambroxol:**  A mucolytic, it thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** An antitussive, it suppresses cough.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant, it shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, it reduces runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or colds.
* **Menthol:** A topical analgesic and counterirritant that provides a cooling sensation and may help relieve mild throat irritation.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects may include:

* **Drowsiness:** Particularly with chlorpheniramine maleate.
* **Dry mouth:**  A common side effect of antihistamines.
* **Nausea:**  Possible with any of the ingredients.
* **Headache:** Relatively common.
* **Dizziness:** Can be associated with several components.
* **Insomnia:**  Especially if taken later in the day.

* **Increased heart rate:**  Possible with phenylephrine.
* **Irritability:** Particularly in children.
* **Allergic reactions:** While rare, allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling) are possible.


**How it Works:**

Each ingredient works through a different mechanism:

* **Ambroxol:** Increases the production of surfactant in the lungs, helping to thin mucus.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Phenylephrine:** Causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), reducing swelling in the nasal passages.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions and inflammation.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation through activation of cold-sensitive receptors on the skin and mucous membranes, potentially reducing the feeling of throat irritation.
