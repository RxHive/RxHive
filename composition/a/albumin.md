# Albumin
### Generic Name
Albumin (Human)

### Usage
Albumin is a protein naturally found in human blood.  Its primary medical use is to increase blood volume and maintain blood pressure in individuals who have experienced significant blood loss due to trauma, surgery, or burns.  This is because albumin helps to draw fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream, increasing blood volume and improving circulation.  It's also used to treat conditions characterized by low albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia), such as liver disease, kidney disease, and malnutrition.  Secondary uses may include treating shock, reducing edema (swelling), and providing nutritional support in specific situations.  However, these secondary applications are often less common and are usually carefully considered on a case-by-case basis by a medical professional.

### Dosage
Dosage of albumin is highly individualized and determined by a physician based on the patient's specific condition, blood volume status, and response to treatment. There isn't a standardized "one-size-fits-all" dosage.  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) and not orally, as it would be broken down in the digestive system.  The rate of administration is also carefully controlled to prevent complications.  Dosage is usually calculated based on the patient's weight and the severity of the condition. Pediatric dosage is determined by a pediatrician specializing in the patient's specific situation and calculated based on body weight and clinical picture.  Precise dosage instructions are always provided by the prescribing physician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of albumin administration, though relatively infrequent, include:

* Fever
* Chills
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Flushing
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis – a life-threatening reaction)

Less common but serious side effects can include fluid overload (leading to heart failure or pulmonary edema), clotting problems, and electrolyte imbalances.  Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Albumin is a colloid, meaning it's a large molecule that stays within the bloodstream. Its primary mechanism of action involves increasing oncotic pressure, the pressure exerted by proteins in the blood that draws fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream. This effect helps to expand blood volume, improve blood pressure, and reduce edema (swelling).  In essence, it acts as a volume expander and helps maintain the body's fluid balance.

### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with a history of allergic reactions to blood products should be carefully monitored. A test dose is often administered before a full dose to check for allergic reactions.
* **Fluid Overload:**  Patients with heart failure, kidney disease, or other conditions that impair fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Albumin administration can sometimes disrupt electrolyte balance.  Electrolyte levels should be monitored, especially in patients with pre-existing electrolyte imbalances.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe, the use of albumin during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Albumin itself doesn't typically interact with other medications but the underlying condition requiring albumin therapy might influence medication management.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take albumin orally?** A: No, albumin is administered intravenously (IV) because it's broken down in the digestive system if taken orally.
* **Q: How long does albumin stay in my system?** A: The half-life of albumin varies, but it's generally distributed throughout the body's fluids within a short time.
* **Q: Is albumin safe?** A: Albumin is generally considered safe when administered correctly by a healthcare professional under appropriate medical supervision,  however allergic reactions and fluid overload are potential risks.
* **Q: How is albumin stored?** A: Albumin should be stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically at a specific temperature to maintain its efficacy and safety.
* **Q: Can I buy albumin over the counter?** A: No, albumin is a prescription medication administered only by or under the direct supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.
