# Albumin

**Generic Name:** Albumin (Human)

**Usage:**

Albumin is used to treat various conditions involving low blood protein levels (hypoalbuminemia).  These conditions can stem from a variety of causes, including:

* **Hypovolemic shock:**  Severe blood loss resulting in decreased blood volume. Albumin expands blood volume, improving circulation.
* **Burns:** Severe burns cause fluid loss and protein leakage. Albumin helps restore fluid balance.
* **Nephrotic syndrome:** Kidney disease causing significant protein loss in urine. Albumin replenishes lost protein.
* **Liver disease:** Liver failure impairs albumin production, leading to low levels. Albumin supplementation helps maintain oncotic pressure.
* **Surgery:**  Albumin may be used to maintain blood volume during and after surgery.
* **Other conditions:**  Certain types of malnutrition and trauma may also warrant albumin administration.


**Side Effects:**

Albumin administration is generally considered safe, but potential side effects can occur, including:

* **Fluid overload:**  A common side effect, especially in patients with heart or kidney problems.  Symptoms can include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs and ankles, and increased blood pressure.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis can occur.  Monitor closely for symptoms like hives, itching, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* **Fever:**  A mild fever can sometimes develop.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Less common side effects.
* **Increased risk of infection:**  In some cases, albumin administration may increase the risk of infection.


**How it Works:**

Albumin is a major protein in human blood plasma.  Its primary function is maintaining oncotic pressure â€“ the pressure exerted by proteins in the blood that helps draw fluid back into the bloodstream from the surrounding tissues. When albumin levels are low, fluid leaks out of the blood vessels, leading to edema (swelling) and hypovolemia (low blood volume).  Administering albumin replenishes these levels, restoring oncotic pressure and helping to maintain blood volume and tissue fluid balance.


**FAQs:**

* **Is albumin derived from human blood?** Yes, albumin used medically is derived from human plasma donations and is rigorously screened and processed to ensure safety.
* **How is albumin administered?**  Albumin is typically administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.
* **Are there any contraindications?**  Albumin should not be given to individuals with severe heart failure, severe anemia, or certain types of allergic reactions to albumin.  Patients with kidney disease require careful monitoring.
* **Can I take albumin orally?** No, albumin must be given intravenously; it is digested if taken orally.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of albumin are usually seen relatively quickly after administration, but the duration of effect varies depending on the individual and the underlying condition.
* **What are the potential long-term effects?**  There are no significant known long-term side effects associated with albumin administration when used appropriately under medical supervision.
