# Aceclofenac + Misoprostol

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Misoprostol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that protects the stomach lining from the damaging effects of NSAIDs.  It's crucial to understand that this combination is prescribed specifically because of the gastroprotective effect of misoprostol mitigating the risk of stomach ulcers and other gastrointestinal complications associated with NSAID use.  It is NOT a substitute for taking aceclofenac alone.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual, but common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, heartburn, gas.  While misoprostol is added to protect the stomach, some gastrointestinal upset is still possible.
* **Central Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and high blood pressure (especially with long-term use).
* **Other:**  Skin rash, itching, allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious), fluid retention.  Rare but serious side effects may include liver damage, kidney problems, and blood disorders.

**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.
* **Misoprostol:**  Works by increasing the production of mucus and bicarbonate in the stomach lining, protecting it from the damage caused by aceclofenac.  It also reduces stomach acid secretion.  The combination effect provides pain relief with significantly reduced risk of gastrointestinal ulcers compared to aceclofenac alone.
