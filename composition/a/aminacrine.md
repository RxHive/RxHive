# Aminacrine
### Generic Name
Aminacrine

### Usage
Aminacrine, typically used as its hydrochloride salt (aminacrine hydrochloride), is primarily employed as a topical antiseptic for the treatment and prophylaxis (prevention) of superficial eye infections.  Its use is largely confined to ophthalmic applications. While it demonstrates some broader antimicrobial activity, its use outside of treating superficial eye infections is limited due to other more effective and safer alternatives.  Experimental research has also explored aminacrine's mutagenic properties, but this is not a therapeutic application.

### Dosage
Dosage for aminacrine hydrochloride eye drops varies depending on the specific formulation and the treating physician's instructions.  Generally, it involves instilling a few drops into the affected eye(s) at regular intervals, usually several times a day.  Precise instructions should always be obtained from a healthcare professional or by carefully reading the medication's label.  There is no standardized dosage for children as its use is mainly limited to adults.  Oral or injectable aminacrine is not a standard treatment approach.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Mild stinging or burning sensation upon application.
* Transient eye irritation.
* Allergic reactions (rare but possible).

Less common but potentially serious side effects are rare with topical application and would likely manifest as allergic reactions necessitating discontinuation of use.  Any unusual or persistent eye irritation or allergic reaction requires immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Aminacrine is an acridine dye that exerts its antimicrobial effect through several mechanisms. It binds to DNA, interfering with bacterial growth and replication. The exact mechanism varies depending on the target bacteria, but generally, its interaction with DNA leads to inhibition of essential bacterial processes, resulting in a bacteriostatic (growth-inhibiting) effect.  It is more effective against gram-positive bacteria.


### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with known allergies to aminacrine or related compounds should avoid using this medication.
* **Eye Injury:** Avoid using aminacrine if the eye is severely injured or damaged.
* **Contact Lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying aminacrine eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, you are using, as interactions are possible though not widely documented.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of aminacrine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult a doctor before use.
* **Children:**  The use of aminacrine in children hasn't been extensively studied; use should be guided by a healthcare professional.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store aminacrine eye drops?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take for aminacrine to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the infection's severity, but improvement should be noticeable within a few days of regular use.

* **Q: Can I use aminacrine for other infections besides eye infections?** A: No, aminacrine's primary and almost exclusive clinical use is for superficial eye infections.  Using it for other conditions is not recommended.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.
