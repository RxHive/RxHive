# Avatrombopag
### Generic Name
Avatrombopag

### Usage

Avatrombopag is a medication used to treat low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) in adults.  Its primary use is in two specific situations:

1. **Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) with Thrombocytopenia:** Avatrombopag is given to adults with CLD who are scheduled for a medical or surgical procedure.  Low platelet counts in these patients increase the risk of bleeding during and after the procedure. Avatrombopag helps raise platelet levels to a safer range before the procedure.

2. **Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) with Inadequate Response to Prior Treatment:**  This medication is used for adults with ITP who haven't responded adequately to other treatments. ITP is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, leading to low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. Avatrombopag helps to increase platelet production.  It's important to note that Avatrombopag is not typically used as a first-line treatment for ITP.


### Dosage

**Dosage instructions are complex and vary based on the condition and individual response.  The information below is a summary and should not replace guidance from a healthcare professional.**  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.

**Chronic Liver Disease (CLD)-Associated Thrombocytopenia:**

* Treatment begins 10-13 days before the scheduled procedure. The procedure is typically performed 5-8 days after the last dose.
* Platelet counts are assessed before starting treatment and on the day of the procedure.
* Oral administration:
    * Platelet count 40,000 to <50,000/mm³: 40 mg once daily (OD) for 5 consecutive days.
    * Platelet count <40,000/mm³: 60 mg OD for 5 consecutive days.


**Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP):**

* Oral administration: The initial dose is usually 20 mg OD.
* Dosage adjustments are made based on weekly platelet count monitoring until a stable platelet count of ≥50 x 10⁹/L is achieved. After that, monitoring becomes monthly.
* The goal is to achieve a platelet count of ≥50 x 10⁹/L, not to normalize platelet counts.
* The dose may be increased or decreased based on the patient's response.  Discontinuation is considered if there's no improvement after 4 weeks at the maximum dose of 40 mg OD or if the platelet count exceeds 400 x 10⁹/L after 2 weeks at 20 mg once weekly.
*  Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on whether the patient is taking medications that affect the metabolism of avatrombopag (CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of avatrombopag in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary in cases of hepatic or renal impairment, but specific guidelines often aren't provided in manufacturer's labeling due to limited clinical data showing the need for dose adjustments.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage based on your individual circumstances and test results.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** (Occurring in more than 10% of patients)

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Gingival hemorrhage (bleeding gums)
* Bruising (ecchymosis)
* Petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** (Occurring in 1-10% or less of patients)

* Arterial thromboembolism (blood clot in an artery)
* Venous thromboembolism (blood clot in a vein)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and pharynx)
* Portal vein thrombosis (blood clot in the portal vein)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood)
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including serious reactions like choking sensation, facial swelling, pharyngeal edema, and swollen tongue)


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Avatrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist.  Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce platelets. Avatrombopag works by mimicking the action of TPO, binding to and activating the TPO receptor on megakaryocytes (cells that develop into platelets). This activation leads to increased megakaryocyte production and maturation, ultimately resulting in a higher number of platelets in the bloodstream.  Importantly, it doesn't compete with natural TPO for receptor binding, offering an additive effect on platelet production.


### Precautions

* **Thromboembolic Risk:** Avatrombopag increases the risk of blood clots (thromboembolism).  Patients with risk factors for blood clots (e.g., factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, antithrombin deficiency, protein C or S deficiency) should be closely monitored.
* **Drug Interactions:** Avatrombopag's metabolism can be affected by other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Some notable interactions may occur with drugs like enzalutamide, mifepristone, fluconazole, and rifampin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Avatrombopag may harm a developing fetus. It is not typically recommended during pregnancy except in very serious situations, and other TPO receptor agonists are preferred if possible.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least two weeks after the last dose.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** While no dosage adjustments are explicitly recommended for hepatic or renal impairment based on available data, close monitoring is crucial.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Be aware of the possibility of allergic reactions, which can range from mild to severe. Stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms of an allergic reaction.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take avatrombopag with food?** A: Yes, it's recommended to take avatrombopag with food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the next scheduled dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How is avatrombopag stored?** A: Store avatrombopag according to the instructions provided on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see an increase in platelet counts varies depending on the condition and individual response. For CLD, the effect is generally seen before a scheduled procedure. For ITP, regular platelet monitoring is necessary to assess treatment effectiveness.
* **Q: Is avatrombopag safe for long-term use?** A: The long-term safety of avatrombopag is still under evaluation.  Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of long-term treatment with you.
* **Q: Can I stop taking avatrombopag suddenly?** A: It's not advisable to stop taking avatrombopag suddenly. Your doctor should supervise any dose reduction or discontinuation to minimize the risk of adverse effects.
