# Asfotase Alfa
### Generic Name
Asfotase Alfa

### Usage
Asfotase alfa is a medication used to treat hypophosphatasia (HPP), a rare genetic disorder affecting bone development.  It comes in two forms based on when the condition begins:  perinatal/infantile-onset HPP (appearing at birth or in infancy) and juvenile-onset HPP (appearing later in childhood).  In both forms, Asfotase alfa works by replacing a missing enzyme that's crucial for normal bone mineralization.  Without sufficient levels of this enzyme, bones become weak and prone to fractures. Asfotase alfa helps improve bone health and reduce the symptoms associated with the disease.

### Dosage

Asfotase alfa is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  Dosage varies based on the type of HPP and patient weight, and is always determined in consultation with a physician.

**Perinatal/Infantile-onset HPP:** The usual starting dose is 2 mg/kg three times per week (total 6 mg/kg weekly). Alternatively, a dose of 1 mg/kg six times per week (total 6 mg/kg weekly) may be used, but injection site reactions might be more frequent. The dose may be increased up to 9 mg/kg per week (3 mg/kg three times per week) if needed and determined by the physician based on lack of sufficient improvement in respiratory status, growth, or radiographic findings.  Dose increases are made at intervals of at least 4 weeks.

**Juvenile-onset HPP:** The usual dose is 2 mg/kg three times per week (total 6 mg/kg weekly), or 1 mg/kg six times per week (total 6 mg/kg weekly).

**Pediatric Patients (<40 kg):**  For pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg, it's recommended to avoid using the 80 mg/0.8 mL vial to ensure better systemic exposure.  Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate vial concentration for pediatric patients based on their weight.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Injection site reactions (erythema, pain, swelling, tenderness, itching, bruising, induration, atrophy, skin discoloration, hypertrophy)
* Nausea
* Vomiting

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Ectopic calcification (calcium deposits in abnormal locations, including eyes and kidneys)
* Lipodystrophy (abnormal fat distribution)
* Immunogenicity (the body's immune system reacting against the medication)
* Chronic active hepatitis
* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium)
* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)
* Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency
* Increased intracranial pressure leading to craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the skull bones).


**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Asfotase alfa is a recombinant form of the enzyme tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP).  In HPP, a deficiency in TNSALP leads to impaired mineralization of bones. Asfotase alfa replaces this missing enzyme. By restoring TNSALP activity, Asfotase alfa helps to improve bone mineralization, reduce bone fractures, and alleviate the symptoms of HPP.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:** Asfotase alfa should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients using Asfotase alfa have an increased risk of developing anti-drug antibodies, hypersensitivity reactions, lipodystrophy, ectopic calcifications (especially in the eyes and kidneys), and increased intracranial pressure possibly causing craniosynostosis.  Patients with a history of craniosynostosis should be treated with caution.
* **Caution in Pediatric Patients:**  Exercise caution in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg, as previously mentioned.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of asfotase alfa during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss any pregnancy or breastfeeding plans with your doctor.
* **Injection Site:** Injections should not be given in areas that are reddened, inflamed, or swollen. Injection sites should be rotated.

### FAQs

**Q: How is Asfotase Alfa stored?**

A: Asfotase Alfa should be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C). Administer the medication within 1 hour of removing it from refrigeration.

**Q: Can I take Asfotase Alfa with other medications?**

A: It is crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.  Some interactions might occur.

**Q: How long will I need to take Asfotase Alfa?**

A: Asfotase Alfa is typically a long-term treatment, and your doctor will determine the duration of therapy.

**Q: What if I miss a dose?**

A: Consult your doctor about the best course of action if you miss a dose.  Do not double the dose to compensate for a missed one.

**Q: Are there long-term effects associated with Asfotase Alfa use?**

A: Long-term studies are ongoing, but ongoing monitoring is important for detection and management of potential side effects, particularly related to ectopic calcification and lipodystrophy.
