# Abemaciclib
### Generic Name
Abemaciclib

### Usage
Abemaciclib is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of breast cancer.  Specifically, it's used for hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  Its applications include:

* **First-line treatment:**  In combination with an aromatase inhibitor, it's used as initial endocrine-based therapy for postmenopausal women and men with this type of breast cancer.
* **Treatment after progression on endocrine therapy:**  Combined with fulvestrant, it's used when the cancer has progressed despite previous hormone therapy. It can also be used as a single agent (monotherapy) after progression on endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy.
* **Adjuvant treatment:** In combination with endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor), it's used to reduce the risk of recurrence in high-risk patients with early-stage, node-positive HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, specifically those with a Ki-67 score â‰¥20%.  The Ki-67 score is a measure of how quickly the cancer cells are growing.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the treatment setting (first-line, post-progression, adjuvant) and whether it's used alone or in combination with other drugs.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**General Dosage Information (Adult):**

Abemaciclib is usually taken orally, twice daily (BID). The specific dose and duration depend on the individual patient's situation, including the type of cancer and past treatments.  Typical regimens include:

* **150 mg BID:** Often used in combination with other medications, such as an aromatase inhibitor (in first-line treatment) or fulvestrant (after progression on endocrine therapy).
* **200 mg BID:**  Sometimes used as a single agent after progression on prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dose might need to be adjusted based on factors like liver or kidney function, and the occurrence of side effects.  Your doctor will monitor your health closely and make any necessary adjustments.  Dosage reductions are common if side effects occur.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of abemaciclib haven't been established in children.


### Side Effects

Abemaciclib can cause several side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially more serious.  Common side effects often include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Decreased appetite
* Dizziness
* Vomiting
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Low blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)
* Liver enzyme elevation (increased ALT and AST)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)


Less common but serious side effects include:

* Severe diarrhea
* Severe low blood cell counts
* Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Severe liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Blood clots (venous thromboembolism)

**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.  CDK4 and CDK6 are enzymes involved in the cell cycle, specifically the growth and division of cancer cells. By blocking these enzymes, abemaciclib slows down or stops the growth of cancer cells, particularly those that are driven by estrogen.  It works best in combination with other treatments that target estrogen's effects on breast cancer cells.

### Precautions

* **Liver and kidney function:**  Abemaciclib's dosage might need to be adjusted for people with liver or kidney problems.
* **Drug interactions:**  Abemaciclib can interact with other medications, especially those metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4.  Inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Abemaciclib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose.
* **Other precautions:** Your doctor will discuss other specific precautions based on your individual health and medical history.
