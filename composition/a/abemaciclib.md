# Abemaciclib

**Generic Name:** Abemaciclib

**Usage:** Abemaciclib is used in the treatment of certain types of breast cancer. Specifically:

* **Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer:**  It's often used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (like letrozole or anastrozole)  for patients whose disease has progressed after hormone therapy.
* **HR+, HER2- early breast cancer:** It may be used in combination with endocrine therapy (hormone therapy) after surgery to help reduce the risk of the cancer returning.  The specific use here is dependent on individual patient factors and risk assessment.

**Side Effects:**  Abemaciclib, like many cancer treatments, can cause a range of side effects.  These can vary in severity from mild to severe and may include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Diarrhea (often severe), nausea, vomiting, fatigue, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), anemia (low red blood cell count), constipation, decreased appetite, headache, cough, shortness of breath.
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Severe diarrhea,  severe neutropenia (increasing risk of infection), severe infections, heart problems (including heart failure), liver problems, lung problems.  These require immediate medical attention.
* **Other Possible Side Effects:**  Hair thinning, rash, abdominal pain, muscle pain, back pain, dizziness.


**How it Works:** Abemaciclib is a type of targeted therapy called a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.  Cancer cells grow and divide rapidly.  CDK4 and 6 are proteins that are involved in regulating the cell cycle.  By inhibiting CDK4 and 6, abemaciclib slows down or stops the growth and spread of cancer cells, particularly those that are hormone receptor-positive.
