# Arteether

**Generic Name:** Artemether

**Usage:** Artemether is an antimalarial drug used to treat uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*.  It's often used in combination with other drugs, most commonly lumefantrine (CoartemÂ® is a common brand name example of this combination), to improve efficacy and reduce the risk of resistance.  It's typically prescribed for a short course of treatment.  The specific dosage and duration will be determined by a healthcare professional based on factors like the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  **It's crucial to only use artemether under the guidance of a doctor; self-medication is dangerous.**

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Weakness
* Loss of appetite
* Abdominal pain

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Changes in heart rhythm
* Seizures
* Severe liver damage
* Neurotoxicity (especially in high doses or in children)


**How it Works:** Artemether is a derivative of artemisinin, a natural compound extracted from the sweet wormwood plant (*Artemisia annua*). It works by interfering with the parasite's heme detoxification process.  Malaria parasites produce heme as a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion.  Artemether disrupts this process, leading to the accumulation of toxic heme and ultimately killing the parasite.
