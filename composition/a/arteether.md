# Arteether
### Generic Name
Arteether

### Usage
Arteether is a medication used primarily to treat severe malaria caused by the *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite, particularly strains resistant to chloroquine.  It's considered a second-line treatment for severe cases, including cerebral malaria (malaria affecting the brain).  Arteether is not typically used for uncomplicated malaria.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The standard adult dosage for malaria is 150 mg given intramuscularly (IM) once daily for three consecutive days.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of arteether in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these situations.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Cough
* Dizziness
* Body aches
* General weakness
* Vomiting
* Pain at the injection site
* Abdominal pain
* Leg pain
* Chills and rigors
* Diarrhea

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
Arteether is a derivative of artemisinin, a substance extracted from the *Artemisia annua* plant.  It works by targeting the *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite during its erythrocytic stage (the stage where the parasite infects red blood cells).  The precise mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to disrupt the parasite's lifecycle, ultimately leading to its death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Arteether is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to arteether or any of its components. It should also be avoided in patients concurrently using other medications that prolong the QT interval (a measure of the heart's electrical activity).
* **Warnings:** Arteether may increase the risk of QT interval prolongation.  It should be used with caution in patients with cardiac diseases.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of arteether during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Its use is generally not recommended in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  The benefits must be carefully weighed against potential risks.
