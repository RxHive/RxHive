# Ambroxol + Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Pseudoephedrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines the actions of three different drugs:

* **Ambroxol:**  A mucolytic agent, which means it helps to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.  This helps clear congestion in the airways.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that reduces the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps alleviate runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes associated with colds and allergies.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Dry mouth:**  This is a common side effect of antihistamines like chlorpheniramine.
* **Drowsiness:** Chlorpheniramine can cause drowsiness or sedation.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect of many medications.
* **Nausea:** Although less common, some individuals may experience nausea.
* **Insomnia:**  Pseudoephedrine can interfere with sleep in some people.
* **Increased heart rate:** Pseudoephedrine can stimulate the heart.
* **High blood pressure:**  This is a potential concern, especially for individuals with pre-existing hypertension.
* **Difficulty urinating:**  This is a less frequent side effect, but it can occur.
* **Nervousness or anxiety:** These are possible side effects, particularly from pseudoephedrine.


**How it Works:** As described above, the combination works by addressing different aspects of cold and allergy symptoms: Ambroxol thins mucus, pseudoephedrine reduces nasal congestion, and chlorpheniramine combats allergy-related symptoms.  They work synergistically to provide broader relief.
