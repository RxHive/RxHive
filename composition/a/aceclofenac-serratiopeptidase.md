**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

* **Serratiopeptidase:** This is a proteolytic enzyme derived from the bacteria *Serratia E15*.  It is believed to help reduce inflammation by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory process.  It may also help to reduce swelling and improve tissue repair. The exact mechanism of action in humans is still under investigation and not completely understood.
