# Arterolane
### Generic Name
Arterolane (in combination with Piperaquine Phosphate)

### Usage
Arterolane, a synthetic trioxolane antimalarial, is used in combination with piperaquine phosphate for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*.  It's a rapidly acting blood schizontocide, meaning it quickly kills the parasitic stage of malaria found in red blood cells.  **Importantly, Arterolane is not suitable for treating severe malaria.**

### Dosage

**Acute Uncomplicated Malaria ( *Plasmodium falciparum*):**

* **Adults (under 65 years):** One 150mg Arterolane / 750mg Piperaquine phosphate tablet once daily for three days.
* **Children (over 12 years):** One 150mg Arterolane / 750mg Piperaquine phosphate tablet once daily for three days.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, it notes that acute malaria often involves some degree of liver and/or kidney impairment, and the standard dose of Arterolane and piperaquine shows no significant adverse effects or loss of efficacy in these cases.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage in individuals with compromised liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not specified in provided data) may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Fever
* Cough
* Loss of appetite
* Weakness

While less common, serious side effects can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works

Arterolane, when combined with piperaquine, accumulates within the food vacuole of the malaria parasite.  It then generates reactive oxygen species, which disrupt heme detoxification within the parasite. This process ultimately leads to the parasite's death.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Arterolane is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Arterolane or any components of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and efficacy of Arterolane in pregnant and breastfeeding women have not been established.  Its excretion in breast milk is also unknown.  Consult a healthcare professional before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Vomiting:** If vomiting occurs within an hour of taking a dose, repeat the dose. If vomiting persists after a repeated dose, seek alternative antimalarial treatment.
* **Food:** Arterolane can be taken with or without food, but taking it with food may improve absorption.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Arterolane to treat all types of malaria?** A: No, Arterolane is only used for uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*.  It is not suitable for severe malaria or other types of malaria.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store Arterolane?** A: Store Arterolane as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?** A:  While specific drug interactions aren't listed in the provided data, it is crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking before starting Arterolane.
