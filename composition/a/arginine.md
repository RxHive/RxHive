# Arginine
### Generic Name
Arginine

### Usage
Arginine is primarily used as a diagnostic aid in assessing pituitary function, specifically to test the pituitary gland's capacity to release human growth hormone (hGH).  It's administered intravenously (IV) as a stimulant, and the resulting hGH levels in the blood are measured to determine if the pituitary gland is functioning normally.  Off-label, arginine is also used in the treatment of acute hyperammonemia, a condition characterized by dangerously high levels of ammonia in the blood, often associated with urea cycle disorders.  This off-label use is usually part of a broader treatment strategy involving other medications and potentially dialysis.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Pituitary Function Test (Diagnostic Aid):** 300 mL (30 g) of arginine hydrochloride infused intravenously over 30 minutes.

* **Hyperammonemia, Acute (Urea Cycle Disorders) (Off-label):** Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific urea cycle disorder and the patient's weight or body surface area (BSA).  It typically involves a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion.  Consult detailed prescribing information for precise dosage calculations in these situations.  Weight-based dosing or BSA-based dosing may be used.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Pituitary Function Test (Diagnostic Aid):** 0.5 g/kg of arginine hydrochloride administered intravenously over 30 minutes.  The maximum dose is 30 g.

* **Hyperammonemia, Acute (Urea Cycle Disorders) (Off-label):**  Dosage is highly individualized and dependent on the specific enzyme deficiency, weight, and clinical condition of the child. A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage, usually a combination of loading dose and continuous infusion.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Caution is warranted, especially in children, as arginine can potentially cause life-threatening hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Flushing (especially with rapid IV infusion)
* Venous irritation at the injection site
* Headache
* Numbness
* Nausea
* Vomiting


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, from post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Burning sensation of the skin (due to extravasation—leakage from the vein)
* Cerebral edema (brain swelling)
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Injection site reactions
* Lethargy
* Loss of consciousness
* Oral paresthesia (numbness or tingling in the mouth)
* Skin necrosis (tissue death) due to extravasation

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works

In the pituitary function test, arginine stimulates the release of human growth hormone (hGH) from the pituitary gland.  The amount of hGH released is an indicator of the gland's function.  In the treatment of hyperammonemia, arginine acts as a precursor in the urea cycle, assisting in the removal of ammonia from the blood.  The urea cycle is a series of biochemical reactions that convert toxic ammonia into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys.  By providing arginine, the body can more efficiently eliminate ammonia.

### Precautions

* **Contraindicated:**  Arginine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to arginine or any components of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients receiving arginine are at an increased risk for extravasation (leakage from the IV line) and hypersensitivity reactions.

* **Use with Caution:**  Arginine should be used cautiously in patients with electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium levels) and those with renal impairment.  Close monitoring is critical in these patients.


* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Arginine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. While amino acids are present in breast milk, the extent of excretion of arginine following administration is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is arginine stored?** A:  Storage conditions vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., powder vs. solution). Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions printed on the label.

* **Q: Can I take arginine with other medications?** A:  Consult with your doctor or pharmacist to assess potential interactions with other medications you are taking.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you are using arginine for chronic therapy, follow your doctor's instructions regarding missed doses.  For the diagnostic test, missed doses are not applicable.

* **Q: Is arginine safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term safety of arginine depends on the reason for use and individual patient factors. The benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated by a healthcare professional. Close monitoring is essential.

* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** A:  Signs of an allergic reaction can include rash, hives, itching, swelling (especially of the face, lips, or tongue), difficulty breathing, and dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms.
