# Arpiprazole
### Generic Name
Arpiprazole

### Usage
Arpiprazole is primarily used to treat schizophrenia, a chronic mental illness characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.  It's also effective in managing acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.  Additionally, it's used as an add-on treatment to antidepressants for major depressive disorder, and in some cases to treat irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents.  Arpiprazole may also be used off-label for other conditions, but this should always be in consultation with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.  

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia:**  Oral dosages typically start at 10-15 mg once daily, with a maximum dose of 30 mg daily. A long-acting injectable form is also available.
* **Bipolar I Disorder (acute manic or mixed episodes):** Initial oral doses range from 10-15 mg daily, possibly increasing to 30 mg daily, depending on the individual's response and whether it's used alone or with other mood stabilizers (like lithium or valproic acid).
* **Major Depressive Disorder:**  Usually used as an add-on medication to antidepressants, with initial doses as low as 2-5 mg daily, gradually increased under medical supervision.


**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children and adolescents varies greatly depending on the specific condition and the child's age and weight.  It is always initiated at a low dose and titrated upwards carefully under the close supervision of a physician.  Specific dosages for conditions like autism spectrum disorder, Tourette's syndrome, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are determined individually and are considerably lower than adult dosages.


**Administration:** Arpiprazole is available in oral tablet and oral solution forms, as well as a long-acting injectable form. Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions regarding administration.

If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your doctor or seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Arpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic. It works by affecting several neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine and serotonin. It acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.  This complex interaction helps to regulate the neurotransmitter imbalances believed to contribute to conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  By modulating dopamine and serotonin activity, it helps to reduce positive symptoms (like hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (like apathy and social withdrawal) in schizophrenia and manage mood swings in bipolar disorder.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Do not use arpiprazole if you are allergic to it or any of its components.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Arpiprazole is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug, meaning potential risks to a developing fetus cannot be ruled out.  It also passes into breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should discuss potential risks with their doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Arpiprazole can interact with various medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and alcohol, before starting arpiprazole.
* **Elderly Patients with Dementia:** Arpiprazole is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis; it may increase the risk of death in this population.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:**  Use caution in patients with a history of heart problems.
* **Suicidal Thoughts:** There is a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young adults (18-24 years of age). Close monitoring is advised.
