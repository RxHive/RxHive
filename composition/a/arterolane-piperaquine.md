# Arterolane + Piperaquine
### Generic Name
Arterolane + Piperaquine


### Usage

Arterolane and Piperaquine is a fixed-dose combination antimalarial medication used to treat uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax*.  Arterolane, an artemisinin derivative, acts quickly to reduce the parasite load, while piperaquine provides a longer-lasting suppressive effect. This combination is particularly effective in preventing recurrence of malaria after treatment. While primarily used for uncomplicated malaria, the specific suitability for individual cases always depends on local parasite resistance patterns and should be determined by a healthcare professional.  This combination is generally not recommended for treating severe malaria or malaria in pregnant women.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and will vary depending on factors such as age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  There isn't a standardized, universally accepted dosage guideline, as formulations and recommendations can differ based on regional variations and the specific product.  Always follow the instructions precisely as provided by your doctor or pharmacist. Generally,  the medication is given orally.  Intravenous administration is not typically used for this specific combination.  

**Always consult a healthcare provider for precise dosage instructions.**  Self-medication with antimalarials is dangerous and can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug resistance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Abdominal pain
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially serious side effects,  require immediate medical attention and include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Changes in heart rhythm
* Severe skin reactions
* Neuropsychiatric symptoms


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above,  immediately seek medical advice.


### How it Works

Arterolane, an artemisinin derivative, rapidly kills malaria parasites by interfering with their ability to reproduce. It achieves this primarily by producing free radicals that damage the parasite's DNA and other essential components. Piperaquine, on the other hand, has a longer half-life and works by inhibiting the parasite's growth and development, preventing the recurrence of the infection.  The combination of these two drugs ensures both a quick reduction in parasite numbers and sustained suppression to prevent relapse.


### Precautions

* **Allergic reactions:** Individuals with known hypersensitivity to artemisinin derivatives or piperaquine should avoid using this medication.
* **Drug interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated and only considered under strict medical supervision.  The risks and benefits need to be weighed.
* **Liver and kidney impairment:**  Patients with liver or kidney disease should use caution and may require dose adjustments.
* **G6PD deficiency:** Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are at increased risk of hemolytic anemia, so this combination should be used with extreme caution or avoided entirely.  A G6PD test may be necessary before commencing treatment.

Always inform your healthcare provider about any pre-existing medical conditions before starting this medication.
