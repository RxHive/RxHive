# Amifampridine
### Generic Name
Amifampridine

### Usage
Amifampridine is primarily used to treat Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in adults and children aged 6 to 17 years. LEMS is a rare neuromuscular disorder where the body's immune system attacks the communication between nerves and muscles, leading to muscle weakness.  Amifampridine improves muscle strength and function in patients with LEMS by impacting the release of neurotransmitters at the nerve-muscle junction.


### Dosage

**Adults (Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is typically 15-30 mg per day, divided into 3-4 doses.  The dose is carefully increased (by 5 mg every 3-4 days) based on the patient's response and tolerance. The maximum daily dose is 80 mg, with a maximum single dose of 20 mg.

**Children (Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, aged 6-17 years):**

Dosage depends on weight:

* **Weight < 45 kg:** The initial dose is 7.5-15 mg per day, divided into 2-3 doses. The dose can be increased in increments of 2.5-5 mg per day, up to a maximum single dose of 15 mg and a maximum daily dose of 50 mg.
* **Weight â‰¥ 45 kg:** The initial dose is 15-30 mg per day, divided into 2-3 doses. The dose can be increased by 5-10 mg per day, up to a maximum single dose of 30 mg and a maximum daily dose of 100 mg.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment, or those identified as N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) poor metabolizers.  These adjustments should be made under strict medical supervision. Specific instructions for these adjustments are provided separately and should be followed carefully.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Back pain
* Muscle spasms
* Upper respiratory tract infections

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**

* Dizziness
* Myasthenia (muscle weakness)
* Depression
* Insomnia
* Seizures
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Constipation
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Limb pain
* Bronchitis
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Influenza
* Viral infections
* Cataracts
* Falls

**Important:** Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Amifampridine is a potassium channel blocker.  While the exact mechanism in LEMS isn't fully understood, it's believed to increase the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for muscle contraction. By blocking potassium channels in nerve terminals, it enhances the amount of acetylcholine released, thereby improving neuromuscular transmission and reducing muscle weakness associated with LEMS.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amifampridine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to amifampridine phosphate, aminopyridines, or any component of the formulation; a history of seizures; or concurrent use of other forms of amifampridine or other aminopyridines.
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and seizures.  Use with caution in patients taking medications or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain antipsychotics), uncontrolled asthma, congenital QT syndromes, prolonged QT intervals, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, or who are NAT2 poor metabolizers.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with drugs that lower the seizure threshold increases the risk of seizures.  The combination with drugs having cholinergic effects may amplify cholinergic effects and increase adverse reactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Amifampridine's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Healthcare professionals should carefully weigh the risks and benefits before prescribing it to pregnant or breastfeeding women.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take amifampridine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  Some medications may increase the risk of side effects when taken with amifampridine.

* **Q: How should I store amifampridine?** A: Store amifampridine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.  If using an oral suspension, refrigerate and discard after 24 hours.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking amifampridine abruptly?** A:  No, you should not stop taking amifampridine without consulting your doctor.  Stopping suddenly may worsen your condition.  Your doctor will guide you on how to safely discontinue the medication.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects associated with amifampridine?** A: Long-term effects are not fully characterized, and regular monitoring is important. Discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider.
