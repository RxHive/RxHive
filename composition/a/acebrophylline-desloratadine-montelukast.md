# Acebrophylline + Desloratadine + Montelukast
### Generic Name
Acebrophylline + Desloratadine + Montelukast

**Note:**  A combination medication containing acebrophylline, desloratadine, and montelukast is not a standard, widely available formulation.  This information is provided based on the individual properties of each component drug and should not be interpreted as a prescription or endorsement of a specific, unapproved combination.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment.  The information below reflects the properties of each drug individually and should *not* be considered accurate for a hypothetical combined formulation.  Interactions and combined effects are unpredictable without specific clinical trials data for such a combination.


### Usage

This section describes the individual uses of each component. A combined formulation's use would depend on the specific manufacturer's recommendations (if available) and prescriber's judgment.

* **Acebrophylline:** A bronchodilator used primarily to relieve symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making breathing easier.

* **Desloratadine:** An antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives). It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.

* **Montelukast:** A leukotriene modifier used to prevent and treat asthma. Leukotrienes are substances in the body that cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, reducing inflammation and improving breathing.


### Dosage

Dosage for each component would vary greatly depending on factors such as age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  **There is no established safe and effective dosage for a combined formulation of these three drugs.**  A physician would prescribe the appropriate dose of each individual medication separately based on the patient's needs.  This information is not available for a non-existent combined drug.  Always refer to a medical professional for dosage instructions.


### Side Effects

This section lists potential side effects of each component individually.  The likelihood and severity of side effects in a hypothetical combined formulation are unpredictable.

**Acebrophylline:**

* Common: Headache, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, upset stomach.
* Less Common but Serious:  Fast or irregular heartbeat, seizures.

**Desloratadine:**

* Common: Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue.
* Less Common but Serious:  Allergic reactions (rare).

**Montelukast:**

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

This section explains how each drug works individually.  The combined action of these three drugs in an unapproved combination is undefined and not predictable.
