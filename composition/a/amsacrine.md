# Amsacrine
### Generic Name
Amsacrine

### Usage
Amsacrine is primarily used in adults for inducing remission in acute leukemia that hasn't responded to other treatments (refractory acute leukemia).  While its primary use is in this context, it's also sometimes used off-label in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often in combination with other chemotherapy agents.  It's important to note that the off-label uses are not as well-established as its use in refractory acute leukemia.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment decisions.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage of Amsacrine varies depending on the specific treatment protocol and the patient's condition.

* **Acute Leukemia (refractory):**  The typical induction dose is 75-125 mg/m²/day intravenously (IV) for five consecutive days, repeated every 3-4 weeks.  A higher dose (125 mg/m²/day) is generally preferred.  Two cycles may be necessary to achieve remission.  If the desired bone marrow suppression isn't achieved and there's no significant toxicity, the dose may be increased by 20% in subsequent cycles.  Once remission is achieved, a maintenance dose of roughly 50% of the induction dose is typically administered every 4-8 weeks, adjusted based on blood counts and marrow recovery.

* **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML - off-label):**  Off-label use often involves administering 120 mg/m² IV over 60 minutes on days 3, 5, and 7 of the second induction cycle, usually in combination with cytarabine. Alternatively, it might be given on days 4, 5, and 6, again in combination with cytarabine, with or without G-CSF.  Always follow the specific protocol outlined by the treating physician.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Amsacrine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on kidney and liver function:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** If bilirubin levels exceed 2 mg/dL, dose reduction is recommended.  A reduction of 30-40% for the initial dose is often suggested; subsequent doses may be increased carefully based on toxicity assessment. If bilirubin levels are significantly elevated (over 34 micromol/L or >2mg/dL), a dose reduction of at least 50% is necessary.

* **Renal Impairment:** If blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is >20 mg/dL and/or serum creatinine is >1.2 mg/dL, a dose reduction is typically recommended.  Specific adjustments are not explicitly detailed in the manufacturer's labeling but should be determined by the physician.  For creatinine levels between 1.2 and 1.8 mg/dL, no adjustment might be needed.  However, with creatinine levels above 2-3 mg/dL or in patients with oliguria (reduced urine production), an initial dose reduction of 30-40% is advised, with subsequent dose increases depending on toxicity monitoring.

* **Toxicity Management:** If life-threatening infection or hemorrhage occurs during a cycle, a 20% dose reduction in subsequent cycles should be considered.  Treatment cycles should be delayed until recovery from myelosuppression or resolution of leukemic infiltration is observed.


### Side Effects
Amsacrine can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity and frequency.  Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Hematologic: Bone marrow suppression (reduced blood cell production), and leukopenia (low white blood cell count).

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), heart failure, cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), and ECG changes.
* Nervous system: Confusion, dizziness, seizures, and neurological symptoms.
* Dermatological: Allergic reactions, rash, and hair loss.
* Hepatic: Liver damage (hepatotoxicity), jaundice.
* Renal: Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity).

This list is not exhaustive.  Other side effects are possible.  Any concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Amsacrine is an antineoplastic agent (anticancer drug) that works by interfering with the activity of topoisomerase II, an enzyme crucial for DNA replication and repair within cancer cells.  It also intercalates (inserts itself between) into DNA strands, causing double-strand breaks and ultimately inhibiting DNA synthesis. This leads to cell cycle arrest and cell death, primarily targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Amsacrine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Amsacrine, acridine derivatives, or any formulation component, and those with pre-existing bone marrow suppression caused by prior drug treatment or radiation therapy.

* **Interactions:**  Amsacrine can interact with various other drugs, potentially diminishing their effects or increasing the risk of side effects.  These interactions are complex and necessitate careful consideration by the prescribing physician.

* **Specific Populations:**  Amsacrine should be used with extreme caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women. It's not recommended during pregnancy because of potential harm to the fetus. Breastfeeding should be discontinued before Amsacrine treatment.  Due to the lack of established safety and efficacy data, it's not recommended for use in children.  Elderly individuals may require closer monitoring due to increased risk of side effects.

* **Other Precautions:**  Amsacrine should be administered intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes to minimize irritation.  Extravasation (leakage from the vein) should be avoided; immediate action is needed if it occurs.  Patients should be closely monitored for signs of bone marrow suppression, infection, bleeding, and other adverse effects.


### FAQs
* **Q: How is Amsacrine stored?**  A:  Specific storage instructions should be found on the product label, but generally, it should be stored at controlled room temperature, away from direct light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Never adjust the dosage of Amsacrine on your own. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately for guidance if you miss a dose.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while on Amsacrine?** A:  Alcohol can negatively interact with many medications, including chemotherapy drugs. Consult your healthcare provider for advice on alcohol consumption while on Amsacrine.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects are possible and can vary among individuals.  Regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider are crucial for monitoring and managing potential long-term effects.  

* **Q:  How long does it take to work?**  A:  The effects of Amsacrine, like other chemotherapy medications, are not immediate.  It works gradually over time, and response times vary greatly depending on the individual and the specific disease being treated.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed treatment plan and monitor your progress with your doctor.
