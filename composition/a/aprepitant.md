# Aprepitant
### Generic Name
Aprepitant

### Usage
Aprepitant is primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or CINV).  It's highly effective in preventing both the acute (occurring soon after chemotherapy) and delayed (occurring days after chemotherapy) nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cancer treatments that are particularly likely to cause vomiting).  It is also used to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery (postoperative nausea and vomiting or PONV).  In both cases, aprepitant is usually given in combination with other antiemetic medications for optimal effectiveness.


### Dosage

**Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV):**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the type and intensity of the chemotherapy regimen.  It's crucial to follow the precise instructions given by your oncologist or healthcare provider.  Aprepitant is available as capsules (125 mg and 165 mg) and an oral suspension (3 mg/kg), and intravenous (IV) injection (100mg & 130mg). The regimen typically involves a higher dose before the first chemotherapy treatment, followed by lower doses on subsequent days.  For example, a common regimen might include 125 mg orally one hour before the first chemotherapy treatment, followed by 80 mg daily for the next two days. IV regimens also exist and are usually administered closer to the time of the chemotherapy.

**Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV):**  For PONV prevention, a single 40 mg oral dose is typically administered within 3 hours before the start of anesthesia.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children depends on their weight and age.  Healthcare professionals will determine the appropriate dose of the oral suspension, usually 3mg/kg before chemotherapy on day 1, followed by 2mg/kg on days 2 and 3.  For children over 30kg or over 12 years old, adult dosages may be used, again under strict medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for individuals with severe liver impairment.  Renal impairment typically does not require dosage adjustments.  Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Fatigue

* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Diarrhea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)

If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Aprepitant works by blocking the activity of neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. These receptors are involved in the vomiting reflex triggered by chemotherapy drugs or surgical stimulation. By blocking these receptors, aprepitant prevents the signals that lead to nausea and vomiting.  It is most effective when combined with other antiemetic drugs, such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g., ondansetron) and corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone), which work through different mechanisms.  This combination approach targets multiple pathways in the vomiting reflex for optimal effectiveness.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Aprepitant is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to aprepitant or any of its components. It should not be used concurrently with certain medications, including pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, and cisapride, due to the risk of serious heart rhythm problems.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Aprepitant can interact with many other medications. It may affect how other drugs are processed in the body, and other drugs may affect how aprepitant works.  It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, herbal supplements, and over-the-counter drugs you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Aprepitant is a Category B drug during pregnancy, meaning that animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women. The use of aprepitant during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare professional. It might reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Caution is advised in individuals with severe liver disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take aprepitant with other medications?**  A:  It's crucial to tell your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as aprepitant can interact with many other drugs.

* **Q: How should I store aprepitant?** A: Store aprepitant as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, contact your healthcare provider immediately for guidance. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is aprepitant habit-forming?** A:  Aprepitant is not considered a habit-forming medication.

* **Q: Can I drive after taking aprepitant?** A: Because aprepitant can cause drowsiness and dizziness, avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.  Always follow your healthcare provider's advice.
