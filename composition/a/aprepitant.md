# Aprepitant

**Generic Name:** Aprepitant

**Usage:** Aprepitant is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (cancer treatment) that contains highly emetogenic (likely to cause vomiting) drugs.  It's also sometimes used to prevent nausea and vomiting after surgery.  It's typically part of a combination of antiemetic medications, not used alone.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects of aprepitant include:

* **Hiccups:** This is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Fatigue/tiredness:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Muscle pain:** Aches or pains in the muscles.
* **Rash:** Red, itchy skin.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:** This is usually monitored through blood tests and is generally asymptomatic.
* **Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema):** This is a rare but serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.


**How it Works:** Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of substance P, a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in triggering the vomiting reflex. By blocking these receptors, aprepitant prevents the signals that cause nausea and vomiting from reaching the brain's vomiting center.  It works primarily in the central nervous system.
