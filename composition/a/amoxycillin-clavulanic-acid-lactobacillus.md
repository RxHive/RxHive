# Amoxycillin + Clavulanic Acid + Lactobacillus

## Amoxycillin + Clavulanic Acid + Lactobacillus

**Generic Name:** Amoxicillin/Clavulanate Potassium + Lactobacillus (various strains possible, specific strain should be listed on product label)


**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat bacterial infections. Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that fights bacteria.  Clavulanic acid prevents the breakdown of amoxicillin by certain bacteria, allowing amoxicillin to be more effective. Lactobacillus is a probiotic, a beneficial bacteria added to help reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), a common side effect of amoxicillin.  This combination is often prescribed for infections of the ear, sinuses, respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. The specific infection treated will be determined by a doctor based on symptoms and test results.  **It is crucial to understand this combination is not a substitute for a doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan.**


**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Diarrhea (though lactobacillus aims to mitigate this), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion.
* **Less Common:**  Rash, itching, yeast infections (especially vaginal or oral thrush), headache, dizziness.
* **Serious (rare but require immediate medical attention):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis - difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat), seizures, colitis (severe inflammation of the colon), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).

This list is not exhaustive, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage.


**How it Works:**

* **Amoxicillin:**  It works by inhibiting the formation of the bacterial cell wall, ultimately leading to bacterial death.
* **Clavulanic Acid:** This acts as a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Some bacteria produce beta-lactamase enzymes that break down amoxicillin, rendering it ineffective. Clavulanic acid prevents this enzyme from breaking down amoxicillin, increasing its effectiveness against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
* **Lactobacillus:** Lactobacillus strains are added to help restore the balance of gut flora.  Antibiotics can disrupt this balance, leading to diarrhea.  Lactobacillus helps to repopulate the gut with beneficial bacteria, reducing the likelihood of AAD.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Some medications may interact negatively with this combination.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: How long should I take this medication?** A:  Complete the entire course of medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects may subside with continued use.  However, if you experience any serious side effects, especially allergic reactions, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.
* **Q: Is this medication safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A: Consult your doctor before taking this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking antibiotics, as it can worsen some side effects or interfere with the medication's efficacy.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.
