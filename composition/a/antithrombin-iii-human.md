# Antithrombin III Human
### Generic Name
Antithrombin III Human

### Usage

Antithrombin III (human) is a medication used for the prevention and treatment of blood clots in individuals with hereditary antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency.  Hereditary ATIII deficiency means the body doesn't produce enough of this naturally occurring protein, which helps prevent excessive clotting.  This deficiency increases the risk of serious blood clots (thrombotic and thromboembolic disorders) in veins and arteries.  The medication is primarily used in situations where a person has dangerously low levels of ATIII, putting them at significant risk of a serious clotting event.  It might also be used in situations like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition where abnormal blood clotting occurs throughout the body.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the severity of ATIII deficiency, the patient's weight, and their response to the medication.  ATIII activity levels must be monitored closely to guide dosing.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage based on these factors.

**Adults:** The dosage calculation is complex and depends on several factors including the patient's baseline ATIII activity, the desired target level (typically 80-120% of normal), and the patient's body weight.  It often involves a loading dose followed by maintenance doses administered intravenously (IV) at intervals of 4-6 hours or more, based on monitoring of ATIII levels.  Specific formulas are used to determine the dose in IU (International Units) per kilogram of body weight. These formulas should only be used by healthcare professionals experienced in managing ATIII deficiency.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Antithrombin III (human) in children have not been established.


**Administration:** Antithrombin III (human) is administered intravenously (IV) via injection or infusion.  The rate of infusion should not exceed 5 mL per minute.

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  The frequency of side effects isn't consistently defined in available information.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Anaphylactoid or anaphylactic reactions (ranging from mild reactions like fever and rash to severe reactions like difficulty breathing and shock) are possible. Tremor, hot flushes, and hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported.

**Important:** Any adverse reaction, no matter how mild, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Antithrombin III (human) works by supplementing the body's natural antithrombin III.  Antithrombin III is a protein that inhibits several clotting factors in the blood, thus preventing excessive clot formation.  By increasing the levels of ATIII in the blood, this medication helps restore the body's natural ability to regulate blood clotting, reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening thrombotic events.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Antithrombin III (human) is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the medication or any of its components, or a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), including anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction).  There is also a theoretical risk of transmitting infectious agents.
* **Drug Interactions:** The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced when used concurrently with Antithrombin III (human), increasing the risk of bleeding. Heparin dosage may need to be adjusted accordingly under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Antithrombin III (human) during pregnancy and lactation has not been established.  Use in these populations should only occur if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.
* **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of ATIII levels, and other coagulation tests as appropriate, is crucial during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Antithrombin III (human) stored?** A: Refer to the product-specific instructions for storage guidelines. It generally needs to be refrigerated.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effect is relatively rapid following IV administration, but the duration depends on the dose and individual patient factors.
* **Q: Can I take other medications with Antithrombin III (human)?** A:  It's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking to assess potential interactions.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects.
* **Q: Is Antithrombin III (human) a long-term treatment?** A: This depends entirely on the individual patient's condition and response to treatment.  The decision for long-term use is made by a healthcare professional.
