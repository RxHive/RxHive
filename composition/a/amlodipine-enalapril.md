# Amlodipine + Enalapril

**Generic Name:** Amlodipine/Enalapril

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, and enalapril is an ACE inhibitor.  By working together, they lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  This can reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney problems.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Amlodipine-related:** Headache, dizziness, flushing, swelling in ankles and feet (edema), fatigue, nausea.  Less common but more serious:  fast heartbeat, irregular heartbeat.
* **Enalapril-related:** Dry cough (a very common and sometimes bothersome side effect), dizziness, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, nausea, changes in taste. Less common but more serious:  angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat â€“ seek immediate medical attention if this occurs), low blood pressure, kidney problems.

It's crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list.  More serious side effects are possible, and individuals should consult their physician or pharmacist for a complete list and to report any unusual symptoms.

**How it Works:**

* **Amlodipine:** Relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow. This reduces the workload on the heart and lowers blood pressure.  It achieves this by blocking the entry of calcium ions into the cells of blood vessel walls.

* **Enalapril:** Blocks the action of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This enzyme helps produce a hormone called angiotensin II, which narrows blood vessels. By blocking ACE, enalapril reduces the amount of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and lower blood pressure.  It also reduces the workload on the heart.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a dangerous rebound effect, causing a sudden spike in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Moderation or avoidance is generally recommended while taking this medication. Discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Certain interactions can occur, so careful monitoring is important.

* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), chest pain, irregular heartbeat, or severe dizziness.
