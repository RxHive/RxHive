# Aclidinium + Formoterol
### Generic Name
Aclidinium + Formoterol

### Usage
Aclidinium + Formoterol is a combination inhaler used for the long-term maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* for relieving sudden shortness of breath (acute bronchospasm) or treating asthma.  It works by helping to keep the airways open, making breathing easier for individuals with COPD.  This combination therapy is intended for regular use to improve lung function and reduce symptoms, not for immediate relief of breathing difficulties.


### Dosage
**Adults (COPD):** The typical dose is one inhalation of Aclidinium 400 mcg/Formoterol 12 mcg twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening).  The maximum daily dose is two inhalations (Aclidinium 800 mcg/Formoterol 24 mcg).  The medication is administered via a breath-actuated dry powder inhaler.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Aclidinium + Formoterol in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with liver or kidney impairment, but caution is advised in cases of severe liver impairment, as Formoterol exposure may increase.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Urinary tract infection
* Influenza
* Back pain
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Muscle pain
* Cough
* Sore throat (oropharyngeal pain)
* Sinusitis
* Upper respiratory tract infection


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing difficulties)
* Allergic skin reactions (rash, itching, hives)


If you experience any concerning side effects, stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Aclidinium + Formoterol combines two different mechanisms to improve breathing in COPD patients:

* **Aclidinium:** This is an anticholinergic medication.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a chemical that causes the airways to constrict. By blocking this action, Aclidinium helps relax the muscles surrounding the airways, making it easier to breathe.

* **Formoterol:** This is a long-acting beta-2 agonist bronchodilator. It works by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the lungs, causing the muscles around the airways to relax and widening the airways, improving airflow.

The combination of these two medications provides a broader and more effective approach to managing COPD symptoms compared to using either drug alone.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Aclidinium + Formoterol is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to aclidinium, formoterol, or any component of the formulation. It's also contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins and should not be used in patients with asthma without a concomitant inhaled corticosteroid.

* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of asthma-related deaths, paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiovascular effects, hypokalemia (low potassium levels), and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in certain patients.  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypokalemia, cataracts or glaucoma, seizure disorders, and urinary retention.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety and efficacy of Aclidinium + Formoterol during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been established.  Consult a healthcare professional before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Specific Populations:** Older adults and patients with certain pre-existing conditions may require closer monitoring while using this medication.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use Aclidinium + Formoterol for sudden shortness of breath?**
   * **A:** No, this medication is for long-term maintenance and is not a rescue inhaler for acute bronchospasm.  Use a short-acting bronchodilator for immediate relief as directed by your physician.

* **Q: How should I store Aclidinium + Formoterol?**
   * **A:** Store the inhaler as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
   * **A:** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take to see the effects?**
   * **A:**  The effects may vary, but many individuals notice an improvement in their breathing within a few days of starting treatment. However, the full benefit is usually observed after several weeks of regular use.

* **Q: When should I consult a doctor?**
   * **A:** Consult your healthcare provider if you experience any adverse effects, if your symptoms worsen, or if you have any questions or concerns about using this medication.  Regular monitoring of your lung function is important.
