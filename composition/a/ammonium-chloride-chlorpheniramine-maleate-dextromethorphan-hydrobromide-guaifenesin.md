# Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold or flu.  The specific ingredients target different symptoms:

* **Ammonium Chloride:** Acts as an expectorant, helping to loosen and thin mucus in the lungs and airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps to dry up runny nose and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.
* **Guaifenesin:** Another expectorant that helps thin and loosen mucus.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a very common side effect, especially with the antihistamine (chlorpheniramine).
* **Dry mouth:** Also common due to the antihistamine.
* **Dizziness:** Can occur with both the antihistamine and cough suppressant.
* **Nausea:** Less common, but possible.
* **Constipation:**  A possible side effect.
* **Headache:** Can occur.
* **Irritability/Restlessness (paradoxical effects):** More likely in children. This is the opposite of the expected effect of the medication (drowsiness).
* **Allergic reactions:** While rare, allergic reactions such as rash, hives, itching, or difficulty breathing can occur.


**How it Works:**  As detailed above, each ingredient works differently to address specific cold/flu symptoms:

* **Ammonium Chloride & Guaifenesin:** These expectorants increase the fluid content of respiratory tract mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This antihistamine blocks the action of histamine, a substance released during an allergic reaction, thereby reducing runny nose, sneezing and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This cough suppressant acts on the cough center in the brain to reduce the urge to cough.
