# Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin
### Generic Name
Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Guaifenesin


### Usage

This combination medication is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold or the flu.  It's a multi-ingredient formulation designed to address several symptoms simultaneously.  Let's break down each component's role:

* **Ammonium Chloride:** Acts as an expectorant, helping to thin and loosen mucus in the respiratory tract, making it easier to cough up.  This is particularly helpful in relieving congestion associated with coughs and colds.

* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** This is an antihistamine that helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes, common allergy and cold symptoms.

* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps reduce the urge to cough. It's particularly effective for dry, non-productive coughs.

* **Guaifenesin:** Another expectorant, similar to ammonium chloride, it thins mucus and facilitates its removal from the airways.


The combined action of these ingredients aims to provide relief from a range of cold and flu symptoms, including cough, congestion, runny nose, and sneezing.  It's crucial to remember this medication treats *symptoms* and not the underlying viral infection itself.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific brand and formulation of the medication.  **Always follow the instructions printed on the product label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There is no universally applicable dosage as different brands will contain different strengths of each ingredient.  Self-medicating, especially in children, requires careful attention to age-appropriate formulations and dosages.  

**Never exceed the recommended dosage.**  Oral formulations are typically tablets, capsules, or liquids (syrups).  Intravenous (IV) administration is not applicable for this particular combination of drugs.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Constipation
* Headache


Less common but potentially serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast heartbeat
* Irregular heartbeat
* Confusion
* Seizures


If you experience any serious or unusual side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

As detailed in the "Usage" section, each component works independently to target specific cold and flu symptoms. The combined effect offers broader symptomatic relief.  Ammonium chloride and guaifenesin work as expectorants by reducing the viscosity (thickness) of mucus, enabling its easier expulsion.  Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks the action of histamine, a chemical responsible for allergy and cold symptoms.  Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the brain's cough center.
