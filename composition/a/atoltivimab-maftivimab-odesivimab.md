# Atoltivimab + Maftivimab + Odesivimab
### Generic Name
Atoltivimab + Maftivimab + Odesivimab

### Usage
Atoltivimab, Maftivimab, and Odesivimab is a combination of three monoclonal antibodies used to treat infections caused by *Zaire ebolavirus* in adults and children, including newborns whose mothers tested positive for the virus via RT-PCR.  It's crucial to understand that this combination's effectiveness hasn't been proven against other Ebolavirus or Marburgvirus species.  The primary use is in combating Ebola virus disease caused by *Zaire ebolavirus*.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage for both adults and children (including neonates) is a single intravenous (IV) dose of 50 mg/kg of each antibody (Atoltivimab, Maftivimab, and Odesivimab).  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended based on hepatic or renal impairment, according to the manufacturer's labeling.  The medication requires dilution before administration and should be given through an IV line with a 0.2-micron filter.  The infusion rate depends on the patient's weight and should be slowed or stopped if adverse reactions occur.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Chills
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
*   Increased serum potassium levels
*   Diarrhea
*   Vomiting
*   Increased serum AST levels (liver enzyme)
*   Increased serum creatinine levels (kidney function indicator)
*   Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
*   Fever

Less common side effects (1-10% of patients) include:

*   Decreased or increased serum potassium or sodium levels
*   Increased serum ALT levels (liver enzyme)
*   Hypoxia (low blood oxygen)

Serious but less frequent side effects include hypersensitivity reactions (including life-threatening infusion reactions) and infusion-related reactions.  Any adverse effect should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Atoltivimab, Maftivimab, and Odesivimab work by targeting the *Zaire ebolavirus* glycoprotein. This glycoprotein is essential for the virus to attach to and enter human cells.  Each antibody in the combination has a slightly different mechanism: Maftivimab neutralizes the virus by blocking its entry, while Odesivimab enhances the immune response. Atoltivimab combines both neutralization and immune response enhancement properties. By binding to the glycoprotein simultaneously, the three antibodies effectively prevent the virus from infecting cells and help the body clear the infection.


### Precautions
While no specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer, there is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially life-threatening infusion reactions.  Close monitoring during and after infusion is crucial.  Avoid concurrent use of live vaccines; a significant time interval (3-6 months, and possibly up to 11 months) may be necessary between antibody therapy and vaccination.  The use of Atoltivimab, Maftivimab, and Odesivimab during pregnancy should not be withheld due to the high mortality risk of Ebola virus infection to both mother and fetus, however  breastfeeding should be avoided to minimize transmission to the infant per CDC and WHO recommendations.  The evolving nature of the *Zaire ebolavirus* and potential development of resistance should be considered when using this treatment.
