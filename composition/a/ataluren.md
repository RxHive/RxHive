# Ataluren
### Generic Name
Ataluren

### Usage
Ataluren is primarily used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in ambulatory patients aged 2 years and older.  It's specifically indicated for those with a confirmed nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. This mutation leads to a prematurely stopped protein production, and Ataluren works to help overcome this, allowing for the creation of a more complete dystrophin protein.  Currently, it is not approved for other conditions.

### Dosage

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):**

* **Oral:** The recommended dose is 40 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses: 10 mg/kg in the morning, 10 mg/kg midday, and 20 mg/kg in the evening.  Maintain a 6-hour interval between the morning and midday doses, and between the midday and evening doses.  A 12-hour interval should be maintained between the evening dose and the next morning's dose.

* **Missed Doses:** If a dose is missed by less than 3 hours after the morning or midday dose, or less than 6 hours after the evening dose, take it as soon as possible and continue with the usual schedule.  However, if the delay is longer, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time.  Never double a dose.


* **Adults and Children (≥2 years, ≥12 kg):** The dosage is the same for both adults and children meeting the weight and age criteria.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
* **Renal Impairment:** No adjustment is needed for mild to moderate impairment.  However, Ataluren is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides)
* Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol)
* Vomiting

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal distress
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Flatulence
* Nausea
* Upper abdominal pain
* Erythematous rash (red rash)
* Weight loss
* Hematuria (blood in urine)
* Urinary incontinence
* Limb pain
* Musculoskeletal chest pain
* Cough
* Epistaxis (nosebleed)
* Fever


**Less Frequent Side Effects (frequency not defined):**

* Renal function test abnormalities (increased creatinine, BUN, and cystatin C levels)


**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ataluren works by enabling the ribosome (the protein-making machinery in cells) to read through a premature stop codon in the messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes for dystrophin. A nonsense mutation creates this premature stop codon, resulting in a shortened, non-functional dystrophin protein.  Ataluren allows the ribosome to ignore the stop codon, resulting in the production of a more complete, though potentially not fully functional, dystrophin protein. This can lead to improved muscle function in some patients.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ataluren is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Ataluren or any of its components, and in those concurrently using intravenous aminoglycosides.

* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of hypertension, abnormal lipid levels (high cholesterol and triglycerides), and renal effects (small increases in creatinine, BUN, and cystatin C) have been observed.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ataluren should be avoided during pregnancy.  It is unknown whether Ataluren is excreted in breast milk, therefore breastfeeding should be discontinued if using this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:** Ataluren may interact with other medications, such as adefovir, aminoglycosides, and ciprofloxacin, potentially increasing their serum concentrations.  Rifampin may decrease Ataluren's serum concentration.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting Ataluren.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Refer to the dosage adjustment section for specific considerations.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Ataluren?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. This generally involves storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take Ataluren with food?** A: Yes, Ataluren granules should be mixed with at least 30 mL of liquid (water, milk, or juice) or at least 45 mL of semisolid food (yogurt or applesauce) and administered immediately.

* **Q: Is Ataluren suitable for everyone with DMD?** A: No, Ataluren is only indicated for ambulatory patients with a confirmed nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene.

* **Q: What should I do if I suspect an allergic reaction?** A: Stop taking Ataluren immediately and seek medical attention.

* **Q: How often will I need blood tests?** A: Your doctor will determine the frequency of blood tests based on your individual needs, but it may include monitoring kidney function and lipid levels.  Regular monitoring is crucial.
