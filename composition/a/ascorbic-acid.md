# Ascorbic Acid
### Generic Name
Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)

### Usage
Ascorbic acid, commonly known as vitamin C, is a water-soluble vitamin and a powerful antioxidant. Its primary use is to prevent and treat vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), a condition characterized by weakness, fatigue, bleeding gums, and impaired wound healing.  While not a primary indication,  ascorbic acid is also used in higher doses for various other conditions, often off-label. These include supporting wound healing,  reducing the duration and severity of common colds (although the evidence for this is debated), and potentially assisting in the management of certain infections and inflammatory conditions.  Research is ongoing to explore its role in several other health areas.  It's crucial to understand that using ascorbic acid for conditions other than scurvy should be guided by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the purpose of administration and the individual's health status.  The following information is for guidance only and should not replace a doctor's advice:

**Adults:**

* **Dietary Recommendation (RDA):**  The recommended daily allowance varies by age, sex, and pregnancy/lactation status (see details below).  The upper limit of intake is generally set at 2000mg/day to avoid potential adverse effects.
* **Ascorbic acid deficiency:**  Treatment doses are considerably higher than the RDA, often ranging from 100mg to several grams daily, depending on the severity of the deficiency. This is usually adjusted according to individual response and lab results.
* **Other uses (off-label):** Dosage for conditions such as severe burns or sepsis is determined individually by the physician and may reach many grams per day.

**Children:**

Dosage in children depends on age and weight. Pediatric RDA is lower than adults, and exceeding the recommended daily amount should be avoided.  A doctor should always determine the correct dose for children, especially for uses beyond supplementing dietary intake.  Again, parenteral administration for children is generally via intramuscular injection to avoid adverse effects.

**Forms:** Ascorbic acid is available in various forms including tablets, capsules, powders, syrups, and injectable solutions (IV, IM, or subcutaneous).  Always follow the prescribed administration route and dosage instructions.


**Dietary Reference Intake (IOM 2000):**

* **Males (≥19 years):** 90 mg/day; maximum 2000 mg/day
* **Females (≥19 years):** 75 mg/day; maximum 2000 mg/day
* **Pregnant females (19-50 years):** 85 mg/day; maximum 2000 mg/day
* **Lactating females (19-50 years):** 120 mg/day; maximum 2000 mg/day
* **Smokers (adults):** Add 35 mg/day to the RDA; maximum 2000 mg/day
* **Children:** RDA varies significantly by age group. Refer to your child's pediatrician for specific recommendations.  Maximum daily intake also varies with age, from 400mg to 1800mg depending on the age.

**Note:**  Individuals with hemochromatosis, G6PD deficiency, or renal impairment require careful monitoring and potentially adjusted dosages to minimize the risk of adverse effects.  Always consult with your doctor or pharmacist before starting or changing your dosage of ascorbic acid.


### Side Effects

**Common (≥1%):**  Generally, at recommended dosages, ascorbic acid is well-tolerated. However, high doses may cause digestive upset including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and heartburn.  Other less common effects may include headache, fatigue, and dizziness.

**Less Common but Serious:**  Very high doses can lead to kidney stones (due to increased oxalate excretion), hyperoxaluria, and in rare cases, interactions with other medications.


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are persistent or severe, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Ascorbic acid is a crucial cofactor for several essential enzymes involved in various metabolic processes.  Its antioxidant properties help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.  Furthermore, it is vital for collagen synthesis (important for skin, bone, and connective tissue), iron absorption, and the immune system function.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** There are generally no absolute contraindications for ascorbic acid at appropriate dosages.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ascorbic acid can interact with certain medications, potentially altering their effectiveness. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications, especially amphetamines, bortezomib, cyclosporine, aluminum hydroxide, deferoxamine, or estrogen derivatives.
* **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and older adults should use ascorbic acid only under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Individuals with kidney stones, hemochromatosis, or G6PD deficiency should be particularly cautious.
* **High Doses:**  Avoid very high doses of ascorbic acid unless specifically recommended by a healthcare professional to avoid potential adverse effects.

### FAQs

* **Can I take ascorbic acid with other supplements?**  It's advisable to discuss potential interactions with your doctor or pharmacist before combining ascorbic acid with other supplements or medications.
* **How should I store ascorbic acid?**  Store ascorbic acid in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, to maintain its potency.
* **Is it safe to take ascorbic acid long-term?**  Long-term use of ascorbic acid at recommended doses is generally safe. However, high doses over extended periods can increase the risk of side effects. Consult with your doctor about long-term use.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's close to the time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **What are the signs of vitamin C deficiency?**  Signs include fatigue, weakness, bleeding gums, easy bruising, and impaired wound healing. If you suspect a vitamin C deficiency, consult your doctor for diagnosis and treatment.
