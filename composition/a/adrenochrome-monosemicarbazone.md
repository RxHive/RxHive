# Adrenochrome Monosemicarbazone
### Generic Name
Adrenochrome Monosemicarbazone

### Usage
Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone is primarily used to prevent and treat various types of capillary bleeding.  This includes bleeding from the kidneys (hematuria), the eyes (retinal hemorrhage), the nose (epistaxis), the uterus (uterine bleeding), wounds, and other sources of minor bleeding. It's particularly helpful in situations where small blood vessels are prone to leakage.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Oral:**  1-2 tablets three times daily (TID), ideally taken one hour before meals.
* **Intramuscular (IM):**
    * **Preoperative:** 2-6 mL the evening before surgery, followed by another injection about half an hour before the procedure. Oral or subcutaneous (SubQ) administration may also be used pre-operatively.
    * **Postoperative:** 1-2 mL every two hours.
    * **Non-surgical conditions:** 2-4 mL three times daily.

**Children:**  Generally, children receive half the adult dose.  However, for the 5 mg/mL injection containing diprophylline (90 mg/mL), the dose should not exceed 0.3 mL for premature babies, infants, and young children.  Always consult a pediatrician for precise pediatric dosing.


### Side Effects

* Nausea
* Rash
* Stomach upset
* Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)
* Acute toxicity (rare but serious)

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone is a hemostatic agent, meaning it helps stop bleeding.  It works by reducing capillary permeability (the leakiness of tiny blood vessels). This reduces bleeding time without affecting the cardiovascular system or respiration, unlike some other drugs with similar effects.  It's a water-soluble derivative of adrenochrome, an oxidation product of adrenaline (epinephrine), but it lacks the systemic effects associated with adrenaline.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of acute toxicity and gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea).
* **Use with Caution:** This medication should be used cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women, elderly patients, children, and patients with liver disease.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Antihistamines may reduce the effectiveness of adrenochrome monosemicarbazone.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Q: Can I take adrenochrome monosemicarbazone with other medications?** A: Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions may occur, potentially altering the effectiveness or safety of adrenochrome monosemicarbazone.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.
