# Antithrombin Recombinant
### Generic Name
Antithrombin Recombinant

### Usage
Antithrombin recombinant is a medication used to prevent blood clots (thromboembolic events) in people with hereditary antithrombin deficiency.  This deficiency means the body doesn't produce enough antithrombin, a natural protein that helps prevent excessive clotting.  The medication is specifically used in the perioperative period (around the time of surgery) and the peripartum period (around childbirth) to reduce the risk of dangerous blood clots forming in these high-risk times.  It's crucial to understand that this medication *prevents* clots, not *treats* existing ones.  If a blood clot develops, different treatment will be necessary.

### Dosage
Dosage of antithrombin recombinant is highly individualized and depends on several factors: the patient's pre-treatment antithrombin activity level (measured as a percentage of normal), their weight in kilograms, and whether they are undergoing surgery or are pregnant.  Treatment aims to maintain antithrombin activity levels between 80-120% of normal (0.8-1.2 IU/mL).  The medication is given intravenously (IV).

**Perioperative (around surgery) and Peripartum (around childbirth):**

Dosage calculations involve complex formulas considering baseline antithrombin activity and body weight.  A loading dose is administered as a 15-minute IV infusion followed by a continuous maintenance infusion. The specific formulas are best determined and monitored by a healthcare professional experienced in managing antithrombin deficiency.  The treatment continues until adequate anticoagulation (blood thinning) from other methods is established.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of antithrombin recombinant in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dosage is frequently adjusted based on regular monitoring of antithrombin activity levels.  If levels are below 80%, the dose is increased. If levels exceed 120%, the dose is decreased.  The specific adjustment percentages and monitoring frequency are guided by a healthcare provider.  Currently, there are no specific dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturerâ€™s labeling for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Dizziness
* Chest pain
* Abnormalities in liver enzyme levels
* Hematuria (blood in urine)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Hematoma (bruise)
* Hemarthrosis (bleeding into a joint)
* Infusion-site reaction

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects (less than 1%, from post-marketing surveillance and case reports) include:

* Blurred vision
* Chest tightness
* Chills
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Fever
* Gastrointestinal fullness
* Muscle cramps
* Nausea
* Unpleasant taste
* Urticaria (hives)

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.


### How it Works
Antithrombin is a naturally occurring protein that plays a critical role in preventing blood clots. It works by inhibiting two key enzymes involved in blood clotting: thrombin and factor Xa.  By binding to these enzymes, antithrombin prevents them from forming clots.  The recombinant form of antithrombin provides this crucial protein to individuals who lack sufficient amounts naturally.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Antithrombin recombinant is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to goat or goat milk proteins (since it is produced using goat cells).
* **Allergic Reactions:** There's an increased risk of allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild (hives) to severe (anaphylaxis).  Close monitoring for such reactions is crucial.
* **Interactions:** The anticoagulant effects of heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are enhanced by antithrombin recombinant.  Concurrent use necessitates careful monitoring of coagulation tests and dosage adjustments to avoid excessive bleeding.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Antithrombin recombinant is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are unknown. It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is warranted during breastfeeding. Use only when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is antithrombin recombinant administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV) as a loading dose followed by a continuous infusion.

* **Q: How long does treatment typically last?** A: Treatment duration varies depending on the situation (surgery or childbirth) and is determined by the healthcare provider based on regular monitoring of antithrombin levels and overall clinical status.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any new or worsening symptoms immediately to your doctor or healthcare provider.

* **Q: How is antithrombin recombinant stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product packaging. Generally, it needs to be refrigerated.

* **Q: Can I take other medications with antithrombin recombinant?** A: It's essential to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, to identify potential drug interactions.
