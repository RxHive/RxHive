# Amoxapine
### Generic Name
Amoxapine

### Usage
Amoxapine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily used to treat depressive symptoms in various conditions.  This includes neurotic or reactive depressive disorders, as well as endogenous and psychotic depressions. It's particularly useful for depression accompanied by anxiety or agitation.  While not its primary indication, amoxapine's dopamine receptor-blocking properties can also provide some benefit in managing certain psychotic symptoms in individuals already diagnosed with depression.


### Dosage

**Adults:** Amoxapine is administered orally.  The starting dose is typically 50 mg twice or three times daily. This may be increased gradually, often reaching a maintenance dose of 200-300 mg/day within a week.  However, significant sedation can occur initially.  In some cases, higher doses (up to 400 mg daily for outpatients, or 600 mg for hospitalized patients who haven't responded to other treatments) may be used under strict medical supervision.  Once an effective dose is found, the total daily dose of 300mg or less can be taken once daily at bedtime. Doses exceeding 300mg/day should be divided.

**Elderly Adults:**  The initial dose is lower, typically 25 mg twice or three times daily, with careful titration up to a maximum of 300 mg daily, usually in divided doses. The usual effective dose is 100-150 mg/day.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of amoxapine in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dose adjustments are outlined in the prescribing information for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is strongly advised due to amoxapine's metabolism in the liver and excretion via the kidneys.  Close monitoring is crucial in these populations.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Constipation

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Anxiety
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)

* Insomnia
* Restlessness
* Palpitations
* Skin rash
* Increased prolactin levels (can lead to menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea [breast milk production])
* Tremor
* Blurred vision
* Increased sweating (Diaphoresis)
* Agranulocytosis (severe drop in white blood cells)
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS - a rare but life-threatening condition)
* Seizures
* Suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially important to monitor in younger adults)

If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Amoxapine works by affecting the levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Primarily, it inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their availability in the synapses (connections between nerve cells). This helps improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression.  A significant metabolite of amoxapine, 7-OH-amoxapine, also blocks dopamine receptors, contributing to its potential effectiveness in managing some psychotic symptoms related to depression.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amoxapine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to amoxapine or dibenzoxazepine, those taking or having recently taken MAO inhibitors (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), patients in the acute recovery phase following a myocardial infarction (heart attack), and those with uncorrected narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with barbiturates, antiparkinsonian agents, antipsychotics, antihypertensives, and sympathomimetics requires caution due to potential interactions and adverse effects.  Avoid use with MAOIs.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amoxapine is a Category C medication during pregnancy, meaning its safety has not been definitively established. It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should exercise caution.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  There's an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in young adults. Close monitoring is crucial, particularly in vulnerable individuals.
* **Other Precautions:**  Exercise caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, seizure disorders, or those at risk for increased intraocular pressure.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take before I see improvement?** A:  Significant improvement may not be seen for several weeks.  Consistency in taking the medication as prescribed is vital.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Amoxapine suddenly?** A: No.  Abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a bedtime dose, do not take it in the morning.  Do not double the next dose. Consult your doctor if you frequently miss doses.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Amoxapine?** A:  Alcohol can exacerbate the sedative effects of amoxapine. It's best to avoid alcohol while on this medication.
* **Q: How should I store Amoxapine?** A: Store Amoxapine as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.  Keep it out of the reach of children.
