# Azficel-T
### Generic Name
Azficel-T

### Usage
Azficel-T is a prescription medicine used to improve the appearance of moderate-to-severe nasolabial fold wrinkles (the lines that run from the sides of the nose to the corners of the mouth) in adults.  It's an autologous cell therapy, meaning the cells used are derived from the patient's own skin.  This is its primary and currently only approved use.

### Dosage
Azficel-T is administered via intradermal injection (into the skin). The recommended treatment involves a series of three sessions, spaced 3 to 6 weeks apart.  During each session, up to 2 mL of Azficel-T is injected, with 0.1 mL administered per linear centimeter of nasolabial fold wrinkle.  

Azficel-T is not approved for use in children; its safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.  No dosage adjustments are specified for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Injection-site redness
* Bruising
* Swelling
* Pain
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Edema (fluid retention)
* Nodules (small lumps)
* Papules (small bumps)
* Irritation
* Dermatitis (skin inflammation)
* Pruritus (itching)

Less common side effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients) include:

* Acne
* Facial or eyelid edema
* Hypersensitivity or decreased skin sensation at the injection site
* Post-procedural discomfort (headache, toothache, jaw pain)
* Hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)
* Herpes labialis (cold sores)
* Basal-cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer â€“ though a causal link isn't definitively established)
* Injection-site ischemia (reduced blood flow)
* Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (inflammation of small blood vessels)

If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
The exact mechanism by which Azficel-T improves the appearance of nasolabial folds is not fully understood.  The product contains autologous fibroblasts (cells that produce collagen and other components of the skin's extracellular matrix).  Following injection, these cells are believed to either synthesize new extracellular matrix components or stimulate remodeling of existing tissue, ultimately leading to changes in skin structure, texture, and appearance at the injection site.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Azficel-T is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to Azficel-T or its components, including gentamicin, amphotericin, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or materials of bovine origin;  those with active facial infections; or those for whom allogeneic (from a different individual) use is planned.  Patients with certain genetic disorders are also advised against use.

* **Interactions:** Concomitant use of aspirin, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or anticoagulants (blood thinners) increases the risk of bleeding or bruising at the injection site. These medications are not recommended during Azficel-T treatment.  Chemotherapy drugs may also interfere with Azficel-T's function.

* **Warnings:** Patients with active autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressed individuals (including those undergoing chemotherapy), and patients with genetic disorders affecting collagen production should exercise caution.  There is an increased risk of bleeding and bruising, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, herpes labialis, basal-cell carcinoma, keloid and hypertrophic scarring, and hypersensitivity reactions.  Pregnancy category C:  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks to the fetus.  The effect on breastfeeding is unknown.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The effects of Azficel-T are not immediate and the full effect may not be seen for several weeks or months after the treatment series is completed.

* **Q: How long does the effect last?** A: The duration of the effect is not fully established, but it's not expected to last indefinitely. Further studies are needed.

* **Q: What is the process of getting Azficel-T?** A:  It begins with a skin biopsy to obtain the fibroblasts needed for cell culture. This process involves several weeks of manufacturing time before the injections can be administered by a qualified healthcare professional.

* **Q: Can I use Azficel-T on other areas of my face besides nasolabial folds?** A: No, its use is currently only approved for nasolabial folds.

* **Q: How should I store Azficel-T?** A:  Azficel-T is not stored by the patient; it is stored and prepared by specialized facilities.

* **Q:  What if I have a reaction to the injection?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.
