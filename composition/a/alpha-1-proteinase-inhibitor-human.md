# Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor Human
### Generic Name
Alpha-1 Proteinase Inhibitor (Human)

### Usage
Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (human) is a medication used for long-term augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults.  Its primary use is in treating individuals with a severe hereditary deficiency of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) who also exhibit clinically evident emphysema.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* indicated for treating lung disease in patients where an AAT deficiency hasn't been confirmed.  The long-term effects of chronic augmentation or maintenance therapy are not fully known.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The standard intravenous (IV) dosage is 60 mg/kg of body weight once a week.  It's important to note that the exact milligram strength per vial varies among manufacturers; always check the vial label for precise information before preparation and administration.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (human) in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are currently recommended by manufacturers for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Urinary tract infection
* Bruising at the injection site
* Muscle pain (myalgia)
* Respiratory tract infection
* Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* Cough

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**  These include, but are not limited to:  anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, various allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  increased liver enzyme levels,  and other symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, chills, chest pain, diarrhea, and many others.


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, immediately consult your healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (human) works by supplementing the body's naturally occurring alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is a crucial protease inhibitor in the serum; its main function is to neutralize proteolytic enzymes released during inflammation.  Hereditary AAT deficiency leads to a decrease in AAT levels, resulting in increased lung tissue damage and the development of emphysema. By providing supplemental AAT, this medication aims to reduce the damage caused by these uncontrolled enzymes.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe, immediate hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) to alpha-1-protease inhibitor products, and in IgA-deficient patients who possess antibodies against IgA.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. There's also a theoretical risk of transmitting infectious agents, including viruses, although manufacturing processes aim to mitigate this. Use with caution in patients at risk for fluid overload.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (human) is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  It is unknown whether this medication is excreted in breast milk. The benefits and risks of breastfeeding should be carefully considered against the potential effects on the infant.

**Other Precautions:** The medication is for intravenous infusion only and should not be mixed with other solutions or agents.  Always follow the specific administration instructions provided with the product.
