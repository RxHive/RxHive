# Amoxycillin + Dicloxacillin + Lactobacillus
### Generic Name
Amoxicillin + Dicloxacillin + Lactobacillus


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to treat bacterial infections, leveraging the synergistic effects of multiple antibiotics.  Amoxicillin is a penicillin-like antibiotic effective against a wide range of Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. Dicloxacillin, another penicillin-type antibiotic, is particularly effective against penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus (a bacterium resistant to many penicillins). The addition of Lactobacillus is intended to help mitigate the disruption of the gut microbiota often caused by antibiotic use.  The combined medication might be prescribed for infections such as skin infections, respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis, depending on the specific bacteria involved), and certain ear infections.  However, it's crucial to understand that this combination isn't suitable for all bacterial infections, and a doctor should determine the appropriate treatment based on the specific diagnosis.  The presence of Lactobacillus aims to prevent or reduce diarrhea and other gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with antibiotic therapy.  It's important to remember this combination should only be used under the direction of a physician; it is not a self-treatable condition.


### Dosage

Dosage will be determined by a physician based on the patient's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific bacterial cause.  There isn't a standardized dosage across all formulations.  Information presented below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for self-medication. **Always follow your doctor's instructions.**

* **Oral:** The amoxicillin and dicloxacillin components will be present as tablets or capsules, with the Lactobacillus provided separately as capsules or in a powder form (probiotics). Dosage instructions for the antibiotics are specific to the milligram strength of the formulation. For example, one regimen might consist of two 250mg Amoxicillin and one 250mg Dicloxacillin capsule three times a day, with a Lactobacillus supplement taken as directed.  Another regimen could involve higher or lower doses depending on the severity.


* **IV (Intravenous):** This combination is typically not administered intravenously. Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin are available for IV administration *separately*, but it's extremely rare to find a combined IV formulation, and its use would require close medical supervision.  The IV route is generally reserved for severe infections where oral administration is impractical.


* **Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage for children will be significantly lower than that for adults and will depend on weight and the specific infection.  A pediatrician should always determine the appropriate dosage.


### Side Effects

Common Side Effects:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Yeast infection (thrush)
* Headache


Less Common but Serious Side Effects:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis â€“ a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a severe form of diarrhea)
* Liver damage
* Kidney problems
* Seizures (more likely at high doses)


**Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Amoxicillin and dicloxacillin are both beta-lactam antibiotics that work by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  This interference leads to weakening of the bacterial cell wall, ultimately causing bacterial cell death.  Amoxicillin has a broader spectrum of activity than Dicloxacillin, meaning it can act against a wider range of bacteria. Dicloxacillin is specifically effective against penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that can resist many other penicillins. Lactobacillus, a probiotic, works by replenishing beneficial bacteria in the gut that may have been disrupted by the antibiotics, potentially reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not take this medication if you have a known allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins.  Inform your doctor of any previous allergic reactions to medications.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Amoxicillin and dicloxacillin can interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners) and oral contraceptives. Inform your physician of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** This medication should be used with caution in patients with kidney or liver problems. The dosage may need adjustment.
* **Children:** Pediatric dosage should be determined by a pediatrician.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other antibiotics?** A: No, do not take this or any other antibiotic without consulting your doctor. Combining antibiotics without medical supervision can be dangerous and ineffective.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A: It depends on the type and severity of the infection, as well as your individual response to the medication. Your doctor will assess the effectiveness of the treatment.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for everyone?** A: No. This medication is contraindicated for individuals with specific allergies or health conditions.  Always consult a healthcare provider to confirm suitability.
