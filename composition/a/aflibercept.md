# Aflibercept
### Generic Name
Aflibercept

### Usage
Aflibercept is a medication used to treat several eye conditions involving abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina (the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye).  Its primary use is in the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in older adults.  It's also used to treat diabetic macular edema (DME), a complication of diabetes affecting the macula (the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision), diabetic retinopathy (damage to the blood vessels in the retina caused by diabetes), and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), where a blocked vein in the retina causes swelling.  In all these conditions, Aflibercept works by targeting and inhibiting the growth of abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid and blood, causing vision impairment.

### Dosage
Aflibercept is administered as an intravitreal injection (directly into the vitreous gel inside the eye) by a qualified ophthalmologist.  Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated:

* **Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration:** The recommended initial dose is 2 mg (0.05 mL) injected into the eye every 4 weeks for the first 3 months.  Maintenance dosing may be adjusted to every 8 weeks or continue every 4 weeks depending on the response to treatment.  After a year of effective treatment, less frequent injections (every 12 weeks) may be considered, although 8-weekly dosing may be more effective.

* **Diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy:**  The initial treatment regimen typically involves 2 mg (0.05 mL) injections every 4 weeks for the first 5 injections. Maintenance dosing is similar to that used for wet AMD, with options for 4-weekly or 8-weekly injections.

* **Macular edema following retinal vein occlusion:** The usual dosage is 2 mg (0.05 mL) injected every 4 weeks.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of Aflibercept in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, but always consult with a physician before starting this medication if you have these conditions.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the conjunctiva, the membrane covering the white part of the eye)
* Cataract formation or worsening of existing cataracts
* Eye pain

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) â€“ which can damage the optic nerve if not controlled
* Vitreous floaters (spots or strands in your vision)
* Endophthalmitis (serious eye infection)
* Retinal detachment
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, severe allergic reactions)

If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor. VEGF is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of new blood vessels. In the eye conditions Aflibercept treats, abnormal blood vessel growth leads to fluid leakage and swelling, damaging the retina. Aflibercept acts as a decoy receptor, binding to VEGF and preventing it from stimulating the growth of these abnormal vessels. By blocking VEGF, Aflibercept reduces fluid leakage and swelling, helping to preserve vision.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Aflibercept is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, active ocular or periocular infection, and active intraocular inflammation.
* **Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions are currently known. However, always inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, that you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Aflibercept is classified as a Pregnancy Category C drug.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks to the fetus.  Women of reproductive age should use effective contraception before, during, and for at least 3 months after treatment.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while using Aflibercept.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be at increased risk for some side effects.
* **Ocular Infection:** Careful monitoring for signs of infection is crucial after injection.

### FAQs

* **How long does the treatment last?**  The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual's response and the specific condition. Regular follow-up appointments with your ophthalmologist are necessary to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

* **How is the medication stored?**  Store Aflibercept as directed by your physician or pharmacist.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your ophthalmologist as soon as possible to reschedule your injection.  Do not attempt to self-administer the medication.

* **Is this medication safe?**  Like all medications, Aflibercept carries potential risks and side effects.  However, when administered properly by a qualified ophthalmologist and monitored regularly, it is generally considered safe and effective for the treatment of its indicated conditions.
