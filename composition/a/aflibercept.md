# Aflibercept

**Generic Name:** Aflibercept

**Usage:** Aflibercept is a medication used to treat several eye conditions that cause vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina:

* **Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD):** This is the most common use.  Aflibercept slows the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, preventing further vision loss.
* **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME):** It reduces swelling in the macula caused by diabetes, improving vision.
* **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR):**  It can be used to treat vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, specifically DME.
* **Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO):**  It treats macular edema resulting from branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, aflibercept can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Eye-related:** Eye pain, redness, increased eye pressure (intraocular pressure), inflammation, bleeding in the eye, cataracts, retinal detachment, decreased visual acuity (blurry vision), floaters.
* **General:** Headache, fatigue, nasal congestion, increased risk of infection.
* **Serious Side Effects (require immediate medical attention):**  Sudden vision loss, severe eye pain, signs of infection.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary.  Always inform your doctor of any new or worsening symptoms.


**How it Works:** Aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.  VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels.  In the eye conditions listed above, abnormal blood vessels grow, leading to fluid leakage and swelling, damaging the retina. Aflibercept binds to VEGF, preventing it from stimulating the growth of these abnormal blood vessels. This reduces swelling and bleeding in the retina, helping to preserve vision.  It's administered directly into the eye via injection.


**FAQs:**

* **How often do I need injections?**  The frequency of injections varies depending on the condition being treated and individual response.  Your ophthalmologist will determine the appropriate schedule, which could range from every 4 to 8 weeks.

* **How long will I need treatment?**  Treatment is usually ongoing, as stopping treatment can lead to a recurrence of the condition.  The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your response.

* **Are there any interactions with other medications?**  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.

* **What are the risks of injection?**  While generally safe, intraocular injections carry a small risk of infection, bleeding, retinal detachment, and increased eye pressure. Your doctor will discuss these risks with you.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your ophthalmologist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially sudden vision loss, severe eye pain, or signs of infection.
