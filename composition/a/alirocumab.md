# Alirocumab
### Generic Name
Alirocumab

### Usage
Alirocumab is a medication used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often referred to as "bad" cholesterol.  It's primarily used as an add-on therapy for adults with high cholesterol, particularly those with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) who haven't reached their cholesterol goals with diet and other cholesterol-lowering medications like statins or ezetimibe.  It's also used in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a more severe form of high cholesterol, again in conjunction with other treatments.  Furthermore, Alirocumab helps reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.

### Dosage
Alirocumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).  Dosage varies depending on the individual's condition and response to treatment.

* **Primary Hyperlipidemia:** The initial dose is typically 75 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks.  The dose may be increased to a maximum of 150 mg every two weeks if needed to achieve adequate LDL-C reduction. For patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia undergoing LDL apheresis, the initial dose is 150 mg every two weeks.

* **Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia:** The initial dose is 150 mg every two weeks.

* **Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events:** The initial dose is typically 75 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 150 mg every two weeks if needed.

**Important Considerations:** When switching between dosing regimens, the new dose should begin on the next scheduled date.  LDL-C levels should be reassessed 4-8 weeks after any dosage change.  This medication is not approved for use in children.  Dosage adjustments for those with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment are generally not necessary; however,  specific guidance for severe impairment is not provided in the manufacturer's labeling, consult your physician.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include injection site reactions.  Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include diarrhea, bruising, liver enzyme abnormalities, hypersensitivity reactions, development of antibodies, influenza-like symptoms, myalgia (muscle pain), muscle spasms, and cough.  Less common, but potentially serious side effects include angioedema (severe swelling), hypersensitivity vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels), and a significant decrease in LDL cholesterol.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Alirocumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called PCSK9.  PCSK9 normally binds to LDL receptors in the liver, preventing them from removing LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.  By blocking PCSK9, Alirocumab allows more LDL receptors to function, leading to increased removal of LDL cholesterol and consequently lowering LDL-C levels.

### Precautions
Alirocumab is contraindicated in individuals with a serious hypersensitivity to the medication or its components.  There's an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, some of which can be severe and require hospitalization.  While not specifically contraindicated, careful consideration should be given to the benefits and risks of using Alirocumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Patients should inform their healthcare provider of all other medications they are taking, as drug interactions are possible.
