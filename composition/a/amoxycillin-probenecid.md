# Amoxycillin + Probenecid
### Generic Name
Amoxicillin + Probenecid


### Usage

Amoxicillin + Probenecid is a combination medication used primarily to treat certain types of bacterial infections.  Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that effectively combats a wide range of bacteria. Probenecid works by preventing the kidneys from eliminating amoxicillin too quickly from the body. This allows amoxicillin to remain in the bloodstream for a longer duration, leading to improved effectiveness against the infection.

The primary use of this combination is in treating infections caused by bacteria susceptible to amoxicillin, particularly when higher and more sustained levels of the antibiotic are needed.  This might include cases where the infection is severe, or where the bacteria are known to be less sensitive to amoxicillin alone.  It's not a first-line treatment for all bacterial infections and is generally prescribed when other penicillin antibiotics or amoxicillin alone are deemed insufficient.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  It's crucial to follow the prescription precisely as directed by a healthcare professional.  There is no standard pediatric or adult oral dosage as the amount of amoxicillin and probenecid varies based on the specific need and the doctor's clinical judgment.

**It's imperative to note:** This medication is only available via prescription and should never be self-administered. The dosage must always be determined by a physician.  There's no safe or recommended way to calculate dosage without professional medical guidance.  Oral and IV formulations may differ significantly; never attempt to switch routes of administration without explicit instruction from a doctor.



### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach pain
* Skin rash
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention)
* Liver problems
* Blood disorders


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  By disrupting this process, amoxicillin prevents bacteria from multiplying and eventually leads to their death.  Probenecid, a uricosuric agent, inhibits the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. This means it blocks the kidneys from actively removing amoxicillin from the bloodstream. As a result, amoxicillin remains in the body longer at higher concentrations, increasing its effectiveness against the infection. The combination maximizes the therapeutic benefits of amoxicillin.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to penicillins or any components of the medication should absolutely avoid this combination.
* **Kidney Disease:** Patients with impaired kidney function may require dosage adjustments, and careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Liver Disease:** Individuals with liver problems should use this medication cautiously, as it might exacerbate existing liver issues.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with certain drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), methotrexate, and others. Always inform your physician about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Alcohol:** While not a direct contraindication, excessive alcohol consumption can negatively impact liver function and should be avoided during treatment.
