# Atropine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Atropine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Atropine ophthalmic solution or ointment is primarily used to temporarily paralyze the muscles of the eye.  This has two main applications:

* **Penalization of the healthy eye in amblyopia treatment:**  Amblyopia, often called "lazy eye," is a condition where one eye doesn't develop normal vision.  Atropine is used to blur the vision in the stronger eye, forcing the weaker eye to work harder and improve its vision.

* **Mydriasis and cycloplegia:** Atropine causes the pupil to dilate (mydriasis) and temporarily paralyzes the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia), which controls focusing. This is useful for various ophthalmologic examinations, such as refraction (eyeglass prescription determination) and retinal examinations.  It can also be used to treat certain inflammatory conditions of the iris and uveal tract.

Less common, off-label uses include the treatment of excessive respiratory secretions in some specific situations. This is not a standard or recommended use.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Amblyopia (healthy eye penalization):**  1% solution: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctiva of the healthy eye 40 minutes before the desired maximal dilation.  The dose may be repeated up to twice daily (BID) as needed.
* **Mydriasis/cycloplegia:** 1% solution: Instill 1 drop into the conjunctiva 40 minutes before the desired maximal dilation.  The dose may be repeated up to twice daily (BID) as needed. 1% ointment: Apply a small amount into the conjunctival sac once or twice daily.
* **Off-label use (terminal respiratory secretions):**  Using a 1% ophthalmic solution sublingually. Initial dose: 1-2 drops every 2-4 hours. Usual dose: 2-4 drops every 2-4 hours.  *This use is not standard and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.*


**Children:**

Dosage varies significantly based on age and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow a physician's instructions carefully.  Generally, for amblyopia and mydriasis/cycloplegia in children aged 3 and older, the dosage is similar to adults, but the maximum daily dose should be carefully monitored by a healthcare professional. For infants and children under 3, dosages are usually lower and should only be determined by a pediatrician or ophthalmologist.  The use of atropine in this population requires careful monitoring.


**Important Note:**  The information above is a summary; always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia), stinging or burning sensation in the eye, dry mouth (xerostomia), dilated pupils.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased heart rate (tachycardia), increased blood pressure,  restlessness, irritability,  difficulty urinating, skin rashes, severe allergic reactions.


If any side effects occur, especially those listed as serious, seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works

Atropine is an anticholinergic medication. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the muscles of the eye to contract. By blocking acetylcholine, atropine allows the muscles that dilate the pupil to relax and the pupil dilates. It also paralyzes the ciliary muscle responsible for focusing the eye.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Atropine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to atropine or any component of the formulation and in those with primary glaucoma or a tendency towards narrow-angle glaucoma (ointment only).
* **Interactions:** Atropine can interact with many other medications, including those used to treat respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal issues, and other neurological conditions.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any other medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Atropine crosses the placenta and may be present in breast milk.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks, and only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Other Precautions:** Atropine should be used cautiously in patients with brain damage, Down syndrome, or spastic paralysis.  Patients should be advised of the potential for blurred vision and light sensitivity.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the effect of atropine last?** A: The duration of action varies depending on the concentration and formulation (solution or ointment) but typically lasts several hours to a few days.
* **Q: Can I drive after using atropine eye drops?** A: Blurred vision is a common side effect; avoid driving or operating machinery until your vision has cleared.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get atropine in my other eye?** A:  Rinse the eye thoroughly with lukewarm water. Contact your doctor or ophthalmologist.
* **Q: How should I store atropine eye drops/ointment?** A: Store according to the instructions on the label, typically at room temperature away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Is atropine eye drops addictive?** A: No, atropine eye drops are not addictive.
