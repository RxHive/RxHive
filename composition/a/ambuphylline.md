# Ambuphylline
### Generic Name
Ambuphylline (or Bufylline)

### Usage
Ambuphylline, a combination of theophylline and aminoisobutanol, was primarily used as a bronchodilator to treat symptoms associated with respiratory tract disorders, such as coughs and other conditions causing airway narrowing.  It worked by relaxing the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier.  Note that this medication is currently discontinued from the market and is no longer available for prescription.

### Dosage
Dosage information for ambuphylline is not readily available due to its discontinuation.  Prescribing information would have varied based on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup, injection), the patient's age, weight, and the severity of their condition.  It's crucial to understand that *any information found outside official, current medical resources is unreliable and should not be used for treatment.*

### Side Effects
Because ambuphylline is no longer available, a comprehensive list of side effects from reliable sources cannot be provided.  However, given its composition and the known effects of theophylline, potential side effects may have included:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Headache
* Restlessness or nervousness
* Insomnia
* Heart palpitations
* Digestive upset

Serious, but less common side effects may have also occurred.  It is essential to consult a healthcare provider for appropriate medical advice and treatment options for respiratory conditions.

### How it Works
Ambuphylline's bronchodilating effect stemmed from its theophylline component. Theophylline works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP).  Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of the smooth muscles in the airways, resulting in bronchodilation and easier breathing.  The aminoisobutanol component likely enhanced or modified the theophylline's effects, though the exact mechanism isn't definitively detailed in readily available literature due to the drug's discontinuation.


### Precautions
Again, because ambuphylline is no longer marketed, detailed precautions are unavailable from reliable sources.  However, based on its components, precautions likely included considerations for:

* **Interactions with other medications:** Theophylline can interact with numerous drugs, potentially increasing or decreasing their effects.  
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:**  Theophylline and its derivatives should be used cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding, only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. A doctor should be consulted before using.
* **Children:**  Dosage adjustments were likely necessary for children based on their age and weight.
* **Individuals with specific medical conditions:**  Patients with certain cardiac, liver, or kidney conditions likely required careful monitoring while taking ambuphylline.

*Note:*  This information is based on the known properties of its constituent parts. Due to the drug's unavailability, complete and accurate details regarding precautions are limited.
