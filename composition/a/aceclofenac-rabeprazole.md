# Aceclofenac + Rabeprazole
### Generic Name
Aceclofenac + Rabeprazole

### Usage
Aceclofenac + Rabeprazole is a combination medication used primarily to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing inflammation and pain. Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces stomach acid production.  The combination is particularly useful because NSAIDs like aceclofenac can irritate the stomach lining and increase the risk of ulcers.  The addition of rabeprazole helps to protect the stomach lining and minimize this risk, making it a safer option for long-term pain management.  While primarily used for musculoskeletal pain, it may sometimes be prescribed off-label for other conditions causing pain and inflammation, but this should always be under the direct supervision of a doctor.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the individual's condition, age, and overall health.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescription precisely.  Generally, the medication comes in tablet form for oral administration.  There isn't a standard pediatric formulation readily available, so its use in children is generally not recommended and should only be considered under very specific circumstances and with close medical supervision.  

**Typical adult dosage:**  The usual dose is one tablet once or twice daily, typically taken with food to minimize stomach upset.  However,  dosing will be determined by your physician based on your specific needs.  

**Important:**  This information is for general understanding only.  Never adjust your dosage without consulting your doctor.  Incorrect dosing can lead to serious health consequences. There is no IV formulation of this combined medication.

### How it Works
Aceclofenac, an NSAID, works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin production, aceclofenac alleviates pain and reduces swelling in affected joints and tissues.  Rabeprazole, a PPI, reduces stomach acid production by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for secreting acid into the stomach.  This protective action reduces the risk of NSAID-induced stomach ulcers and irritation.


### Precautions
