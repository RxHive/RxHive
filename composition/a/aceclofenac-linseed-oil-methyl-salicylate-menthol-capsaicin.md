### Usage

This topical gel is primarily used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions.  This includes:

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.

If you experience any adverse effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

This topical gel combines several active ingredients that work synergistically to provide pain relief:

* **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.
* **Linseed Oil:** A natural emollient that softens and soothes the skin.  It also may possess some anti-inflammatory properties.
* **Methyl Salicylate:** A counterirritant that produces a warming sensation and helps to reduce pain by stimulating blood flow.
* **Menthol:** A counterirritant that produces a cooling sensation and helps to numb the affected area.
* **Capsaicin:** Derived from chili peppers, capsaicin depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain signaling, leading to pain relief.

The combined action of these ingredients provides multifaceted pain relief through both anti-inflammatory and counterirritant mechanisms.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Avoid use if you have a known allergy to any of the ingredients.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this product if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Open Wounds:** Do not apply to open wounds or broken skin.
