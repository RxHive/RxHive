# Azithromycin

**Generic Name:** Azithromycin

**Usage:** Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngitis (strep throat), sinusitis.
* **Skin infections:** Cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo.
* **Ear infections:** Otitis media (middle ear infection).
* **Sexually transmitted infections (STIs):** Chlamydia, gonorrhea (in some cases, usually in combination with another antibiotic).
* **Other infections:**  Lyme disease, certain types of eye infections.

**Note:** Azithromycin is only effective against bacterial infections. It will not work for viral infections like the common cold or flu.  Always consult a doctor to determine the appropriate antibiotic for your specific infection.  Improper use can lead to antibiotic resistance.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, azithromycin can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.  These are often mild and temporary.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (rare but serious).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience an allergic reaction.
* **Liver problems:**  Rare but can be serious; symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Heart problems:**  Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality), especially in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Hearing problems:**  Temporary or permanent hearing loss (rare).

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more information and to report any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:** Azithromycin works by preventing bacteria from producing proteins necessary for their growth and survival.  It binds to the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.
