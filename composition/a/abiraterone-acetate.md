# Abiraterone Acetate

**Generic Name:** Abiraterone Acetate

**Usage:** Abiraterone acetate is used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  It's typically used in combination with prednisone or prednisolone (corticosteroids).  It may be used after chemotherapy has failed or as a first-line treatment in certain situations, always under the guidance of an oncologist.  Its use is specific to prostate cancer and not other cancers.

**Side Effects:**  Abiraterone acetate can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  These include:

* **Common:**  High blood pressure (hypertension), fluid retention (edema), low potassium (hypokalemia), hot flashes, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, increased cholesterol, muscle pain (myalgia), increased liver enzymes.
* **Serious:** Heart problems (including heart failure), abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), stroke, blood clots, liver problems (including liver damage or failure), high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), adrenal insufficiency (decreased function of the adrenal glands).
* **Other potential effects:**  Elevated blood pressure, dizziness, swelling, and increased risk of infections may also occur.

The severity and frequency of side effects vary among individuals.  It is crucial to report any concerning symptoms to a healthcare provider immediately.

**How it Works:** Abiraterone acetate is a CYP17 enzyme inhibitor.  The CYP17 enzyme is involved in the production of androgens (male hormones) which fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells, even after castration (removal of the testicles or medical castration). By blocking this enzyme, abiraterone acetate reduces the production of androgens, thereby slowing or stopping the growth of prostate cancer cells.  The combination with prednisone/prednisolone further enhances this effect and helps to manage some side effects.
