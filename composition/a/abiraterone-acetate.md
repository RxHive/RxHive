# Abiraterone Acetate
### Generic Name
Abiraterone Acetate

### Usage
Abiraterone acetate is primarily used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  This means it's used in men with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and no longer responds to hormone therapy (castration, or removal of the testes, or drugs that block testosterone).  It works by blocking the production of certain hormones, specifically androgens, which fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells.  While its primary use is in mCRPC, it's often used in combination with other medications, such as prednisone, to maximize its effectiveness.  It is *not* a first-line treatment for prostate cancer.


### Dosage
Dosage of abiraterone acetate varies depending on the individual and the specific treatment regimen.  It's typically administered orally as a tablet.  

* **Adults with mCRPC:** The usual dose is 1000 mg once daily, taken orally with food.  This is often given in combination with prednisone (a corticosteroid). The specific prednisone dosage will be determined by the prescribing physician.

* **Children:** Abiraterone acetate is not approved for use in children.

* **IV Administration:** Abiraterone acetate is not given intravenously. It is only administered orally.

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on factors such as liver or kidney function.  Your doctor will carefully monitor your health and adjust the dosage as needed.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions precisely regarding the dose and timing of medication.


### Side Effects
Abiraterone acetate, like many medications, can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.

* **Common side effects:**  These include fluid retention (edema), high blood pressure (hypertension), low potassium levels (hypokalemia), increased cholesterol levels, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and dizziness.

* **Serious, but less common side effects:**  These include heart problems (arrhythmias, heart failure), liver problems (hepatotoxicity), infections, and adrenal insufficiency (where the adrenal glands don't produce enough hormones).

* **Important Note:**  If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.  Early intervention can help manage or mitigate potential problems.


### How it Works
Abiraterone acetate is a CYP17 inhibitor.  This means it works by blocking the enzyme CYP17, which plays a crucial role in the production of androgens in the adrenal glands and testes.  By inhibiting this enzyme, abiraterone acetate significantly reduces the levels of androgens in the body.  Since androgens are essential for the growth and survival of many prostate cancer cells, lowering their levels can slow or stop the growth of the cancer.  The combination with prednisone often helps manage some of the side effects of abiraterone acetate's inhibition of androgen production.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Abiraterone acetate should not be used by people with severe liver or kidney problems or those who are allergic to abiraterone acetate or any of its components.  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take this medication.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Abiraterone acetate can interact with several other medications.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting treatment with abiraterone acetate.  Specific interactions can necessitate dosage adjustments or alternative treatment approaches.

* **Specific Warnings:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to certain side effects.  Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function is essential during treatment.  Patients should be aware of potential cardiovascular risks and should inform their doctor of any heart conditions.

* **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests are needed to monitor kidney and liver function, electrolytes (particularly potassium), and cholesterol levels during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take abiraterone acetate?**  A: The duration of treatment depends on your individual response to the medication and the progression of your cancer.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking abiraterone acetate?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.  Alcohol can interact with certain medications and may exacerbate some side effects.

* **Q: How should I store abiraterone acetate?** A: Store abiraterone acetate tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns about missed doses.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of abiraterone acetate?** A: The long-term effects of abiraterone acetate are still being studied.  Regular monitoring by your physician is critical to assess your response and manage any potential side effects.  Your doctor can provide more specific information regarding your situation.
