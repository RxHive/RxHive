# Abatacept
### Generic Name
Abatacept

### Usage
Abatacept is a medication used to treat several autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation and joint pain.  Its primary use is in the management of moderately to severely active adult rheumatoid arthritis.  It's also approved for treating polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (in children over 2 years old) and psoriatic arthritis (in adults).  Abatacept can be used alone or in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs),  *except* for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous).  Always follow your doctor's precise instructions.

**Adult Dosage (Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis):**

* **Intravenous (IV):** The initial dose is weight-based:  500 mg for patients under 60 kg, 750 mg for those between 60 and 100 kg, and 1000 mg for those over 100 kg. This initial dose is repeated at 2 and 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks thereafter.

* **Subcutaneous (SubQ):**  The typical dose is 125 mg once weekly.  A doctor may prescribe an initial IV loading dose followed by the weekly SubQ injections. For psoriatic arthritis, the SubQ dose is usually initiated without an IV loading dose.  

**Pediatric Dosage (Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis):**

* **Intravenous (IV):**  Not recommended for children under 6 years old. For children 6 years and older: 10 mg/kg for those weighing less than 75 kg; 750 mg for those weighing 75-100 kg; and 1000 mg for those over 100 kg.  The initial dose is repeated at 2 and 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks thereafter.

* **Subcutaneous (SubQ):** Not established for children under 2 years old.  For children 2 years and older:  The dose is weight-based: 50 mg weekly for those weighing 10 to less than 25 kg, 87.5 mg weekly for those weighing 25 to less than 50 kg, and 125 mg weekly for those weighing 50 kg or more.  An IV loading dose is typically not used.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are currently recommended based on liver or kidney impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.  However, always consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These can occur in more than 10% of patients and typically include headache, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infections (like the common cold or bronchitis). The development of antibodies against abatacept is also relatively common.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, serious side effects can include serious infections (including tuberculosis and sepsis), allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis), and certain types of cancer (though the link isn't fully established in all cases).

**Other Reported Side Effects:**  Other side effects, reported with varying frequency, include dizziness, hypertension, skin rash, dyspepsia (indigestion), urinary tract infections, and injection site reactions (with subcutaneous administration).

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Abatacept is a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator. It works by targeting a specific part of the immune system's response involved in the inflammation that characterizes autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.  Abatacept binds to proteins (CD80 and CD86) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).  This binding prevents the APCs from fully activating T-cells, thereby reducing the inflammatory response in the affected joints and tissues.  Essentially, it helps to dampen the overactive immune response responsible for the symptoms of these conditions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Abatacept is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components and in those with active sepsis or at high risk of sepsis (e.g., severely immunocompromised individuals).

* **Interactions:** Avoid use with TNF antagonists due to increased risk of serious infections.  The use of Abatacept with other biologic DMARDs or Janus kinase inhibitors is not recommended.  Abatacept can interfere with some blood glucose monitoring systems.

* **Warnings:**  Patients should be monitored closely for signs of infection and hypersensitivity reactions. There's an increased risk of serious infections and malignancy, though more research is needed to establish definitive links. Use caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the elderly, and those with a history of recurrent infections.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Abatacept is a pregnancy category C drug (meaning potential risk to the fetus is not fully established). Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking abatacept.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Abatacept?** A: The time to see improvement can vary, but many patients notice a reduction in symptoms within several weeks or months.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Abatacept suddenly?** A: No.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment, as sudden discontinuation might worsen your condition.

* **Q: How should I store Abatacept?** A:  Storage instructions will vary depending on whether you're using the intravenous or subcutaneous formulation; always follow the directions on the medication packaging.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses. Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Are there any specific diet recommendations while on Abatacept?** A:  There are no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet is generally recommended for overall well-being.  If you have other medical conditions impacting diet, discuss them with your physician and registered dietician.
