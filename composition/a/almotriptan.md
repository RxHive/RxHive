# Almotriptan
### Generic Name
Almotriptan

### Usage
Almotriptan is a triptan medication primarily used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults and adolescents (12-17 years old) with a history of migraine.  This means it's taken *when* a migraine begins, not to prevent migraines from happening. It's effective for migraines with or without an aura (the sensory disturbances that can precede a migraine).  Almotriptan is not intended for the prophylactic treatment of migraine or for cluster headaches.  It's important to note that a diagnosis of migraine should be confirmed before using almotriptan.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual starting dose is 6.25 mg to 12.5 mg orally. If the headache returns after taking the first dose, a second dose can be taken after 2 hours, but the total daily dose should not exceed 25 mg. The safety of using almotriptan to treat more than four migraines in a 30-day period hasn't been fully established.

**Adolescents (12-17 years old):** The dosage is the same as for adults (6.25 mg to 12.5 mg), but efficacy on migraine-associated symptoms hasn't been fully established in this age group. The safety and efficacy of almotriptan in children under 12 years old haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver problems):** Start with a lower dose (6.25 mg) and do not exceed 12.5 mg in a 24-hour period.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney problems):** For severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance â‰¤ 30 mL/min), start with a dose of 6.25 mg and do not exceed 12.5 mg in a 24-hour period.

Almotriptan is usually taken orally as a tablet.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness

If you experience any concerning side effects, including those not listed here, stop taking almotriptan and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Almotriptan is a selective agonist of serotonin (5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub>) receptors in the brain.  These receptors play a role in the mechanisms that cause migraines.  By activating these receptors, almotriptan causes vasoconstriction (narrowing) of blood vessels in the brain, reducing the inflammation and pain associated with migraines.  It also helps to reduce the release of neuropeptides, which are substances that contribute to migraine pain signaling.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Almotriptan is contraindicated in people with hypersensitivity to almotriptan or its components, hemiplegic or basilar migraine, known or suspected ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular syndromes, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or those who have recently taken another 5-HT1 agonist or ergotamine derivatives.
* **Interactions:**  Almotriptan can interact with several other medications, including MAO inhibitors, certain antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs), other triptans, and ergot derivatives.  Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking before starting almotriptan.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac rhythm disturbances, the elderly, and those with a history of sulfonamide allergy.  Almotriptan is category C in pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been established.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients taking almotriptan may have an increased risk of cardiovascular events, cerebrovascular syndromes, increased blood pressure, and serotonin syndrome.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take almotriptan with other migraine medications?** A: No, avoid taking almotriptan with other triptans, ergot derivatives, or MAO inhibitors without consulting your doctor.
* **Q: How should I store almotriptan?** A: Store almotriptan at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I drive after taking almotriptan?** A:  Because drowsiness and dizziness are possible side effects, avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how almotriptan affects you.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Almotriptan is for acute migraine treatment; you only take it when you have a migraine.  Don't take a double dose.
* **Q: Can I use almotriptan to prevent migraines?** A: No, almotriptan is only for treating a migraine attack once it has started, not for prevention.  Speak with your doctor about migraine prevention strategies.
