# Artesunate + Lumefantrine
### Generic Name
Artesunate + Lumefantrine

### Usage
Artesunate + lumefantrine is a combination antimalarial medication used to treat uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, the most dangerous species of malaria parasite.  It's particularly effective against multi-drug resistant strains of *P. falciparum*, making it a crucial treatment option in many regions. While primarily used for uncomplicated malaria, its use in severe malaria is *not* recommended; severe malaria requires different and more intensive treatment.  This combination therapy targets different stages of the parasite's life cycle, increasing its effectiveness.

### Dosage

Dosage depends on the patient's weight and age. It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage exactly as directed by a healthcare professional.  The medication is usually available in tablet form.  **There is no IV formulation of artesunate + lumefantrine.**

**Adult Dosage (weighing 50 kg or more):** A typical course consists of six doses taken over three days.  The specific number of tablets per dose varies depending on the formulation and the patient's weight.  Always refer to the packaging instructions or consult a healthcare professional for the exact regimen.

**Children's Dosage:**  The dosage for children is determined by their weight and is usually calculated per kilogram of body weight.  Pediatric formulations may be available, but it's essential to consult a doctor or pharmacist for the appropriate dosage based on the child's age and weight.  Never give an adult dose to a child.

**Administration:** The tablets should be taken with food to minimize gastrointestinal upset.  It's essential to complete the full course of treatment even if symptoms improve, to prevent relapse and the development of drug resistance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Loss of appetite
* Skin rash

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality that can be dangerous)
* Seizures
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)


If any serious side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.  Even seemingly minor side effects warrant a call to your doctor if they persist or are severe.

### How it Works

Artesunate and lumefantrine work synergistically to eliminate the malaria parasite.  Artesunate rapidly clears the parasite from the bloodstream by targeting the asexual blood stages of *P. falciparum*. Lumefantrine then prevents the parasite from reproducing, preventing future infections and relapses.  This dual-action mechanism increases treatment effectiveness and reduces the likelihood of drug resistance developing.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Artesunate + lumefantrine should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to either artesunate or lumefantrine.  It should also be avoided in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with other drugs, particularly those metabolized by the liver, such as certain anticonvulsants. It's vital to inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of artesunate + lumefantrine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare professional.  The benefits of treatment must be weighed against potential risks.

* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Careful monitoring is necessary.

* **Heart Conditions:** Patients with pre-existing heart conditions should be monitored closely due to the potential for QT interval prolongation.
