# Ambroxol + Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride
### Generic Name
Ambroxol + Guaifenesin + Phenylephrine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Ammonium Chloride


### Usage

This combination medication is a multi-symptom cold and cough remedy typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold, bronchitis, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines several active ingredients to target different aspects of these illnesses:

* **Ambroxol:** A mucolytic agent that thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up. This helps to clear congestion in the airways.
* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that assists in removing mucus from the respiratory tract. It works by increasing the fluid content of mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that shrinks swollen blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving stuffiness and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps reduce runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes associated with allergies or colds.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** An expectorant that helps to liquefy mucus, aiding in its removal from the respiratory tract.  It works by altering the pH of the mucus.


This combination aims to provide relief from several common cold and flu symptoms simultaneously â€“ cough, congestion, runny nose, and sneezing.  It's crucial to remember that this medication *treats symptoms*, not the underlying infection itself.  A viral infection like the common cold will usually resolve on its own.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary significantly depending on the specific formulation (e.g., tablet, syrup, liquid) and the age and weight of the patient.  **Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.**  Do not exceed the recommended dose.

### How it Works

As detailed in the "Usage" section, each ingredient works independently to target specific symptoms:  Ambroxol and Guaifenesin loosen and expel mucus; Phenylephrine reduces nasal congestion; Chlorpheniramine Maleate counteracts allergy-related symptoms; and Ammonium Chloride further assists in mucus liquefaction.  The combined effect aims for comprehensive relief from cold and flu symptoms.
