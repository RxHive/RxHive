# Avapritinib
### Generic Name
Avapritinib

### Usage
Avapritinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat adults with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) that have a specific mutation in the *PDGFRA* gene, particularly exon 18 mutations, including the *PDGFRA* D842V mutation.  This means it's used for GISTs that haven't responded well to other treatments or cannot be surgically removed.  It works by specifically targeting a protein involved in the growth and spread of these types of tumors.  Currently, Avapritinib is not approved for use in children.

### Dosage

The typical adult dose is 300 mg once daily (OD) by mouth, taken on an empty stomach (at least one hour before or two hours after a meal). This dosage continues until the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the severity of side effects experienced.  Reductions are typically made in 100mg increments down to 100mg.  Treatment will be discontinued if 100mg is still not tolerated. Specific guidelines for dosage reduction based on side effects are provided by a physician and should be followed carefully.  Avapritinib is not currently approved for pediatric use, therefore no pediatric dosage is available.  Dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal impairment are not clearly defined in current labeling and should be addressed with a healthcare provider.

### Side Effects

Avapritinib can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but more serious.  Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* **Nervous system:** Fatigue, dizziness, headache, sleep disturbances, mood changes, cognitive impairment.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.
* **Skin:** Rash, hair discoloration, hair loss (alopecia).
* **Cardiovascular:** Edema (swelling).
* **Metabolic/Endocrine:** Changes in blood levels of phosphate, potassium, albumin, magnesium, sodium; altered taste.
* **Hematologic:** Low white blood cell count, low platelet count, changes in blood clotting factors.
* **Hepatic:** Elevated liver enzymes.
* **Other:** Weakness, shortness of breath, pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs), fever.

Less common but potentially serious side effects include intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), severe abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, severe vomiting, and various other neurological and cardiovascular effects.  Any new or worsening symptoms, especially those listed above, should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Avapritinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by selectively blocking the activity of certain mutated forms of the proteins KIT and PDGFRA. These proteins are involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell growth and division.  In GISTs with *PDGFRA* exon 18 mutations, these proteins are often abnormally active, leading to uncontrolled tumor growth. Avapritinib's inhibition of these proteins helps to slow or stop the growth of these cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Avapritinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least six weeks after the final dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for two weeks after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avapritinib's metabolism can be affected by other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Specifically, strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers can alter Avapritinib levels and its effectiveness or risk of side effects.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients with pre-existing conditions, particularly cardiovascular or neurological problems, should be carefully monitored. Regular blood tests to monitor blood counts and liver function are often recommended.  The risk of intracranial hemorrhage is increased with Avapritinib use, warranting close monitoring for any neurological symptoms.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Avapritinib with food?** A: No, Avapritinib should be taken on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a missed dose if it is within 8 hours of your next scheduled dose.  Take the next dose as scheduled and don't double up on doses.
* **Q: How should I store Avapritinib?** A: Store Avapritinib as directed by your doctor or pharmacist. Typically, it should be stored at room temperature away from light and moisture.
* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of Avapritinib?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring is needed to detect and manage any potential side effects.  Discuss long-term concerns with your healthcare provider.
* **Q:  When should I seek medical attention?** A:  Seek medical attention immediately if you experience severe or worsening side effects, especially those listed in the side effects section.  Don't hesitate to contact your doctor or healthcare provider with any concerns.
