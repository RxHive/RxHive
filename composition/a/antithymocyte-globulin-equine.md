# Antithymocyte Globulin Equine
### Generic Name
Antithymocyte Globulin Equine

### Usage
Antithymocyte globulin equine (ATG) is primarily used as an immunosuppressant.  Its main applications are in treating moderate-to-severe aplastic anemia in patients unsuitable for bone marrow transplantation, and in managing allograft rejection in renal transplantation.  In renal transplantation, ATG is used alongside standard therapy to improve the success rate of overcoming acute rejection episodes.  While not its primary use, ATG has also seen off-label application in skin allograft situations.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Premedication with an antihistamine, corticosteroids, and/or an antipyretic is often recommended before ATG administration.  Concomitant immunosuppressants are also usually given. Dosage is highly variable and depends on the specific condition and patient response.  Always follow a physician's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Renal Allograft (Kidney Transplant):** Intravenous (IV) administration.  The usual daily dose ranges from 10-30 mg/kg.  Specific regimens vary depending on whether it's for preventing rejection (starting within 24 hours of transplant) or treating an existing rejection episode.  Typical regimens involve daily doses for 14 days, followed by doses every other day for another 14 days.
* **Aplastic Anemia:** Intravenous (IV) administration. The typical regimen involves daily doses of 10-20 mg/kg for 8-14 days, followed by doses every other day up to a total of 21 doses over 28 days.  Alternative, higher-dose regimens (40 mg/kg daily for four days combined with cyclosporine) exist but are off-label uses.
* **Skin Allograft (Off-Label):** IV administration. Dosing is highly variable and depends greatly on the individual case. It may start with a loading dose before the allograft and continue until sufficient graft coverage is achieved.

**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for renal allograft rejection and aplastic anemia generally follows similar mg/kg guidelines as adults, but the specific dose will be determined by the physician based on the child's weight and condition.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Chills
* Headache
* Skin rash (including urticaria and pruritus)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% or less, but potentially severe):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Serum sickness
* Hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells)
* Various other organ-specific side effects affecting the cardiovascular, nervous, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, and respiratory systems (see detailed list in the original document).


**If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.**


### How it Works

Antithymocyte globulin equine is a polyclonal antibody preparation derived from horse serum. It works by targeting and eliminating T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell crucial in the immune response.  By depleting these cells, ATG suppresses the immune system, reducing the risk of allograft rejection in transplant patients and potentially allowing the body to recover from aplastic anemia. ATG might also alter the function of T-lymphocytes rather than solely eliminating them.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** ATG is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions (such as anaphylaxis) to prior ATG or other equine gamma-globulins.
* **Drug Interactions:** ATG can interact with other immunosuppressants, live vaccines, and certain medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.  Live vaccines should be avoided during and around the time of ATG treatment.
* **Warnings:** ATG carries a risk of anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical attention.  Close monitoring during infusion is crucial.  There's also an increased risk of hematologic toxicity (affecting blood cells), infections, and impaired liver and kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** ATG is a Category C drug during pregnancy. It is not recommended for treating aplastic anemia in pregnant women.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration of the risks and benefits for both mother and infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is ATG administered?** A: ATG is administered intravenously (IV) over a period of several hours.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The response time varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual patient.
* **Q: How is ATG stored?** A:  Refer to the specific product labeling for storage instructions.
* **Q: Are there alternatives to ATG?** A: Yes, other immunosuppressants exist; your doctor will determine the most appropriate treatment.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects to your doctor immediately. Some side effects are serious and require immediate medical attention.
