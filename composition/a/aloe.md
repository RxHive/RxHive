# Aloe
### Generic Name
Aloe

### Usage

Aloe is primarily used topically to soothe and heal the skin.  It's effective in relieving symptoms associated with various dermatological conditions including contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), other forms of dermatitis, acne urticaria, first and second-degree burns, radiation dermatitis, and sunburn.  Its soothing properties also help alleviate pain and inflammation related to these conditions, and it aids in wound healing.

While oral aloe preparations are sometimes used for conditions like obesity, diabetes, and osteoarthritis,  scientific evidence supporting these uses is lacking and unreliable.  Therefore, these uses are not recommended based on current medical understanding.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using aloe for any internal condition.


### Dosage

**Topical Application (for dermatological conditions, pain, inflammation, wound healing):**  Apply a small amount (3-5 mg) of aloe gel to the affected area as needed.  The exact amount will depend on the size of the affected area.

**Oral Administration (Not recommended due to lack of evidence, but included for informational purposes):**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific oral preparation (capsule, liquid, tincture).  Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.  Examples include:

*   **Leaf gel capsules:** 50-200 mg per day.
*   **Liquid preparations:** 30 mL three times daily (TID).
*   **Tinctures:** 15-60 drops as needed.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Oral ingestion of aloe is contraindicated (not recommended) in children under 12 years old.  Topical use in children should be under the guidance of a pediatrician.


### Side Effects

*   Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
*   Burning and itching of the skin (infrequent)
*   Stomach pain and cramps (especially with high oral doses)
*   Diarrhea
*   Kidney problems (hematuria - blood in the urine)
*   Low potassium levels
*   Muscle weakness
*   Weight loss
*   Heart disturbances (with long-term, high-dose oral use)
*   Hepatic (liver) abnormalities


Serious side effects are less common but should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.  If you experience any adverse effects, stop using aloe and seek medical advice.


### How it Works

Aloe's mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to involve several factors.  It contains compounds that may inhibit the production of histamine (a substance involved in inflammation and allergic reactions), thereby reducing inflammation and soothing irritated skin. Aloe also appears to improve blood circulation, promoting wound healing. Some components may also exhibit antibacterial and antifungal properties.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  Aloe is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to aloe or any of its components.  Oral aloe is contraindicated in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children under 12, and elderly patients with suspected intestinal obstruction.

*   **Use with caution:** Aloe should be used cautiously in patients with abdominal discomfort, appendicitis, Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus, hemorrhoids, intestinal obstruction, kidney disease, nausea/vomiting, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), or ulcerative colitis.  Consult your doctor before using aloe if you have any of these conditions.

*   **Drug Interactions:**  Aloe may interact with medications that affect blood sugar levels.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.

*   **Surgery:** Aloe may affect blood sugar levels and could interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery.  Stop taking aloe at least two weeks before any scheduled surgery.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I use aloe on open wounds?** A: While aloe can aid in wound healing, it's best to consult a doctor or healthcare professional before applying it to deep or infected wounds.

*   **Q: Is aloe safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use, especially oral use, may carry risks.  Consult your doctor about appropriate duration and dosage.

*   **Q: How should I store aloe?** A: Store aloe according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically in a cool, dark, and dry place.
