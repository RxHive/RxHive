# Arformoterol

**Generic Name:** Arformoterol tartrate

**Usage:**

Arformoterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) used to prevent wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing caused by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's typically used in combination with other medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, rather than as a standalone treatment for asthma.  It is *not* used for the acute relief of asthma symptoms; for those, a short-acting beta-agonist (like albuterol) is necessary.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Tremor (shaking)
* Muscle cramps
* Dizziness
* Nervousness
* Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)
* Throat irritation

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing) â€“ this is rare but serious.
* Increased blood pressure
* Irregular heartbeat
* Changes in blood glucose levels (especially in people with diabetes)


**How it Works:**

Arformoterol works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in the lungs. This widens the airways, making it easier to breathe. It achieves this by binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, triggering a cascade of events that lead to muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.  Its long-acting nature allows for sustained relief, typically lasting for 12 hours or more.


**FAQs:**

* **Is arformoterol a steroid?** No, arformoterol is a bronchodilator, not a steroid.  It works differently than corticosteroids, which reduce inflammation in the airways.

* **Can I use arformoterol as needed?** No. Arformoterol is a preventative medication, not a rescue medication. It's taken regularly, usually once or twice a day, to prevent symptoms, not to treat them when they occur.

* **Can I use arformoterol during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Discuss this with your doctor. The risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe allergic reactions.

* **Can arformoterol interact with other medications?** Yes, arformoterol can interact with other medications, including other bronchodilators, some heart medications, and certain diuretics. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
