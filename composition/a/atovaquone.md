# Atovaquone
### Generic Name
Atovaquone

### Usage
Atovaquone is an antiprotozoal medication primarily used in the treatment of malaria, specifically in combination with proguanil (as atovaquone-proguanil combination).  While atovaquone alone was once used to treat *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP), this is now less common due to the availability and preference for other treatments.  It's important to note that single-agent atovaquone formulations are largely discontinued in most markets, and its use is predominantly in combination therapy.

### Dosage
Dosage information for atovaquone should always come directly from your doctor or pharmacist, as it varies considerably based on the specific indication (malaria or other parasitic infection), the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the specific atovaquone-containing medication prescribed.  There is no standard dosage for atovaquone alone as its use as a single agent is largely obsolete.  The most common use is in combination with proguanil, and its dosage is determined as part of that combination therapy.  Never attempt to self-medicate or adjust dosages without professional medical guidance.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, rash.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Severe abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine,  difficulty breathing, unusual bleeding or bruising, signs of allergic reaction (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).

If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as serious, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Atovaquone interferes with the ability of certain parasites to produce energy.  Specifically, it inhibits mitochondrial electron transport in these organisms, preventing the synthesis of vital molecules like ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is essential for their survival and replication. By disrupting this crucial energy production pathway, atovaquone effectively stops the growth and spread of the infecting parasite.


### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Atovaquone can interact with certain medications, including those that affect the liver. Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of atovaquone during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a healthcare professional, as its safety in these situations hasn't been fully established.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Individuals with liver or kidney impairment may require adjusted dosages or close monitoring while taking atovaquone.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Atovaquone can cause allergic reactions in some individuals. If you experience signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical help.
