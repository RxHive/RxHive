# Ampicillin + Cloxacillin
### Generic Name
Ampicillin/Cloxacillin Combination

### Usage

Ampicillin/Cloxacillin combination is a powerful antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  It's particularly effective against infections caused by bacteria susceptible to both ampicillin (a penicillin-type antibiotic) and cloxacillin (a penicillinase-resistant penicillin).  

The primary use is in treating mixed infections where both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are suspected. This is common in certain skin infections, respiratory tract infections, and sometimes in cases of sepsis (a life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to infection).  While each antibiotic individually targets a specific range of bacteria, the combination broadens the spectrum of bacterial coverage. This dual action minimizes the risk of treatment failure due to resistance mechanisms in the bacteria.  It is crucial to remember that this combination is only effective against bacterial infections; it won't work against viral or fungal infections.  A doctor's diagnosis is crucial before beginning treatment.

### Dosage

Dosage of Ampicillin/Cloxacillin combinations varies greatly depending on the specific formulation, the severity of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  There isn't a single universally applicable dosage.  **It's critical to follow the prescription exactly as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.**  Oral and IV formulations exist; intravenous administration is usually reserved for severe infections.

* **Oral:**  Dosage instructions will be provided on the prescription label.  This will often involve taking the medication at regular intervals throughout the day.
* **Intravenous (IV):** IV administration requires medical supervision in a hospital or clinic setting. Dosage and frequency will be determined by a healthcare professional and adjusted based on the patient's response and laboratory results.

**Children's dosages:** Pediatric dosages are always determined by a doctor based on the child's weight and the specific infection. Never give a child an adult dosage.

**Specific Dosage Information:**  The exact dosage is determined by a healthcare provider; this information should not be used to self-medicate.  Improper dosage can be ineffective or even harmful.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Itching
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate medical attention)
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Blood disorders
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a potentially serious bowel infection)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Ampicillin and cloxacillin both work by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. Bacteria need a strong cell wall to survive. By interfering with this process, these antibiotics prevent bacteria from multiplying and ultimately lead to their death. Ampicillin is effective against a range of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, while cloxacillin is particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria that produce an enzyme called penicillinase, which normally breaks down penicillin antibiotics.  The combined action significantly enhances their effectiveness against a broader spectrum of bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:** This medication should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Certain medications may interact with this antibiotic.  Inform your doctor of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins) you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only undertaken under strict medical supervision.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary for people with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Superinfection:** Long-term use can increase the risk of superinfection (a new infection caused by different microorganisms).
* **Inflammatory Bowel Disease:** Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease should use this medication with caution.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication early if I feel better?**  A: No, it's crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while on antibiotics. Alcohol can interact with some medications and worsen side effects.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the label. Typically, this means keeping it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Is this medication safe for children?** A: It can be, but only under strict medical supervision and with dosages carefully calculated by a healthcare professional. Never administer adult dosages to children.
