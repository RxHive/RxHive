# Ampicillin + Cloxacillin

**Generic Name:** Ampicillin/Cloxacillin combination (Note:  A fixed-dose combination of ampicillin and cloxacillin is not widely available or common.  This information addresses ampicillin and cloxacillin as individual drugs, and their combined use would require separate prescriptions and careful monitoring by a physician.)


**Usage:**

* **Ampicillin:**  A broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections, including infections of the respiratory tract (pneumonia, bronchitis), urinary tract (cystitis, pyelonephritis), skin and soft tissues (cellulitis, abscesses), and gastrointestinal tract. It's also used for prophylaxis (prevention) of bacterial endocarditis (infection of the heart valves) in certain patients undergoing dental procedures.
* **Cloxacillin:** A penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic primarily used to treat infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, etc.), which are bacteria that produce an enzyme that breaks down penicillin.  This often includes skin infections, wound infections, and bone infections.


**Side Effects:**

Both ampicillin and cloxacillin can cause similar side effects, though the severity and frequency can vary.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion.  Severe cases can lead to colitis (inflammation of the colon).
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a medical emergency).  Penicillin allergies are common.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  Rare but possible, especially with high doses or prolonged use.
* **Hematological effects:**  Anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).
* **Other:**  Headache, dizziness, insomnia.


**How it Works:**

* **Ampicillin:**  Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  It's bactericidal (kills bacteria).
* **Cloxacillin:** Also inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, but is specifically effective against penicillinase-producing bacteria because it's resistant to the enzyme penicillinase.  It's also bactericidal.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take ampicillin and cloxacillin together?**  While it's *possible* a doctor might prescribe both for a specific infection, this is not standard practice. They are usually prescribed separately based on specific infection diagnoses and susceptibility testing.  A doctor must determine the appropriateness of combined use.
* **What if I'm allergic to penicillin?**  Do NOT take ampicillin or cloxacillin if you have a penicillin allergy.  Severe allergic reactions can occur. Inform your doctor about any drug allergies.
* **Should I finish the entire course of antibiotics?** Yes, even if you start feeling better. Stopping early can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
* **What are the drug interactions?**  Numerous drug interactions are possible with both ampicillin and cloxacillin.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Are there any precautions?**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, individuals with kidney or liver problems, or those with a history of allergic reactions should discuss the use of these antibiotics with their doctor before taking them.
