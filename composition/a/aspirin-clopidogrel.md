# Aspirin + Clopidogrel

**Generic Name:** Aspirin + Clopidogrel (combination product; individual components are Acetylsalicylic acid and Clopidogrel bisulfate)

**Usage:**  This combination is typically prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (such as heart attack, stroke, or blood clot formation) in patients who have already experienced a heart attack, stroke, or peripheral artery disease, or who have unstable angina (chest pain). It's also sometimes used after certain types of heart procedures like stenting.  **Crucially, this is a prescription medication and should only be taken under the guidance of a physician.**  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on individual patient needs and risk factors.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage. Common side effects can include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk.  Increased risk of bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, gastrointestinal bleeding (including ulcers), and more serious internal bleeding.
* **Gastrointestinal problems:** Stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea.
* **Rash or itching:** Allergic reactions can occur.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These are rare but can be life-threatening.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Anemia:** Due to blood loss.
* **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP):** A rare but serious blood disorder.


**How it Works:**

* **Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic acid):**  Works by inhibiting platelet aggregation (clumping together). Platelets are essential for blood clotting; by inhibiting their clumping, aspirin reduces the risk of clot formation.  It's an antiplatelet drug.

* **Clopidogrel (Clopidogrel bisulfate):**  Also an antiplatelet drug, but it works through a different mechanism than aspirin. It inhibits the action of ADP, a substance that plays a vital role in platelet activation and aggregation.  This further reduces the likelihood of blood clot formation.

The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel provides a more potent antiplatelet effect than either drug alone, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take aspirin + clopidogrel over-the-counter?** A: No. This is a prescription medication and should only be taken under the direction of a doctor.  Taking it without a prescription is dangerous.
