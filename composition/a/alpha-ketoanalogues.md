# Alpha Ketoanalogues
### Generic Name
Alpha Ketoanalogues

### Usage
Alpha ketoanalogues are primarily used in the prevention and management of damage resulting from impaired or insufficient protein metabolism in individuals with chronic renal insufficiency.  This is typically employed when patients are following a restricted protein diet (generally â‰¤40 g/day for adults), usually those with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 25 mL/min.  The medication helps to mitigate the negative effects of reduced protein intake on the body.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For the prevention and treatment of protein metabolism issues in chronic renal insufficiency, the typical oral dose is 1 tablet per 5 kg of body weight daily, alongside a low-protein diet. If a very low-protein diet (0.3 g protein/kg/day) is used, the dose should be adjusted to 1 tablet per 10 kg of body weight daily. Treatment can continue if the GFR remains below 25 mL/min and dietary protein is limited to 40 g/day or less.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of alpha ketoanalogues in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for hepatic impairment.  However, in patients with renal impairment, the medication may be used as long as the GFR is below 25 mL/min and dietary protein intake is restricted to 40 g/day or less (in adults).

### Side Effects
* Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) is a possible side effect, though the frequency is not clearly defined.

Serious side effects are less common but should be reported to a doctor immediately.  Any unexpected or concerning side effects warrant immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Alpha ketoanalogues work by minimizing the intake of amino-nitrogen while still allowing the intake of essential amino acids.  After absorption, these analogues undergo transamination, a process where they convert into the corresponding essential amino acids by receiving a nitrogen group from non-essential amino acids. This clever mechanism reduces urea formation (a waste product of protein metabolism) and consequently decreases the buildup of uremic toxins.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Alpha ketoanalogues are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substances or excipients, those with hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), and those with disturbed amino acid metabolism.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of hypercalcemia.  Use with caution in patients with hereditary phenylketonuria.  Co-administration with calcium-containing compounds may worsen hypercalcemia.  If hypercalcemia occurs, Vitamin D intake should be reduced.  If hypercalcemia persists, the dose of alpha ketoanalogues and other calcium sources must be reduced.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety and effectiveness of alpha ketoanalogues during pregnancy and breastfeeding have not been established. Use during pregnancy or lactation should be approached with extreme caution and only after careful consideration by a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

**Q: How should I store alpha ketoanalogues?**
A:  Refer to the specific storage instructions provided on the product label. Generally, medications should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I take alpha ketoanalogues with other medications?**
A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting alpha ketoanalogues.  Interactions, particularly with calcium-containing products, can occur.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

**Q: How long will I need to take alpha ketoanalogues?**
A: The duration of treatment depends on individual patient needs and response, as determined by your doctor.

**Q: Are there any specific dietary recommendations while taking alpha ketoanalogues?**
A:  Alpha ketoanalogues are usually used in conjunction with a low-protein diet.  Your doctor or a registered dietitian can provide personalized dietary recommendations.
