# Apremilast
### Generic Name
Apremilast

### Usage
Apremilast is primarily used to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.  It's also indicated for treating oral ulcers associated with Behcet's disease in adults.  While its primary use focuses on these inflammatory conditions, ongoing research may reveal additional therapeutic applications.

### Dosage
**Active Psoriatic Arthritis, Plaque Psoriasis (moderate-to-severe), and Behcet's Disease (Oral):**  The dosage is carefully titrated over several days to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.  It begins with 10mg once daily on day one, increasing gradually to 30mg twice daily (BID) by day six. This is the standard maintenance dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 30 mL/min, the initial dose is lower and the escalation is slower. The maintenance dose is 30mg once daily (OD) instead of BID.  Always follow a physician's specific instructions.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of apremilast in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea

**Other Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache (including tension headaches and migraines)
* Fatigue
* Depression
* Insomnia
* Skin rash (including folliculitis)
* Weight loss
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Back pain
* Joint pain (arthralgia)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While less frequent, serious side effects such as suicidal ideation, severe diarrhea, and certain heart rhythm abnormalities (tachyarrhythmia and atrial fibrillation) can occur.  

**Important Note:**  This list isn't exhaustive. If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor.  PDE4 enzymes break down a molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  By inhibiting PDE4, apremilast increases cAMP levels within cells. This leads to a reduction in the production of various inflammatory substances (like tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-23) while increasing the production of anti-inflammatory substances (like interleukin-10). This overall shift towards less inflammation helps manage the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and Behcet's disease.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Apremilast is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or any of its components.
* **Interactions:**  Certain medications, including strong CYP3A4 inducers, bosentan, and others, may affect apremilast levels in the body. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions.
* **Warnings:**  Apremilast should be used cautiously in patients with a history of depression or suicidal thoughts/behavior, in elderly patients, and in those with renal impairment.  It's also important to monitor for weight loss and gastrointestinal effects.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits of using apremilast with their doctor. The drug is considered Pregnancy Category C.
* **General Precautions:**  Do not crush, chew, or split apremilast tablets.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take apremilast with food?** A: Apremilast can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store apremilast?** A: Store apremilast tablets at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Is apremilast safe for long-term use?** A: The long-term safety profile is still under evaluation, but it's typically prescribed for extended periods to manage chronic conditions. Close monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential.
* **Q: Can I stop taking apremilast suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking apremilast suddenly.  Discontinuation should be done gradually under your doctor's supervision to minimize the risk of potential rebound effects.
