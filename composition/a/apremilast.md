**How it Works:**

Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor.  PDE4 is an enzyme involved in inflammation. By inhibiting PDE4, apremilast reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, thereby lessening inflammation and improving symptoms associated with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It works by modulating the immune response, rather than suppressing it completely, which may contribute to a lower risk of some side effects compared to other therapies.
