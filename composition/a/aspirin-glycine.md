# Aspirin + Glycine
### Generic Name
Aspirin + Glycine

### Usage

Aspirin + Glycine is a combination medication primarily used to reduce pain and fever.  The aspirin component provides analgesic (pain-relieving) and antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects, while glycine acts as a buffering agent. This buffering helps to reduce the irritation of the stomach lining that can be caused by aspirin alone, making it more tolerable for some individuals.  It's important to note that this combination is not typically used for long-term pain management or chronic conditions. Its primary use is for the temporary relief of mild to moderate pain associated with headaches, muscle aches, and menstrual cramps, and to reduce fever.  While sometimes used for other minor aches and pains, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment for any persistent or severe pain.


### Dosage

Dosage of Aspirin + Glycine varies depending on the specific product formulation and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow the directions on the product label or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.

* **Adults (generally over 18 years):**  The typical dose for pain and fever relief is one or two tablets every four to six hours, as needed.  Do not exceed the maximum daily dose specified on the product label.
* **Children:** Aspirin + Glycine is generally not recommended for children and adolescents, particularly those with a viral infection, due to the risk of Reye's syndrome (a rare but serious condition).  Never administer aspirin to a child or teenager without explicit guidance from a physician.  Alternative pain and fever relievers such as acetaminophen are usually preferred.


Oral administration is standard for this medication. It's typically taken with a full glass of water.  There are no injectable forms of Aspirin + Glycine.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of Aspirin + Glycine include:

* Upset stomach
* Nausea
* Heartburn
* Indigestion
* Ringing in the ears (tinnitus - usually at higher doses)

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Stomach ulcers or bleeding
* Liver or kidney problems


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Aspirin works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever.  Glycine's role is primarily to reduce the gastrointestinal irritation that can be caused by aspirin's acidity. By buffering the aspirin, glycine helps to protect the stomach lining. The combination thus provides pain and fever relief while mitigating some of aspirin's potential side effects on the digestive system.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Do not take Aspirin + Glycine if you are allergic to aspirin or any of its components.
* **Bleeding disorders:** Aspirin can increase the risk of bleeding.  Avoid this medication if you have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood-thinning medications.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Aspirin should be avoided during the last trimester of pregnancy and is generally not recommended during breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor before taking this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children and adolescents:**  Never give Aspirin + Glycine to children or adolescents, especially if they have a viral infection, due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.
* **Drug interactions:**  Aspirin can interact with several medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), methotrexate, and some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions if you are taking other medications.
* **Stomach problems:**  If you have a history of stomach ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding, you should use caution and consult your doctor before using Aspirin + Glycine.
