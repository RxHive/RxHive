# Arbekacin
### Generic Name
Arbekacin

### Usage
Arbekacin sulfate is an aminoglycoside antibiotic primarily used to treat infections caused by methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA).  This includes serious infections like pneumonia and sepsis.  It's crucial to understand that arbekacin is a powerful antibiotic reserved for treating serious MRSA infections that haven't responded to other treatments.  It is not typically used for less severe or common bacterial infections.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (MRSA Infections):**  The usual dose is 150-200 mg per day, administered either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). This daily dose may be divided into one or two separate administrations.

**Pediatric Dosage (MRSA Infections, Infants >1 month, Children, Adolescents):**  The usual dose is 4-6 mg/kg/day administered intravenously (IV), given in one or two divided doses. The maximum dose should not exceed 100 mg per dose or 200 mg per day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with reduced kidney function (decreased creatinine clearance, CrCl).  For CrCl >50 mL/min, no adjustment is needed.  For CrCl 20-50 mL/min, an adjusted initial dose followed by a reduced maintenance dose is recommended.  For CrCl <20 mL/min, a significantly lower initial and maintenance dose is required. Specific adjustments depend on the CrCl value and should be determined by a healthcare professional.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** The manufacturer's label doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment. However, caution is advised when using arbekacin in patients with liver problems.

* **Obesity:** For morbidly obese patients, the initial dose may be estimated using a modified calculation incorporating both ideal body weight (IBW) and total body weight (TBW).  Alternatively, an IV dose of 5.5-6 mg/kg may be considered.  A healthcare professional should guide dosing in this population.


### Side Effects

Arbekacin, like other aminoglycosides, can cause various side effects.  These include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hearing loss (ototoxicity), kidney damage (nephrotoxicity),  nerve damage (neurotoxicity),  blood disorders (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia), liver damage (hepatitis), allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives).  
* **Rare but potentially life-threatening:** Seizures, respiratory paralysis.


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those that are serious or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Arbekacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that works by binding to bacterial ribosomes.  Ribosomes are essential for bacterial protein synthesis. By binding to these ribosomes, arbekacin inhibits protein production, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death. Importantly, arbekacin is not easily inactivated by enzymes commonly produced by MRSA, making it an effective treatment option for these resistant bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Arbekacin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to arbekacin, other aminoglycosides (like gentamicin or tobramycin), or any component of the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Arbekacin may interact with other medications, particularly other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs (those damaging to the kidneys or ears).  Concurrent use with loop diuretics, other aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, or certain nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic agents should be carefully monitored by a healthcare professional.  The list of potential interactions is extensive, so inform your doctor about *all* medications you are currently taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of arbekacin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  It should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks, and only under close medical supervision.

* **Renal and Hepatic Function:** Arbekacin is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, patients with impaired renal function are at increased risk of developing nephrotoxicity.  Close monitoring of renal function is essential during arbekacin therapy, and dose adjustments are usually necessary.  Caution is advised in patients with liver problems.

* **Older Adults and Children:** Older adults and children may be more susceptible to the side effects of arbekacin.  Careful monitoring is essential in these populations.  


### FAQs

* **Q: How long do I need to take arbekacin?**  A: The duration of arbekacin treatment varies depending on the severity of the infection and your individual response. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking arbekacin?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking arbekacin, as it may worsen some side effects or interact with the medication. Consult your physician.

* **Q: How should I store arbekacin?** A: Store arbekacin as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Generally, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on how to proceed.

* **Q:  Can arbekacin cause hearing loss?** A: Yes, arbekacin, like other aminoglycosides, can cause hearing loss (ototoxicity), though this is a less frequent side effect.  Regular monitoring of hearing is advised during treatment.
