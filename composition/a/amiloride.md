# Amiloride
### Generic Name
Amiloride

### Usage
Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and congestive heart failure.  Its main role is to prevent or treat hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood) that can occur as a side effect of other diuretics, particularly thiazide diuretics.  Because it conserves potassium, amiloride is often used in combination with thiazide diuretics to leverage the benefits of both while minimizing the risk of potassium depletion.  Amiloride may also be used off-label in certain situations, such as managing edema (swelling) associated with thiazolidinedione use or ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen).


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The dosage of amiloride varies depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's response.  Generally, oral administration is the standard route.

* **Congestive Heart Failure:**  The initial dose is typically 5 mg once daily, which may be increased to 5-10 mg daily in divided doses as needed.  In cases of persistent hypokalemia, the dose might be increased further up to 20 mg daily, but this is usually done under close medical supervision.

* **Hypertension:** Similar to congestive heart failure, the starting dose is typically 5 mg once daily, potentially increasing to 5-10 mg daily in divided doses depending on the patient's blood pressure response and potassium levels.

* **Thiazide-induced hypokalemia:**  The typical dose ranges from 5-10 mg daily, divided into one or two doses, with a maximum of 20 mg daily.

* **Off-Label Uses (Edema, Ascites):** Dosages for these off-label uses are not standardized and will be determined by a physician based on individual needs and response.  Expect higher doses in these cases compared to hypertension and heart failure treatment.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of amiloride in children haven't been fully established.  Use in pediatric patients is generally considered off-label and requires careful monitoring by a pediatrician.  Dosages would be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering factors like age, weight, and the specific condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal and hepatic impairment significantly affect amiloride's metabolism and excretion. Patients with reduced kidney function may require lower doses or have amiloride use contraindicated altogether. Consult a doctor to determine proper usage in such instances.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels - a serious side effect)
* Dehydration
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps
* Weakness
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men)
* Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Impotence
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Allergic reactions

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially hyperkalemia, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Amiloride works by acting directly on the kidneys. It selectively blocks the reabsorption of sodium ions (Na+) in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephrons (the functional units of the kidneys). This inhibition of sodium reabsorption leads to increased excretion of sodium and water in the urine, thereby reducing blood pressure and relieving fluid overload. Importantly, amiloride also conserves potassium, unlike many other diuretics. This potassium-sparing effect is a key benefit and differentiates amiloride from other diuretics.  


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amiloride is contraindicated in patients with anuria (absence of urine production), acute or chronic renal insufficiency, diabetic nephropathy, and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).  It should be used cautiously in patients with reduced kidney or liver function, diabetes, or those at risk for metabolic acidosis.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Amiloride can interact with several other medications, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and potassium-sparing diuretics.  These interactions can increase the risk of hyperkalemia or other side effects.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amiloride is categorized as pregnancy category B, indicating limited human data, but no evidence of risk to the fetus. However, use during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only under a doctor's supervision.  The excretion of amiloride into breast milk is unknown, so discuss breastfeeding risks with your doctor.

* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly individuals may be more sensitive to the effects of amiloride and may require lower doses. Careful monitoring is necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take amiloride with other medications?**  A:  Inform your physician of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Some medications can interact with amiloride, increasing the risk of side effects.

* **Q: How should I store amiloride?** A: Store amiloride at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Follow the specific storage instructions on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Can amiloride cause hyperkalemia?** A: Yes, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) is a potential side effect, especially in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, or those taking other potassium-sparing drugs.  Regular blood tests to monitor potassium levels are essential.

* **Q: Can I stop taking amiloride suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking amiloride suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to rebound effects.
