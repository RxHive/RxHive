# Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide

### Usage
Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines two active ingredients: amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic.  By working together, these components effectively lower blood pressure.  This combination therapy is often prescribed when a single medication isn't sufficient to control blood pressure.  In some cases, it might be used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure, although this is less common than its use in hypertension management.


### Dosage

Dosage for Amlodipine + Hydrochlorothiazide is determined by a healthcare professional and varies depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  There isn't a universally applicable dosage guideline applicable to all.

**Typical Adult Dosage (Oral):**  The most common starting dose is one tablet once daily.  However, the specific strength of the tablet (e.g., 5mg/12.5mg, 5mg/25mg, 10mg/12.5mg, 10mg/25mg amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide) will be prescribed by a physician.  The dose may be adjusted based on blood pressure readings.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  This combination medication is generally not recommended for children and adolescents.  Treatment for hypertension in pediatric patients typically involves different medications and dosage regimens determined by a pediatrician.


**Dosage Forms:** This medication is usually available in oral tablet form.


**Administration Guidelines:** Tablets should be swallowed whole with water, preferably at the same time each day, as prescribed by your doctor.   Do not crush, chew, or break the tablets.

### How it Works

Amlodipine relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood. This reduces blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that increases the amount of urine produced by the body.  By removing excess fluid and sodium, it also contributes to lowering blood pressure. Together, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide provide a synergistic effect in controlling hypertension.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is not suitable for people with certain conditions, such as severe liver or kidney disease, severe low blood pressure, or allergies to amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, or sulfa drugs.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Many drugs can interact with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. It is essential to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication.  Close monitoring is often necessary.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid excessive alcohol consumption as it can interact with this medicine and worsen low blood pressure.
