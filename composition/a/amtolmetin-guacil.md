# Amtolmetin Guacil
### Generic Name
Amtolmetin Guacil

### Usage
Amtolmetin guacil is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used primarily to manage chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  It's also used to help prevent the progression of ankylosing spondylitis.  It's important to note that Amtolmetin guacil is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form (tolmetin) in the body.  This active form works to reduce inflammation and pain.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For acute osteoarticular inflammatory disorders and symptomatic relief, the usual oral dose is 600 mg once daily. This can be increased to 1200 mg per day, divided into two doses, if necessary.  However,  elderly patients (over 65) should generally start with a lower dose (600 mg) due to potential decreased renal function and increased sensitivity to gastrointestinal side effects common with NSAIDs.

**Children:** Amtolmetin guacil is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  In patients with liver or kidney dysfunction, the dose should be carefully adjusted and used with caution under the supervision of a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Flatulence (gas)
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Gastrointestinal bleeding (though less common)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Edema (swelling)
* Visual disturbances
* Hearing loss
* Hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood)


Less common but serious side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

Amtolmetin guacil is a prodrug that converts to tolmetin, a non-acidic NSAID. Tolmetin inhibits the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and swelling. By reducing prostaglandin production, Amtolmetin guacil helps alleviate pain and inflammation. Additionally, the guacil moiety in the drug may offer some gastroprotective effects by stimulating capsaicin receptors and releasing nitric oxide (NO).


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amtolmetin guacil should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Amtolmetin guacil, other NSAIDs, or aspirin. It's also contraindicated in those with active peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or a history of allergic reactions (such as rhinitis, urticaria, asthma) to aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Amtolmetin guacil can interact with several other medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), other NSAIDs, antiplatelet drugs, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and mifepristone (used for medical abortion).  Concurrent use may increase the risk of bleeding or reduce the efficacy of mifepristone.
* **Warnings:** Increased risks of hypertension, peripheral edema, hypernatremia, and gastrointestinal toxicity exist.  Use with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, or perforation, and in those with hepatic or renal impairment.  Use should also be approached cautiously in children over 12 years of age, those concurrently using anticoagulants, hydantoins, salicylates, sulfonamides, and sulfonylureas.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Amtolmetin guacil during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Use with caution, and always consult with a healthcare provider.
