# Afatinib
### Generic Name
Afatinib

### Usage
Afatinib is a targeted therapy primarily used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Its main application is as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring specific mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, as determined by an FDA-approved test.  These mutations make the cancer cells particularly sensitive to afatinib's effects.  Afatinib is also used to treat patients with metastatic squamous cell NSCLC whose disease has progressed despite prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.  Essentially, afatinib targets cancer cells with specific genetic alterations, making it a personalized medicine approach.

### Dosage
The standard oral dose of afatinib for adults is 40 mg once daily.  This dosage remains consistent regardless of whether it's used for first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC or for treating squamous cell NSCLC after platinum-based chemotherapy failure.  Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects occur.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage modifications are necessary based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, no dose adjustment is typically needed.  However, in those with severe impairment, close monitoring is crucial, and dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Renal Impairment:** Patients with a glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 30 mL/min/1.73 m² don't require dose adjustments.  For those with eGFR between 15 and 29 mL/min/1.73 m², the starting dose should be reduced to 30 mg daily.  For eGFR below 15 mL/min/1.73 m², the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific guidance, and careful clinical judgment is required.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reductions or temporary interruptions are frequently necessary to manage side effects.  Specific guidelines are outlined in the detailed prescribing information. 

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of afatinib in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Afatinib can cause various side effects, ranging from common to rare and serious.  It's important to note that not everyone experiences all these side effects, and their severity can vary.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Decreased appetite
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Acneiform rash (acne-like skin eruption)
* Skin rash
* Dry skin
* Nail changes
* Fatigue


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe diarrhea
* Severe vomiting
* Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the lungs)
* Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Cardiovascular toxicity (heart problems)
* GI perforation (hole in the digestive tract)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reaction)

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Afatinib is a type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by selectively binding to and blocking the activity of certain proteins called epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), as well as related receptors HER2 and HER4. These receptors are crucial for the growth and survival of some cancer cells. By inhibiting these receptors, afatinib disrupts the signaling pathways that drive cancer cell growth, ultimately leading to tumor shrinkage and/or slowing down the progression of the cancer.  The effectiveness of afatinib is particularly pronounced in cancers with specific EGFR mutations that make the receptors more readily inhibited by this medicine.

### Precautions
Before starting afatinib, it's essential to inform your healthcare provider about your complete medical history, including any other medications you are taking, allergies, and pre-existing conditions, especially:

* **Heart conditions:** Afatinib can affect the heart and should be used with caution in patients with cardiac risk factors. Regular monitoring of heart function might be necessary.
* **Liver and kidney disease:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on liver and kidney function.
* **Eye conditions:** Patients with a history of keratitis or dry eye syndrome need close monitoring.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Afatinib is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, indicating a risk to the developing fetus.  Women of reproductive age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least two weeks after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least two weeks after the last dose.
* **Drug interactions:**  Afatinib's interaction with other drugs, particularly P-glycoprotein inhibitors and inducers, must be considered by your physician.  Adjustments might be needed to avoid harmful interactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I take afatinib?** A: Afatinib is usually taken orally once a day, at least one hour before or two hours after a meal. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not take a missed dose if it's within 12 hours of your next scheduled dose.  Instead, take the next dose as usual.

* **Q: How should I store afatinib?** A: Store afatinib at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What are the most common side effects?** A: Common side effects include diarrhea, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash. Your healthcare professional can discuss the possible side effects and how to manage them.

* **Q: What if I experience serious side effects?** A: Stop taking afatinib and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or unusual side effects, such as severe diarrhea, severe skin reactions, or breathing difficulties.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking afatinib?** A:  Discuss alcohol consumption with your physician.  Alcohol may exacerbate certain side effects.
