# Afatinib dimaleate
### Generic Name
Afatinib dimaleate

### Usage
Afatinib dimaleate is an oral medication primarily used in the treatment of certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it targets NSCLC that has a particular genetic mutation called an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.  These mutations drive the growth of cancer cells. Afatinib works by blocking the action of EGFR, thus hindering the growth and spread of these cancer cells.  While its primary use is in treating advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC, it may also be used in other EGFR-mutated cancers, though this will depend on specific clinical circumstances and a physician's assessment.  Always consult with an oncologist to determine if afatinib is an appropriate treatment option.


### Dosage
Dosage of afatinib dimaleate varies depending on the patient's condition and tolerance.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage regimen precisely as directed by a healthcare professional.  

* **Adults (Oral):** The typical starting dose is 40 mg once daily. This may be adjusted based on individual response and tolerability.

* **Children:** Afatinib is not typically used in children, and its safety and efficacy in pediatric populations have not been established.

* **IV Administration:** Afatinib is not administered intravenously (IV). It is an oral medication only.

* **Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on side effects.  Severe side effects may necessitate dose reduction, temporary interruption, or discontinuation of treatment.  A healthcare professional will monitor the patient closely and make adjustments as needed.


### Side Effects

Afatinib, like many cancer therapies, can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity from mild to severe.  Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Rash
* Dry skin
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Loss of appetite
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Pneumonia (Interstitial Lung Disease is a serious risk)

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Severe diarrhea
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Liver problems
* Heart problems
* Eye problems (conjunctivitis)
* Blood clots


If you experience any concerning side effects, especially severe or persistent ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Afatinib dimaleate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and division.  EGFR is a specific tyrosine kinase receptor that is frequently overactive or mutated in certain cancers, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.  Afatinib binds to and inhibits the activity of EGFR, thereby blocking the signals that promote cancer cell proliferation and survival.  By preventing the EGFR from functioning properly, afatinib helps to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Afatinib should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to afatinib or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Afatinib can interact with other medications.  It is vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting afatinib treatment. Certain interactions can increase the risk of side effects or reduce afatinib's effectiveness.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Afatinib is contraindicated during pregnancy and should not be used by women who are pregnant or may become pregnant.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for several weeks after treatment is stopped.  Afatinib is also contraindicated during breastfeeding.

* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be required in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.

* **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and other relevant parameters is essential during afatinib treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take afatinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on individual response and the overall disease course. Your oncologist will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How should I store afatinib?** A: Store afatinib at room temperature away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking afatinib?** A: Afatinib can cause fatigue and other side effects that may impair your ability to drive or operate machinery.  Exercise caution and follow your doctor's advice.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of afatinib?** A: The long-term effects of afatinib vary, and ongoing monitoring is necessary.  Consult your oncologist for specific information regarding your situation.
