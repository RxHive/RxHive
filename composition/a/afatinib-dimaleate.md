# Afatinib dimaleate

**Generic Name:** Afatinib dimaleate

**Usage:** Afatinib dimaleate is a type of targeted therapy used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Specifically, it's used in patients whose tumors have a specific genetic mutation called an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.  It may be used as a first-line treatment (initial treatment) in certain cases or as a later-line treatment after other therapies have been tried.  The specific use will depend on the patient's individual circumstances and the type of EGFR mutation present.  It's also used in some cases of metastatic colorectal cancer.

**Side Effects:**  Afatinib dimaleate can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and some severe. Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is often a significant side effect and may require medication to manage.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These side effects can often be managed with anti-nausea medications.
* **Rash:**  Skin rash can range from mild to severe.
* **Dry skin:**  This is a common side effect.
* **Dry eyes:** This can lead to discomfort and potentially vision problems.
* **Stomach pain:** Abdominal discomfort is relatively frequent.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak is common.
* **Nail changes:**  Nails may thicken or become brittle.
* **Pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs):** This is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Diarrhea (severe):** Can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
* **Liver problems:** Elevated liver enzymes are possible.


**This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity of side effects can vary significantly from person to person.  Always report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.**

**How it Works:** Afatinib dimaleate is an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  EGFR is a protein that promotes the growth and division of cells.  In certain cancers, particularly NSCLC with EGFR mutations, this protein is overactive, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Afatinib binds to and blocks the EGFR protein, thereby inhibiting its ability to signal cell growth and ultimately slowing or stopping the cancer's progression.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is afatinib dimaleate administered?**  A: It's typically taken orally once daily as a tablet.
* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?** A:  Afatinib can interact with many other medications. It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Q:  How long is the treatment course?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the patient's response to the medication and the progression of their disease.  Treatment may continue as long as it's beneficial and tolerable.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for instructions on what to do if you miss a dose.  Generally, you shouldn't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of afatinib?** A: Long-term effects are not fully understood and can vary greatly.  Close monitoring by your healthcare provider is important throughout treatment.
* **Q: Is afatinib dimaleate suitable for everyone with lung cancer?** A: No, it's only appropriate for patients with specific EGFR mutations in their lung cancer cells.  Genetic testing is required to determine eligibility.
