# Azelastine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Azelastine (Systemic)

### Usage
Azelastine is a second-generation histamine H1 antagonist primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with upper respiratory allergic reactions like allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and bronchial asthma.  It's also effective in managing symptoms of various dermatologic allergy-related disorders, including urticaria (hives), eczema, dermatitis (including atopic dermatitis), pruritus (itching), and other related skin conditions.  Essentially, it targets the allergic reactions themselves, easing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itching, and skin rashes.


### Dosage
**Adults:** For upper respiratory allergies and dermatologic allergy-related disorders, the oral dosage is typically 1-2 mg twice daily (BID).  In some cases, a higher dose of up to 4 mg BID may be recommended by a healthcare professional.

**Children (over 6 years):**  The dosage for children over 6 years of age is the same as for adults.  Azelastine is contraindicated in children under 6 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for renal (kidney) impairment.  For patients with severe hepatic (liver) impairment, dosage adjustments *may* be necessary; however, specific guidelines are not provided and a doctor should be consulted.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Abnormal gait (stumbling)
* Apathy
* Paralysis (limb)
* Edema (swelling)
* Flushing
* Menstrual irregularities
* Urinary problems (dysuria, hematuria, frequency)
* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Cough
* Dry nose
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST)


If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Azelastine works by inhibiting the release of histamine, a key chemical involved in allergic reactions.  It also inhibits the synthesis and release of leukotrienes, another group of inflammatory mediators.  By acting as an antagonist at both histamine and leukotriene receptor sites, azelastine effectively blocks the allergic cascade, reducing inflammation and alleviating symptoms.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Azelastine is contraindicated in children under 6 years of age.
* **Interactions:** Alcohol may enhance the sedative effects of azelastine. Cimetidine can increase azelastine's serum concentration.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:** Azelastine may cause CNS (central nervous system) depression.  Exercise caution when operating machinery or driving, especially when starting treatment.  Consult a healthcare provider before using azelastine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have liver or kidney problems.
