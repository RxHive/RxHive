# Anethole Trithione
### Generic Name
Anethole Trithione

### Usage
Anethole trithione is primarily used as an adjunctive treatment for hyposialia (dry mouth).  This includes cases of dry mouth caused by medications, radiation therapy (post-radiotherapy hyposialia), and age-related dry mouth (hyposialia of senescence).  It's also used as an adjunctive treatment for lacrimal secretion insufficiency (dry eyes).  It's important to note that it's an *adjunctive* treatment, meaning it works best in conjunction with other treatments or management strategies, not as a standalone cure.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For dry mouth and dry eyes, the usual oral dose is:

* **12.5 mg tablets:** 1-2 tablets three times a day (TID).
* **25 mg tablets:** 1 tablet three times a day (TID).

**Children:**  Anethole trithione is contraindicated in children under 6 years old.  For children aged 6-10 years, the oral dose is 2 tablets per day. For children aged 10-15 years, the oral dose is 3 tablets per day.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Softening of the stool
* Diarrhea
* Darkening of urine
* Allergic reactions


While less frequent, serious side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works

Anethole trithione is believed to increase salivary secretion by boosting the number of muscarinic receptors on salivary acinar cells.  Muscarinic receptors, when stimulated, increase saliva production.  Essentially, the drug helps the salivary glands produce more saliva.  The exact mechanism for its effect on tear production isn't fully elucidated.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Anethole trithione is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to anethole trithione or any formulation component, those with wheat allergies (excluding celiac disease), children under 6 years old, and patients with obstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Avoid use during pregnancy.  Because excretion in breast milk is unknown, breastfeeding should be avoided while taking this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions aren't extensively documented, it's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Other Precautions:** The tablets should be taken half an hour before meals.  Anethole trithione contains lactose and sucrose; therefore, patients with galactose intolerance, galactosemia, Lapp lactase deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption syndrome, fructose intolerance, or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency should avoid this medication.  It also contains an azo coloring agent (yellow-orange S, E110) which may cause allergic reactions.  Darkening of urine is a normal effect of the drug.
