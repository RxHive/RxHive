# Altretamine
### Generic Name
Altretamine

### Usage
Altretamine is an alkylating agent used in the palliative treatment of persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer.  It's specifically indicated for patients whose cancer has not responded well to a first-line treatment that included cisplatin and/or an alkylating agent.  It's important to note that Altretamine is no longer available in the United States.

### Dosage
**Adult Ovarian Cancer (Persistent or Recurrent):** The typical oral dose is 260 mg/m² per day, divided into four separate doses. This is administered for 14 or 21 days within a 28-day cycle.  Dosage adjustments are not specifically detailed for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend using actual body weight for obese patients when calculating dosage based on body surface area, especially for curative intent.  Toxicity management involves temporary dose withholding (14 days or longer) and potential dose reduction to 200 mg/m²/day for certain side effects like low blood counts or progressive neurotoxicity.  Treatment may be discontinued if neurotoxicity doesn't improve even at the lower dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Altretamine in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

*   Peripheral sensory neuropathy (nervous system)
*   Nausea and vomiting (gastrointestinal)
*   Anemia and leukopenia (low white blood cell count) (hematologic)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Fatigue and seizures (nervous system)
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite) (gastrointestinal)
*   Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) (hematologic)
*   Increased levels of liver enzymes (hepatic)
*   Increased levels of BUN and creatinine (renal)
*   Alopecia (hair loss), ataxia (loss of coordination), depression, dizziness, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), mood disorders, neurotoxicity (nerve damage), pruritus (itching), skin rash, and vertigo (dizziness).

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, immediately consult your healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Altretamine is structurally similar to alkylating agents.  After activation within the body, it forms metabolites that create crosslinks in DNA and RNA, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of both. This interference with DNA and RNA disrupts cancer cell growth and replication. Altretamine has shown greater efficacy against platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers compared to platinum-resistant cancers.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Altretamine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, and those with pre-existing severe bone marrow suppression or severe neurologic toxicity.

**Warnings:**  Altretamine can cause bone marrow suppression (low blood cell counts) and neurotoxicity.  Regular monitoring of blood counts and neurological exams are essential.  It should only be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in using antineoplastic agents.

**Interactions:**  Altretamine may interact with other medications, potentially diminishing the effects of some (like BCG or certain vaccines) or enhancing the adverse effects of others (like immunosuppressants or other antineoplastic agents).  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting Altretamine.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Altretamine is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment.  It is unknown if Altretamine is excreted in breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
