# Amlexanox
### Generic Name
Amlexanox

### Usage
Amlexanox is primarily used to treat aphthous ulcers (canker sores) in individuals with healthy immune systems.  These are the small, painful sores that commonly appear inside the mouth.  Currently, it's not approved for other conditions.


### Dosage

**Aphthous Ulcers:**

* **Adults:**
    * **Paste (5%):**  Apply a ribbon of paste approximately 0.5 cm long to each ulcer four times daily (QID), continuing until the ulcer heals.  If significant healing or pain reduction isn't seen within 10 days, reassessment is necessary.
    * **Mucoadhesive patch (2 mg):** Apply one patch to the affected area four times daily for up to 10 days.

* **Children (â‰¥12 years):**
    * **Mucoadhesive patch (2 mg):** Apply one patch to the affected area four times daily for up to 10 days.  Amlexanox is not typically recommended for children under 12 years old without specific consultation with a healthcare professional.

**Important Administration Notes:**

* **Paste:** Wash hands thoroughly immediately after applying the paste.  Ideally, apply the paste after oral hygiene following meals and at bedtime.
* **Patch:** Use clean, dry hands to apply the patch, placing the lighter-colored side against the ulcer. Press gently to ensure adherence. Avoid applying a patch within 80 minutes of bedtime to allow for erosion before sleep.

### How it Works

Amlexanox is an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic immunomodulator.  It works by inhibiting the release of histamine and leukotrienes from mast cells. These substances are involved in the inflammatory response, contributing to the pain and swelling associated with aphthous ulcers. By reducing their release, amlexanox helps to decrease inflammation and promote healing.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amlexanox is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to amlexanox or any components of the formulation.

* **Use with Caution:**  Use caution in children, older adults, and breastfeeding women.  The safety and efficacy in these populations may not be fully established.  Pregnancy category B means animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking.

* **Interactions:** No specific drug interactions are detailed in the provided information; however, always inform your healthcare professional of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to minimize potential interactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Amlexanox to work?**  A: The time it takes to see improvement varies, but you should see some reduction in pain and ulcer size within a few days.  If there's no significant improvement within 10 days, consult your doctor.

* **Q: Can I use Amlexanox for other mouth sores?** A: No. Amlexanox is currently only approved for aphthous ulcers.  Other types of mouth sores require different treatments.
