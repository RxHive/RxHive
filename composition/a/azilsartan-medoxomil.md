# Azilsartan Medoxomil
### Generic Name
Azilsartan Medoxomil

### Usage
Azilsartan medoxomil is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults.  It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure. It can be used alone or in combination with other medications to control hypertension.  While not its primary indication, it may play a role in managing other cardiovascular conditions in conjunction with other therapies, but this should always be under the direction of a physician.


### Dosage
**Adults (Hypertension):**  The typical starting dose is 40 mg once daily.  The dose may be increased to 80 mg once daily, depending on individual response and the doctor's assessment.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of azilsartan medoxomil in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For those with mild to moderate liver problems, no dosage adjustment is usually needed, but close monitoring is essential.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific guidance for those with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary for those with mild to severe kidney problems, including end-stage renal disease. However, careful monitoring is crucial, particularly in moderate to severe cases, as abnormally high serum creatinine levels are more likely.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Diarrhea

**Less Common Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Orthostatic dizziness (dizziness upon standing)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)
* Nausea
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Muscle spasm
* Increased serum creatinine level
* Cough

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Decreased hematocrit (low red blood cell count)
* Decreased hemoglobin level (low red blood cell protein)
* Decreased red blood cell count
* Leukocytosis (high white blood cell count)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

**Important Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Azilsartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, raising blood pressure.  Azilsartan medoxomil blocks angiotensin II from binding to its receptors, preventing the blood vessels from constricting. This leads to relaxation of blood vessels and a reduction in blood pressure.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Allergy to azilsartan medoxomil or any of its ingredients.
* Concomitant use with aliskiren (a medication used to treat high blood pressure) in patients with diabetes and moderate to severe kidney impairment.
* Pregnancy
* Breastfeeding

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Pregnancy:** Azilsartan medoxomil can cause serious harm to a developing fetus.  It should be avoided during pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs, stop taking the medication immediately and inform your doctor.
* **Hyperkalemia:** Azilsartan medoxomil can increase potassium levels in the blood. This is particularly important for those with kidney disease or taking potassium-sparing diuretics. Regular monitoring of potassium levels is recommended.
* **Hypotension:** Azilsartan medoxomil can cause low blood pressure, especially in individuals who are dehydrated or have low salt levels.
* **Renal Impairment:** Careful monitoring of kidney function is crucial, especially in those with pre-existing kidney problems.
* **Aortic or Mitral Stenosis:** Use caution in patients with significant narrowing of the aortic or mitral valves.
* **Renal Artery Stenosis:** Use caution in patients with narrowing of the renal artery.
* **Drug Interactions:** Azilsartan medoxomil can interact with other medications, including ACE inhibitors, other antihypertensives, NSAIDs, potassium supplements, and potassium-sparing diuretics.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs
