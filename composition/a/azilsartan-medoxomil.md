# Azilsartan medoxomil

**Generic Name:** Azilsartan medoxomil

**Usage:**

Azilsartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults.  It may be used alone or in combination with other medications to lower blood pressure.  Some formulations also include a diuretic (water pill) to further enhance blood pressure reduction.  It is *not* used to treat high blood pressure during pregnancy.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Back pain

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) – This is a serious allergic reaction.
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood) – Particularly in individuals with kidney problems.
* Renal impairment (worsening of kidney function)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)

This is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences may vary.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

Azilsartan medoxomil blocks the effects of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, azilsartan medoxomil allows blood vessels to relax and widen, reducing blood pressure.  This mechanism of action is similar to other ARBs.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take azilsartan medoxomil with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur.  Certain medications, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, can increase the risk of hyperkalemia.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking azilsartan medoxomil?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so combining it with azilsartan medoxomil may cause excessive blood pressure drops.  Moderate or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking azilsartan medoxomil suddenly?** A:  No, stopping azilsartan medoxomil suddenly can be harmful.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose before you stop taking it completely.

* **Q: Is azilsartan medoxomil safe during pregnancy?** A: No, azilsartan medoxomil is contraindicated during pregnancy.  It can cause serious harm to the developing fetus.  Alternative blood pressure medications should be used.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) or other severe allergic reactions.
