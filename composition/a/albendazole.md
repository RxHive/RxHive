# Albendazole
### Generic Name
Albendazole

### Usage
Albendazole is an antihelmintic medication, meaning it's used to treat various worm infestations (helminthiases).  Its primary use is in treating cystic hydatid disease, caused by the larval stage of the *Echinococcus granulosus* tapeworm, typically affecting the liver, lungs, and peritoneum.  It's also a key treatment for neurocysticercosis, caused by the larval stage of the *Taenia solium* pork tapeworm, particularly when active lesions are present in the brain.  Beyond these primary uses, albendazole effectively treats various other parasitic infections including:

*   **Intestinal nematodes:**  *Ancylostoma* (hookworm), *Ascaris* (roundworm), *Trichuris* (whipworm), and *Strongyloides* infections.
*   **Other parasitic infections:** Capillariasis, visceral larva migrans, cutaneous larva migrans, and certain types of fluke infections (like *Clonorchis sinensis*).  It's also used in some cases of gnathostomiasis and microsporidiosis.

It's important to note that albendazole treatment for specific infections requires a healthcare professional's guidance, as dosage and duration vary.


### Dosage

Dosage for albendazole is highly dependent on the specific infection being treated, the patient's weight, and age.  The following dosages are guidelines and should not replace consultation with a doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:** Dosage ranges widely from 400mg once daily to 800mg twice daily, for durations from 3 days to several weeks, depending on the infection. Specific examples include:

* **Neurocysticercosis:**  400mg twice daily for 8-30 days (dosage may be adjusted based on weight for those under 60kg).
* **Hydatid disease:** 400mg twice daily for 28 days, followed by a 14-day drug-free period, repeated for 3 cycles.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight, usually 15mg/kg/day divided into two doses, with a maximum daily dose of 800mg. The duration of treatment, like in adults, varies according to the type of parasitic infection. For example, treatment for pinworms might involve a single 400mg dose, repeated after two weeks.

**Administration:** Albendazole is typically administered orally in tablet form. For systemic infections, taking it with a fatty meal improves absorption.  Crushing tablets may be necessary for those with swallowing difficulties.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Headache
*   Abdominal pain
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Increased liver enzyme levels (detected through blood tests)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Increased intracranial pressure
*   Dizziness and vertigo
*   Hair loss (alopecia)
*   Fever
*   Blood disorders (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia)
*   Liver problems (hepatitis, acute hepatic failure)
*   Kidney problems (acute renal failure)
*   Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, rash, urticaria)

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Albendazole's active metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, interferes with the parasitic worm's ability to form microtubules â€“ crucial structures within cells involved in many functions, including nutrient uptake and energy production. This disruption leads to depletion of glycogen (stored energy), impaired glucose uptake, and the accumulation of waste products within the parasite. Ultimately, this causes energy depletion, paralysis, and death of the parasite.



### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Albendazole is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to albendazole, other benzimidazoles, or any formulation components.
*   **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  Albendazole can suppress bone marrow function; therefore, regular blood tests to monitor blood cell counts are usually recommended, particularly during prolonged treatment.
*   **Liver Function:**  Liver function tests (LFTs) are usually monitored before, during, and after treatment due to the potential for liver enzyme elevation or more serious liver damage.
*   **Pregnancy:** Use during the first trimester of pregnancy is generally discouraged,  with careful consideration and weighing risks and benefits in later stages of pregnancy. The medication is excreted in breast milk.
*   **Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are usually recommended for individuals with kidney problems. However, close monitoring is essential.
*   **Neurocysticercosis Treatment:**  In neurocysticercosis, corticosteroids might be given before initiating albendazole to help manage inflammation potentially triggered by the dying parasites.  A thorough ophthalmologic examination is vital before treatment to rule out any eye involvement.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take albendazole with other medications?**

A:  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, herbal supplements, and over-the-counter drugs you are currently taking.  Some interactions are possible.


**Q: How should I store albendazole?**

A: Store albendazole tablets as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.


**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.


**Q:  Is albendazole safe for everyone?**

A:  While generally safe when used as prescribed, albendazole may not be suitable for everyone. Consult a healthcare professional to assess your suitability for albendazole treatment.  Particular caution is needed for pregnant women, individuals with liver or bone marrow problems, and those with known hypersensitivities.


**Q:  How long does it take to see results from albendazole treatment?**

A: The time it takes to see results varies depending on the infection and the individual's response. Some symptoms may improve within days or weeks, but complete parasite clearance may take longer.
