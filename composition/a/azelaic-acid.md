# Azelaic Acid
### Generic Name
Azelaic Acid

### Usage
Azelaic acid is a topical medication primarily used to treat mild to moderate acne vulgaris (acne) and the inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate rosacea.  In acne, it works by reducing the bacteria that contribute to breakouts ( *Propionibacterium acnes*) and helping to prevent the formation of blackheads and whiteheads.  In rosacea, its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to help reduce inflammation and redness.

### Dosage

**Acne Vulgaris (Mild-to-Moderate):**

* **Cream (20%):** Apply a thin layer to affected areas twice daily (morning and evening).  If significant skin irritation occurs, reduce the frequency to once daily. Improvement is typically seen within four weeks.

**Rosacea (Mild-to-Moderate):**

* **Gel (15%):** Apply a thin layer to affected facial areas twice daily (morning and evening). Gently massage it in.
* **Foam (15%):** Apply a thin layer to the entire face (cheeks, chin, forehead, and nose) twice daily (morning and evening) for a continuous 12-week period.  Shake well before use.  Use the smallest amount needed to adequately cover the affected areas.  Re-evaluate treatment if no improvement is seen after 12 weeks.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

* Children 12 years and older can use the same dosage as adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment due to the low systemic absorption of azelaic acid.  However, always consult a healthcare provider before adjusting dosages.

### How it Works

Azelaic acid is a dicarboxylic acid with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. In acne, it directly inhibits the growth of *Propionibacterium acnes*, a bacterium that contributes significantly to acne development. It also helps to normalize keratinization (the process of skin cell growth and shedding), preventing the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads).  In rosacea, the precise mechanism is less clear, but it is thought to reduce inflammation and suppress the production of inflammatory mediators.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Azelaic acid is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to azelaic acid, propylene glycol, or any other component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients with darker complexions may have an increased risk of hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).  Skin irritation is also a possibility.
* **Hypersensitivity Reactions:**  There is a potential for hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, dyspnea, eye or facial swelling, skin reactions, and urticaria.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Azelaic acid is classified as Category B in pregnancy, meaning it has not been shown to cause harm in animal studies, but human studies are limited. Caution should be exercised when using it during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, lips, and mucous membranes. Use only on the skin. Do not use occlusive dressings. Avoid waxing or applying other topical products to the treated area.  For the foam, keep away from fire or flame as it contains flammable propellants.  For the gel formulation, consider avoiding foods and drinks that might trigger flushing or redness.
