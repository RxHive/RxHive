# Acebrophylline + Montelukast

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline + Montelukast

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to prevent and treat symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's particularly helpful for patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by either acebrophylline or montelukast alone.  Acebrophylline relaxes the muscles in the airways, making breathing easier, while montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, inflammatory substances that contribute to asthma and COPD symptoms.  This combination aims to provide a broader approach to managing airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction.  **It's crucial to note that this combination is not FDA-approved in the United States and its availability and usage vary significantly across different countries.**  Prescription and usage should be strictly guided by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person.  Possible side effects associated with acebrophylline include: headache, nervousness, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, heartburn, palpitations, and increased heart rate.  Possible side effects associated with montelukast include: headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, increased liver enzymes, and rarely, serious allergic reactions (including angioedema).  The combined use may increase the likelihood or severity of these side effects.  This is not an exhaustive list, and serious adverse effects are possible.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:** Acebrophylline is a theophylline derivative, a bronchodilator. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Leukotrienes are inflammatory substances that cause bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and airway inflammation.  Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, reducing these inflammatory effects.  The combination provides both bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory effects.
