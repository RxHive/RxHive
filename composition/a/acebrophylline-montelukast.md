# Acebrophylline + Montelukast
### Generic Name
Acebrophylline + Montelukast

### Usage

This combination medication is used to treat asthma.  It combines two active ingredients: acebrophylline and montelukast.  Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator, meaning it relaxes the muscles around the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.  Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier; it blocks the action of leukotrienes, chemicals that contribute to airway inflammation and narrowing in asthma.  By combining these two mechanisms, the medication provides both immediate relief from bronchospasm (difficulty breathing) and long-term control of inflammation, helping to prevent asthma attacks.  While primarily used for asthma, a doctor might prescribe it for other respiratory conditions in specific cases, but this should always be under strict medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on age, weight, and the severity of the asthma.  It's crucial to follow the prescription instructions precisely, as provided by your physician or pharmacist.  There isn't a standardized, universally applicable dosage.  This medication is typically available in oral tablet or syrup form, not as an IV injection.  

**Never adjust the dosage yourself.** Always consult a healthcare professional for any dosage changes or concerns.  They will assess your specific needs and provide the appropriate dose and administration schedule.  Information regarding specific dosage amounts for children and adults cannot be provided here due to the variability in prescriptions;  a healthcare professional will always determine the best dose based on individual patient assessment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Diarrhea
* Sleep disturbances
* Increased thirst
* Feeling tired or weak

Less common but serious side effects warrant immediate medical attention and include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Seizures
* Liver problems (yellowing of skin or eyes, dark urine)
* Changes in mood or behavior
* Suicidal thoughts (especially important to note with montelukast)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical assistance.


### How it Works

Acebrophylline works by relaxing the smooth muscles surrounding the airways in the lungs. This widening of the airways reduces the resistance to airflow and makes breathing easier, relieving symptoms like wheezing and shortness of breath.  

Montelukast blocks leukotrienes, inflammatory chemicals in the body.  Leukotrienes contribute significantly to asthma symptoms by causing airway inflammation, narrowing, and mucus production. By blocking their effects, montelukast reduces airway inflammation and improves lung function.
