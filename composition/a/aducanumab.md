# Aducanumab
### Generic Name
Aducanumab

### Usage
Aducanumab is a medication used to treat Alzheimer's disease.  It's specifically indicated for patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of the disease, reflecting the populations studied in clinical trials.  There is currently no data on its effectiveness or safety when used in earlier or later stages of Alzheimer's.  The primary goal of Aducanumab therapy is to reduce amyloid beta plaques in the brain, a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

### Dosage
Aducanumab is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage is based on actual body weight and follows a specific schedule:

* **Initial Phase:** The initial dose is 1 mg/kg every four weeks for infusions 1 and 2, increasing to 3 mg/kg every four weeks for infusions 3 and 4, and then 6 mg/kg every four weeks for infusions 5 and 6.

* **Maintenance Phase:**  Once the initial phase is complete, the maintenance dose is 10 mg/kg every four weeks, starting with infusion 7.  Infusions should be administered at least 21 days apart.

**Important Considerations:**  A brain MRI should be obtained within one year prior to starting treatment. Further MRIs are required before the 7th infusion (first 10mg/kg dose) and the 12th infusion (sixth 10mg/kg dose).  If ten or more new microhemorrhages or more than two focal areas of superficial siderosis (indicating severe ARIA-H, a type of brain swelling) are observed, treatment may cautiously continue *only* after a clinical evaluation and a follow-up MRI shows stabilization (no increase in size or number of ARIA-H lesions).  The safety and efficacy of Aducanumab have not been established in children.  No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Brain edema (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema or ARIA-E), including sulcal effusion (fluid buildup in the grooves of the brain), particularly in individuals carrying the APOE Îµ4 gene.
* Headaches
* Falls
* Hemosiderosis (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-hemosiderin deposition or ARIA-H; superficial siderosis)
* Microhemorrhages (ARIA-H)


Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Altered mental status
* Confusion
* Delirium
* Disorientation
* Diarrhea

Rare side effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients) include:

* Urticaria (hives)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Development of antibodies against the drug


**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Aducanumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets aggregated forms of amyloid beta, a protein that forms clumps (plaques) in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.  By binding to and removing these amyloid beta plaques, Aducanumab aims to slow the progression of the disease.  The precise mechanism of how this plaque reduction translates to cognitive improvement is still under investigation.

### Precautions
* **Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA):** Aducanumab carries an increased risk of ARIA, including ARIA-E (brain swelling) and ARIA-H (microbleeds).  Regular MRI monitoring is crucial to detect and manage these risks.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and urticaria, can occur.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There is limited data on Aducanumab use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The benefits and risks should be carefully considered by the healthcare provider and patient.
* **Other Medications:**  There is currently no information in the labeling on specific drug interactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Aducanumab?** A:  The timeframe for noticing improvements varies among individuals.  Clinical trials have shown effects over a longer period, so ongoing treatment is necessary.

* **Q: How is Aducanumab administered?** A: It's given intravenously (IV) by infusion over 60 minutes.

* **Q: How is Aducanumab stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with Aducanumab?** A: Long-term studies are ongoing to better understand the long-term effects of Aducanumab.

* **Q: Who should not use Aducanumab?** A: Currently there are no absolute contraindications mentioned in the drug labeling, however, careful monitoring and consideration of the risk-benefit profile are essential before prescribing.
