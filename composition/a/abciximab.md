# Abciximab
### Generic Name
Abciximab

### Usage

Abciximab is a medication used to prevent serious heart problems in patients undergoing a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a type of heart surgery to open blocked arteries.  It's primarily used in two scenarios:

1. **Unstable angina/Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI):**  This is a condition where the heart isn't getting enough blood flow, leading to chest pain.  Abciximab is given to patients with UA/NSTEMI who haven't responded well to other treatments and are scheduled for PCI within 24 hours.  It helps prevent further heart damage during and after the procedure.

2. **Patients undergoing PCI:**  Even in patients without UA/NSTEMI, abciximab can be used during PCI to reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the arteries, which could lead to a heart attack or stroke. This is particularly important in high-risk procedures.

It's important to note that Abciximab is *not* typically used to treat a heart attack that is already happening (ST-elevation myocardial infarction or STEMI) except in specific cases where primary PCI is being performed.  Use in STEMI is considered off-label.


### Dosage

Abciximab is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage varies depending on the patient's condition and the type of procedure.  There's no established pediatric dosage.

**Adults undergoing PCI:** A typical dose is a 0.25 mg/kg bolus given 10-60 minutes before PCI, followed by a 0.125 mcg/kg/min infusion for 12 hours (maximum infusion rate: 10 mcg/min).

**Adults with UA/NSTEMI scheduled for PCI within 24 hours:** A 0.25 mg/kg bolus is given, followed by an 18-24 hour infusion of 10 mcg/min, concluding 1 hour post-PCI.

**Off-label use in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI:**  A 0.25 mg/kg bolus is given at the time of PCI, followed by a 0.125 mcg/kg/min infusion (maximum 10 mcg/min) for up to 12 hours.  Intracoronary administration (directly into the artery) is also sometimes used off-label, typically as a bolus dose of 0.25 mg/kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. While it's not known whether abciximab is dialyzable, it is considered unlikely.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Chest pain
* Nausea
* Minor bleeding
* Major hemorrhage (serious bleeding)
* Back pain
* Antibody development

Less common but serious side effects (occurring in less than 10% but potentially serious) include:

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count, increasing bleeding risk)
* Abdominal pain

Many other less frequent side effects are possible;  a healthcare provider should be consulted if any adverse effects occur.


### How it Works

Abciximab is a type of medication called a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.  Platelets are blood cells that help form blood clots.  The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor is found on the surface of platelets and plays a crucial role in platelet aggregation (clumping together).  Abciximab works by blocking this receptor, preventing platelets from clumping and reducing the risk of blood clot formation. This, in turn, lessens the chance of dangerous blood clots forming in the arteries during and after PCI.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Abciximab should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to abciximab or murine proteins, active internal bleeding, recent significant bleeding, a history of stroke, bleeding disorders, recent major surgery, uncontrolled hypertension,  or a history of vasculitis.  It should also be avoided if the patient is taking oral anticoagulants or dextran.
* **Interactions:** Using abciximab with other antiplatelet drugs, thrombolytics, oral anticoagulants, or IV dextran significantly increases the risk of bleeding.
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), bleeding, and thrombocytopenia exists. Abciximab should be used cautiously in patients with low platelet counts, bleeding disorders, history of gastrointestinal disease, recent thrombolytic therapy, chronic dialysis, age over 65, weighing less than 75 kg, or who are breastfeeding.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Abciximab is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  It's unclear whether it's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Abciximab to work?** A: The effects are relatively rapid, with the bolus dose providing immediate benefits. The infusion further enhances and prolongs the effects.

* **Q: How long will I need to stay in the hospital?** A: This varies depending on individual patient circumstances and physician preference.  Close monitoring is typically required for several hours after infusion.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to report any side effects, particularly severe bleeding or allergic reactions.

* **Q: How is Abciximab stored?** A: Refer to the medication's label for specific storage instructions.

* **Q: Can Abciximab be taken with other medications?** A:  Interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting blood clotting, are a serious concern. A healthcare professional should always be consulted about potential drug interactions.
