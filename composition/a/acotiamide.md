# Acotiamide
### Generic Name
Acotiamide

### Usage
Acotiamide is primarily used to treat the symptoms of postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and functional dyspepsia (FD).  PDS is characterized by discomfort or symptoms in the upper abdomen that occur after eating. Functional dyspepsia is a chronic condition involving upper abdominal discomfort or pain that isn't explained by structural abnormalities or other medical conditions.  Acotiamide helps alleviate these symptoms by improving the function of the stomach and upper digestive tract.


### Dosage
The typical adult dosage for functional dyspepsia is 100 mg three times a day (TID), taken orally with food.  Specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly outlined in manufacturer labeling. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.  There is currently no established dosage for children or other specific populations.  Acotiamide is available in tablet form.


### Side Effects
Common side effects, although the exact frequency isn't precisely known, include headache and diarrhea.  While rare, patients should report any unusual or concerning side effects to their healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Acotiamide acts as a gastroprokinetic agent. It works by enhancing the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating stomach and intestinal motility (movement).  Additionally, it acts as an antagonist at M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in the enteric nervous system (the nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract) and inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine. By influencing these pathways, acotiamide helps to improve the coordination and efficiency of the digestive process, thus reducing symptoms of PDS and FD.


### Precautions
Acotiamide is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to acotiamide or any of its components.  Caution is advised in patients with renal disease. The safety of acotiamide during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established, and it should be used with caution or avoided in these circumstances.
