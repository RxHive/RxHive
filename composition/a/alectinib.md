# Alectinib
### Generic Name
Alectinib

### Usage
Alectinib is a type of medication called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  Its primary use is in treating patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is positive for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).  This means the cancer cells have an abnormality in the ALK gene, making them particularly susceptible to this drug.  The presence of this ALK abnormality must be confirmed through an FDA-approved test before treatment with alectinib is initiated.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual adult dose is 600 mg twice daily (BID) orally.  This is given as two 300 mg capsules.  The medication should be taken with food.  Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of alectinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B), no adjustment is needed.  For severe impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the dose is reduced to 450 mg BID.  Further reductions or discontinuation may be necessary depending on liver enzyme levels.

* **Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¥ 30 mL/min, no adjustment is needed.  For CrCl < 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments.  Careful monitoring is required.

* **Toxicity:** Dose reduction or discontinuation may be required depending on the severity of side effects.  For example, symptomatic bradycardia (slow heart rate) may necessitate a dose reduction or temporary discontinuation, while life-threatening bradycardia may require permanent discontinuation. Similarly, elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels or certain liver enzyme elevations may also lead to dose adjustments or discontinuation.

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Alectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  It works by blocking the activity of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and RET proteins.  In ALK-positive NSCLC, abnormal ALK proteins drive cancer cell growth and survival. By inhibiting ALK, alectinib disrupts these signals, reducing cancer cell proliferation and promoting their death. Alectinib is more effective than some earlier ALK inhibitors against many of the mutations that cause resistance to those other drugs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Alectinib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to alectinib or any component of the formulation.

* **Interactions:**  Alectinib can interact with other medications.  Discuss all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Alectinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the final dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for one week after the final dose.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should be monitored for liver and kidney function, heart rate, and signs of interstitial lung disease or other serious side effects.  Avoid excessive sun exposure and use sunscreen.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take alectinib with food?** A: Yes, it should be taken with food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store alectinib?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking alectinib?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor, as it may interact with the medication or worsen side effects.

* **Q: How long will I need to take alectinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and the progression of your cancer.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
