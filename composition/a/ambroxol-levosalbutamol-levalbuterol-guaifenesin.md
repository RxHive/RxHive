# Ambroxol + Levosalbutamol/Levalbuterol + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Levosalbutamol/Levalbuterol + Guaifenesin

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms of respiratory illnesses, particularly those involving bronchitis and other conditions with both mucus buildup and bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways).  It's often prescribed for coughs with phlegm (productive cough) accompanied by wheezing or shortness of breath.  Each ingredient targets a specific aspect of the illness:

* **Ambroxol:** A mucolytic agent that thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Levosalbutamol/Levalbuterol:** A bronchodilator that relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways, widening them to improve breathing.  This is the levo-isomer of salbutamol (albuterol), often considered to have fewer side effects.
* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that helps to thin and remove mucus from the airways.  It works differently than ambroxol.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects might include:

* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Vomiting:** Throwing up.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Tremors:** Shaking or trembling.
* **Nervousness:** Feeling anxious or jittery.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):**  A faster than normal heartbeat, more common with levosalbutamol/levalbuterol.
* **Muscle cramps:** Painful muscle spasms.

More serious, though less common, side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.  This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult the medication's package insert for a complete list.


**How it Works:** The combination works synergistically to alleviate respiratory symptoms:

* **Ambroxol** breaks down the bonds in mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel.
* **Levosalbutamol/Levalbuterol** relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways, widening them to allow for easier airflow and reducing wheezing.
* **Guaifenesin** assists in the removal of mucus by increasing the volume of respiratory secretions, making it easier to cough them up.
