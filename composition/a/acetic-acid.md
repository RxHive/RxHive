# Acetic acid

**Generic Name:** Acetic Acid

**Usage:**

* **Food Preservation (Vinegar):**  Acetic acid's most common use is as vinegar (a dilute solution). It's a natural preservative, inhibiting the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms, thus extending the shelf life of food.
* **Industrial Uses:**  In industrial settings, acetic acid is used extensively in the production of:
    * **Vinyl acetate monomer (VAM):** Used to make polyvinyl acetate (PVA), a common adhesive.
    * **Cellulose acetate:** Used in photographic film, textiles, and other applications.
    * **Terephthalic acid:** A key component in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), used in plastic bottles.
    * **Solvents and Cleaning Agents:**  It can be found in some cleaning products and solvents due to its ability to dissolve certain substances.
    * **Pharmaceuticals:** Acetic acid is used as an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals.


**Side Effects:**

The side effects of acetic acid depend heavily on concentration and route of exposure.  Dilute solutions like vinegar are generally safe for consumption and topical use, but higher concentrations can be corrosive and harmful.

* **Ingestion (high concentrations):**  Burning sensation in the mouth and throat, esophageal damage, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting.
* **Skin contact (high concentrations):** Burns, blisters, irritation.
* **Eye contact (high concentrations):** Severe burning, potential vision damage.
* **Inhalation (high concentrations):** Irritation of the respiratory tract, coughing, shortness of breath.  
* **Allergic reactions:** In rare cases, allergic reactions, including skin rashes, can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Preservative:**  Acetic acid's acidic nature lowers the pH of its environment, making it inhospitable to many bacteria and microorganisms that thrive in neutral or alkaline conditions.  This prevents spoilage and growth of harmful microbes.
* **Chemical Reactions:** In industrial settings, acetic acid acts as a reactant in various chemical processes, notably esterification (formation of esters), and in the production of other chemicals as mentioned in the usage section.


**FAQs:**

* **Is acetic acid the same as vinegar?**  Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid in water (typically 4-7% acetic acid).  Acetic acid is the active ingredient that provides vinegar's preservative and acidic properties.

* **Is acetic acid dangerous?**  Dilute acetic acid (like vinegar) is generally safe. However, concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and harmful and should be handled with care, wearing appropriate protective gear (gloves, eye protection).

* **What should I do if I accidentally ingest concentrated acetic acid?**  Immediately contact a poison control center or seek emergency medical attention.  Do not induce vomiting.

* **What should I do if I get concentrated acetic acid on my skin or in my eyes?**  Immediately flush the affected area with plenty of water for at least 15-20 minutes. Seek medical attention.

* **What are the uses of glacial acetic acid?**  Glacial acetic acid is a concentrated form (99% or higher) of acetic acid. Its uses are primarily industrial, as it is extremely corrosive and dangerous for household use.
