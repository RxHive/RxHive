# Acamprosate

**Generic Name:** Acamprosate calcium

**Usage:**

Acamprosate is used to help people who are alcohol-dependent stay sober.  It's typically used as part of a comprehensive treatment program that includes counseling and support groups (like Alcoholics Anonymous).  It's not a cure for alcoholism and doesn't reduce cravings in the acute phase of withdrawal.  It's meant to be taken *after* detoxification and as part of long-term maintenance to help prevent relapse.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flatulence (gas)
* Fatigue
* Abdominal pain
* Dry mouth
* Insomnia

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver problems (yellowing of skin or eyes, dark urine, abdominal pain)
* Changes in mental state (confusion, depression, anxiety)
* Seizures


**How it Works:**

The exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but acamprosate is thought to:

* Restore the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain affected by chronic alcohol use.  Specifically, it's believed to influence the activity of glutamate and GABA, two neurotransmitters crucial for brain function and implicated in alcohol dependence. Glutamate's role is thought to be particularly crucial in the craving aspect of addiction. Acamprosate may modulate the effects of glutamate in this regard.
* Reduce the unpleasant symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and reduce the urge to drink alcohol. This is primarily thought to occur by modulating GABA and glutamate imbalances that develop from chronic alcohol abuse.


**FAQs:**

* **Is acamprosate addictive?** No, acamprosate itself is not considered addictive.
* **Can I take acamprosate with other medications?**  You should inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting acamprosate, as interactions are possible.
* **How long do I need to take acamprosate?** The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor and depends on your individual needs and response to the medication.  It's typically a long-term commitment.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking acamprosate?** No.  Drinking alcohol while taking acamprosate defeats the purpose of the medication and can be harmful.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious or concerning side effects.
