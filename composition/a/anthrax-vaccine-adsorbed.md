# Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed
### Generic Name
Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed

### Usage
Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed is a vaccine used to actively immunize against *Bacillus anthracis*, the bacterium that causes anthrax.  It's primarily used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in adults aged 18 to 65 years, meaning it's given to individuals at risk of exposure to anthrax before they encounter the bacteria.  While not its primary use, it can also be part of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in combination with antibiotics following inhalation exposure, especially in pregnant women.

### Dosage

**Adults (18-65 years):**

* **Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** The primary immunization schedule usually involves three injections (0.5 mL each) given intramuscularly (IM, preferred) at day 0, 1 month, and 6 months.  Subcutaneous (SubQ) administration is an alternative, with injections at day 0, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 months. This is only recommended for those at risk of hematoma formation after IM injection.

* **Booster Injections:**  For individuals not at high risk of exposure, boosters are recommended at 6 and 12 months after the primary series, and then every 3 years.  Those at high risk require boosters at 6 and 12 months, and then annually.  Specific booster schedules are crucial for those requiring immediate access to high-risk areas (see Dosage Adjustments below).

**Children:** Anthrax vaccine is not indicated for pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, a transition from PrEP to PEP following exposure involves modified schedules depending on the number of prior PrEP doses received. Refer to the detailed schedule information provided in the original document.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Burning sensation, fatigue, headache
* Endocrine and metabolic: Edema at injection site
* Local: Tenderness, erythema, warmth, nodule, induration, itching at injection site
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Decreased range of motion, myalgia

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hematologic and oncologic: Lymphadenopathy
* Local: Bruising at injection site

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Alopecia, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema, arthralgia, arthropathy, cellulitis, dizziness, erythema multiforme, flu-like symptoms, flushing, hypersensitivity reaction, insomnia, lymphadenopathy, malaise, nausea, pain, paresthesia, pruritus, rhabdomyolysis, skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope, tremor, ulnar nerve neuropathy, urticaria.

**Note:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.


### How it Works

Anthrax vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against *Bacillus anthracis*.  These antibodies provide active immunity, meaning the body is better prepared to fight off an infection should exposure occur. The vaccine contains inactivated (killed) anthrax bacteria, making it safe to use while still triggering an immune response.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like reactions to previous doses of anthrax vaccine or any of its components (aluminum, benzethonium chloride, formaldehyde).

**Warnings:**  Increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, syncope (fainting), and shoulder injuries related to vaccine administration.

**Use with Caution:** In patients with acute illness, a history of anthrax disease, bleeding disorders, or those using anticoagulants; also use with caution in immunocompromised individuals or those taking immunosuppressants.  Pregnant women should consider vaccination for postexposure prophylaxis, if deemed necessary by their physician.   Information on excretion in breast milk is currently unavailable.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the vaccine protect me?** A: The duration of protection varies based on risk factors and booster schedules.  Follow the recommended booster schedule to maintain optimal protection.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Don't restart the series; simply continue with the next scheduled dose.

* **Q: What should I do if I have side effects?** A: Mild side effects are common. Consult your healthcare provider for advice on managing side effects, particularly if they're severe or persistent.

* **Q: Can I get anthrax from the vaccine?** A: No, the vaccine contains inactivated anthrax bacteria and cannot cause anthrax disease.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your healthcare provider.  Typically, vaccines are kept refrigerated.
