# Amifostine
### Generic Name
Amifostine

### Usage
Amifostine is a cytoprotective drug primarily used to reduce the harmful side effects of other cancer treatments.  Its main uses are:

* **Reducing kidney damage from cisplatin:** Cisplatin is a powerful chemotherapy drug effective against various cancers, but it can severely damage the kidneys. Amifostine helps protect the kidneys from this damage, allowing patients to receive higher doses of cisplatin or a longer course of treatment. This is primarily used in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

* **Reducing dry mouth (xerostomia) from radiation therapy:**  Radiation therapy for head and neck cancers can damage the salivary glands, leading to severe dry mouth. Amifostine helps minimize this side effect by protecting the salivary glands from the radiation's damaging effects. This is most effective when a substantial portion of the parotid glands (major salivary glands) are included in the radiation field.

While not officially approved for all uses, Amifostine is sometimes used off-label to potentially protect other organs from radiation damage, such as the rectum during radiation therapy for rectal cancer.  However, this should only be done under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

Amifostine is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosages vary significantly depending on the purpose of use:

**For cisplatin-induced renal toxicity (advanced ovarian cancer):**

* Adults: 910 mg/m² given as a 15-minute IV infusion, starting 30 minutes before cisplatin chemotherapy.  Due to the risk of infusion-related reactions, exceeding a 15-minute infusion time is not recommended.  Antiemetics (such as dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) are typically given alongside this dose to manage nausea and vomiting.  Before administration, ensure adequate hydration.  If the full dose can't be given due to hypotension, the dose may be reduced to 740 mg/m² for subsequent cycles.

**For radiation-induced xerostomia (head and neck cancer):**

* Adults: 200 mg/m² given as a 3-minute IV infusion, starting 15-30 minutes before each fraction of radiation therapy.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of amifostine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Dosage adjustments for toxicity are managed by carefully monitoring vital signs and symptoms.  The physician will adjust the dosage or stop the drug based on individual patient responses.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Nausea and vomiting (ranging from mild to severe)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis)
* Cardiovascular events (such as bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmias)
* Severe cutaneous reactions (skin rashes, blistering)
* Neurological effects (dizziness, drowsiness)
* Respiratory issues (dyspnea, apnea)


**If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**  Early intervention is crucial for managing adverse reactions to Amifostine.


### How it Works

Amifostine is a prodrug, meaning it's inactive until it's converted into its active form within the body.  This conversion happens through an enzyme called alkaline phosphatase, which is found in higher concentrations in healthy tissues compared to tumor cells. The active form of Amifostine acts as a free radical scavenger and protects normal cells from the damaging effects of cisplatin or radiation by:

1. **Binding to and neutralizing toxic metabolites:** The active form of Amifostine binds to reactive metabolites of cisplatin or reactive oxygen species produced by radiation, thereby reducing their damage to healthy cells.
2. **Selective protection:**  Due to the higher concentration of alkaline phosphatase in healthy tissues, the active form of Amifostine preferentially concentrates in these areas, offering greater protection to normal organs and reducing side effects.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Amifostine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to amifostine, aminothiol compounds, or any of its components.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:** Use with caution in patients with existing cardiovascular disease because of the risk of hypotension.  Antihypertensive medication may need adjustment or temporary discontinuation before and after Amifostine administration.
* **Hypocalcemia:**  Amifostine can cause low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia); monitor calcium levels, especially in patients at risk.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amifostine can harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should be evaluated for pregnancy before starting treatment and use effective contraception during treatment.  Lactating women should not breastfeed while taking this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Amifostine can interact with antihypertensive medications, leading to severe hypotension.  Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Amifostine stored?**  A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication label. Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I take Amifostine with other medications?** A:  It is vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements. Some drugs may interact with Amifostine, increasing the risk of side effects.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Amifostine?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the reason for taking the medication and is determined by your physician based on your individual condition and response to treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for instructions if you miss a dose.  Do not try to double up on doses.

* **Q: Is Amifostine addictive?** A:  Amifostine is not addictive.
