# Abiraterone
### Generic Name
Abiraterone

### Usage

Abiraterone acetate is primarily used in combination with prednisone (or prednisolone) to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  It's also used in combination with prednisone or prednisolone in men with metastatic, high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).  The medication works by reducing the production of androgens, hormones that fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells.  In mCRPC, where the cancer continues to grow despite low testosterone levels, abiraterone helps further suppress androgen production, slowing or stopping cancer progression. In mCSPC, it's used to delay the onset of castration resistance, offering patients a longer period of benefit from hormone therapy.


### Dosage

Abiraterone dosage varies depending on the formulation and the patient's condition.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.  

**Adult Dosage for Prostate Cancer (mCRPC and mCSPC):**

* **Film-coated/uncoated tablets (250 mg, 500 mg):**  Typically 1000 mg once daily (OD).  
* **Micronized formulation tablets (125 mg):** Typically 500 mg OD.

In all cases, abiraterone is administered *with* prednisone (typically 5 mg twice daily (BID) for mCRPC or 5 mg once daily for mCSPC) or prednisolone.  Patients should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or have undergone bilateral orchiectomy (surgical removal of the testicles).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of hepatic impairment.  Patients with mild hepatic impairment generally do not require dose adjustments, but moderate impairment may necessitate dose reduction.  Abiraterone is generally not recommended for individuals with severe hepatic impairment.  Renal impairment usually does not require dosage changes. The use of strong CYP3A4 inducers requires careful management and potential dose adjustments.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of abiraterone in children have not been established.

If you experience any concerning side effects, promptly contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Abiraterone acetate works by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 17Î±-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17) enzyme. This enzyme plays a critical role in the production of androgens, the male sex hormones that fuel the growth of prostate cancer cells. By blocking CYP17, abiraterone reduces the body's production of testosterone and other androgens, thereby slowing or stopping the growth of prostate cancer.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Abiraterone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and in females who are or may become pregnant.  Females handling crushed or broken tablets should wear gloves.
* **Drug Interactions:** Abiraterone can interact with numerous other medications, affecting their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Special attention should be given to strong CYP3A4 inducers.
* **Warnings:**  Abiraterone can increase the risk of adrenocortical insufficiency, severe hepatotoxicity, and mineralocorticoid excess (leading to hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention).  Close monitoring of liver function, electrolytes (particularly potassium), and blood pressure is essential.  Patients with diabetes require careful management of blood sugar levels.  The combined use of abiraterone with Radium-223 is not recommended due to increased fracture and mortality risk.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Abiraterone is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to the developing fetus. It should not be used by pregnant women or women who may become pregnant. It's unknown whether abiraterone is excreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store abiraterone?**  A: Store abiraterone at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Follow the specific storage instructions provided on the medication label.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking abiraterone?** A:  Consult your doctor about alcohol consumption while on abiraterone. Alcohol may interact with the medication and potentially worsen side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  How long will I need to take abiraterone?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your individual response to the medication and the progression of your cancer. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while on abiraterone?** A: The instructions about food intake should be followed carefully as they differ between the formulations. For some formulations the administration should be done on empty stomach while for others it can be taken without regard to food.
