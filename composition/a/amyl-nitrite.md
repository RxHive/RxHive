# Amyl Nitrite
### Generic Name
Amyl Nitrite

### Usage
Amyl nitrite is a vasodilator, primarily used for the rapid relief of angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart).  However, due to the availability of newer, more convenient and safer nitrate medications, its use in this context is now quite limited.  Historically, amyl nitrite was also explored for the treatment of cyanide poisoning, but this is no longer a recommended practice.  In some specialized cardiology settings, it may be used to provoke a latent left ventricular outflow tract gradient in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this is an off-label use and more modern diagnostic methods are generally preferred.


### Dosage
**Angina Pectoris (Acute Relief):**  The recommended dose is 0.18-0.3 mL administered via nasal inhalation as needed. Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient response.

**Provocation of Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Gradient (Off-Label Use):** For this specialized diagnostic procedure, 3-4 deep inhalations from a single crushed ampule (over 10-15 seconds) are typically used.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of amyl nitrite in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

*   Headache
*   Facial flushing
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting


Less common but serious side effects include:

*   Syncope (fainting)
*   Shock
*   Methemoglobinemia (a condition where hemoglobin's ability to carry oxygen is reduced)
*   Cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the brain)


If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed as serious, immediate medical attention should be sought.


### How it Works
Amyl nitrite works by relaxing the smooth muscles in blood vessels, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This reduces both preload (the amount of blood returning to the heart) and afterload (the resistance the heart must overcome to pump blood).  The resulting decrease in the heart's workload reduces its oxygen demand, alleviating angina symptoms.  Amyl nitrite also improves coronary collateral circulation, further assisting blood flow to the heart.


### Precautions
Amyl nitrite is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in patients with:

*   Glaucoma
*   Recent head trauma or cerebral hemorrhage
*   Pregnancy


Amyl nitrite should be used with extreme caution in patients with:

*   Severe aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart) â€“ as it can potentially reduce coronary perfusion, leading to ischemia.
*   Pre-existing hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Increased intracranial pressure


Interactions: Amyl nitrite's effects can be intensified by other blood pressure-lowering medications.  Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements being taken.  Additionally, it can interact negatively with medications associated with methemoglobinemia.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is amyl nitrite administered?** A: It is administered via nasal inhalation; the ampule is typically broken and the vapor inhaled.

*   **Q: How long does amyl nitrite last?** A: The effects are relatively short-lived, typically lasting only a few minutes.

*   **Q: Is amyl nitrite safe to use during pregnancy?** A: No, it's contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of significant hypotension and methemoglobinemia, which can harm the fetus.

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication immediately and contact a healthcare professional.

*   **Q: How should amyl nitrite be stored?** A: Store as directed by the healthcare provider or pharmacist, usually in a cool, dark, and dry place away from children and pets.  Ampules should be stored upright.
