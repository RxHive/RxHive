# Albendazole + Pyrantel Pamoate

**Generic Name:** Albendazole + Pyrantel Pamoate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat various intestinal worm infections, specifically targeting a broad spectrum of nematodes (roundworms).  It's often prescribed for infections caused by:

* **Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm):** A common intestinal parasite found worldwide.
* **Trichuris trichiura (whipworm):** Another common intestinal parasite.
* **Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm):** A common intestinal parasite, especially in children.
* **Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale (hookworms):** Hookworms that attach to the intestinal wall.

The specific worms targeted may vary depending on the formulation and the physician's diagnosis.  It is crucial to follow a physician's prescription and not self-medicate.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal disturbances:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
* **Headache:**  Mild to moderate headache.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  In some cases, blood tests may show temporarily elevated liver enzymes.  This usually resolves after treatment ends.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rarely, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.

More serious side effects are rare but include:

* **Severe liver damage:**  This is uncommon but requires immediate medical attention.
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  A reduction in blood cell production, which is also rare.

**How it Works:**

Albendazole and pyrantel pamoate work through different mechanisms to eliminate intestinal worms:

* **Albendazole:** Interferes with the worms' ability to absorb glucose, leading to paralysis and death of the parasites.  It also inhibits the formation of microtubules essential for worm survival.

* **Pyrantel pamoate:**  Causes paralysis of the worms, making them unable to attach to the intestinal wall.  This allows them to be expelled from the body through the stool.
