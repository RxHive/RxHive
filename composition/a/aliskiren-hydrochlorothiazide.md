# Aliskiren + Hydrochlorothiazide
### Generic Name
Aliskiren/Hydrochlorothiazide


### Usage
Aliskiren/Hydrochlorothiazide is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults.  It combines two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic.  By working through different mechanisms, this combination can often achieve better blood pressure control than either drug alone, particularly in patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication.  It's generally prescribed when lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise) and a single medication haven't been successful in lowering blood pressure to a healthy range.


### Dosage
The dosage of Aliskiren/Hydrochlorothiazide is determined by a healthcare professional and will be individualized based on your health status and response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  

* **Oral:** Typical starting doses vary, but a common initial dose might be one tablet daily.  Your doctor may adjust this dose upward or downward depending on your blood pressure readings.  
* **IV Administration:** Aliskiren/Hydrochlorothiazide is not available as an intravenous (IV) formulation.  Aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide are available separately in IV forms, but they are not typically used together in this way.
* **Children:**  This combination medication is not generally recommended for use in children.  Blood pressure management in children typically involves different medications and approaches.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of this medication, and dosage adjustments may be necessary to minimize the risk of side effects.  Kidney function should be closely monitored in this population.


**Important Note:**  Never alter your dosage without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation of this medication can lead to a rebound effect, causing a sudden increase in blood pressure.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Muscle cramps
* Increased urination

Less common but potentially more serious side effects include:

* Swelling of the ankles, feet, or legs
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat)
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Kidney problems


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Aliskiren/Hydrochlorothiazide works through a two-pronged approach to lower blood pressure:

* **Aliskiren:**  This drug inhibits renin, an enzyme crucial in the body's regulation of blood pressure.  By blocking renin, aliskiren reduces the production of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels).  Lowering angiotensin II levels helps relax and widen blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure.

* **Hydrochlorothiazide:**  This is a diuretic (water pill) that increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through urine.  By reducing blood volume, hydrochlorothiazide contributes to lower blood pressure.

The combination of these two mechanisms enhances the blood pressure-lowering effect, offering a more potent and often more effective approach than using either drug individually.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Aliskiren/Hydrochlorothiazide should not be used by individuals with known allergies to aliskiren, hydrochlorothiazide, or any of its components. It's also contraindicated in those with severe kidney problems, severe liver problems, or those with a history of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Numerous drugs can interact with aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide, potentially increasing or decreasing the effectiveness of one or both medications. Examples include potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and lithium. Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is not typically recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.

* **Older Adults & Individuals with Kidney or Liver Disease:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to the increased risk of side effects.  Close monitoring of kidney and liver function is crucial.

* **Electrolyte Imbalances:** This medication can affect electrolyte levels in the body, so regular monitoring is important.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  A: No.  Stopping abruptly can cause a dangerous rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before altering your dosage or stopping treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: Excessive alcohol consumption can interact negatively with this medication, potentially lowering blood pressure excessively. Moderate alcohol intake should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
