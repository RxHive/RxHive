# Aliskiren + Hydrochlorothiazide

**Generic Name:** Aliskiren/Hydrochlorothiazide

**Usage:**  This combination drug is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines two medications that work in different ways to lower blood pressure: aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor) and hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic).  It's typically prescribed when other blood pressure medications haven't been effective enough on their own.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in frequency and severity.  Common side effects include:

* **Aliskiren-related:**  Diarrhea, dizziness, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood), cough, fatigue, nausea, upper respiratory infection.  Rare but serious side effects include angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).
* **Hydrochlorothiazide-related:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, dehydration, headache, muscle cramps, increased urination, low blood potassium (hypokalemia), low blood sodium (hyponatremia), increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia), increased blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides).

Serious side effects, while less common, can include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Kidney problems:**  Altered kidney function, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Significant changes in potassium, sodium, or magnesium levels in the blood.


**How it Works:**

* **Aliskiren:** This medication blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by directly inhibiting renin. Renin is an enzyme crucial in regulating blood pressure. By inhibiting renin, aliskiren reduces the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (narrowing of blood vessels), thus lowering blood pressure.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** This is a diuretic (water pill) that increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys.  By reducing the volume of blood, it lowers blood pressure. The combined action of these two drugs provides a more potent and often more effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Certain combinations can lead to dangerous interactions, especially with potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or lithium.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure and may increase the risk of side effects.  Limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), difficulty breathing, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, or severe dizziness.

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A: It may take several weeks to see the full effect of this medication on your blood pressure.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.
