# Anisotropine
### Generic Name
Anisotropine methylbromide

### Usage
Anisotropine methylbromide is a muscarinic antagonist and antispasmodic.  Historically, it was used as an *adjunct* in the treatment of peptic ulcers, meaning it was used alongside other primary treatments. However, more effective ulcer treatments have largely replaced its use in this context.  While its primary use was as an adjunct in peptic ulcer therapy,  anisotropine methylbromide at lower doses can also increase heart rate and reduce salivary and bronchial secretions, sweating, and pupil dilation.  Higher doses are needed to decrease the motility (movement) of the gastrointestinal (GI) and urinary tracts, and to inhibit gastric acid secretion.  It's important to note that its current use is limited due to the availability of superior treatment options for the conditions it once addressed.

### Dosage
Dosage information for anisotropine methylbromide is not consistently available across all sources and varies depending on the specific formulation and intended use (which is now largely historical).  Therefore, prescribing information should always be sought from a healthcare professional and consulted before taking this medication.  **Do not attempt to self-medicate with anisotropine methylbromide.**  Dosage would be determined based on the patient's specific condition, age, weight, and other relevant factors.  Different forms of the medication (if they ever existed) would require specific administration guidelines.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of anisotropine methylbromide may include:

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Urinary retention
* Tachycardia (increased heart rate)

Less common but more serious side effects are possible, and immediate medical attention should be sought if these occur.  Because this medication is rarely prescribed, a comprehensive list of all possible side effects is difficult to compile without consulting specialized medical literature.

### How it Works
Anisotropine methylbromide works by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in various bodily functions, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and heart. By blocking these receptors, anisotropine methylbromide reduces the activity of smooth muscles and glands controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to decreased motility and secretions. This mechanism contributes to its historical use in reducing the symptoms associated with peptic ulcers and other conditions involving involuntary muscle spasms.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Specific contraindications for anisotropine methylbromide are not readily available in generalized medical literature.  Given the limited current use, any prescription would require a thorough evaluation of the patient's health history by a medical professional to identify any potential contraindications.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Like any medication, anisotropine methylbromide could interact with other drugs, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness or causing adverse effects.  A healthcare professional should be consulted about any potential interactions with other medications the patient may be taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of anisotropine methylbromide during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not established, and it should only be used under strict medical supervision if absolutely necessary.
* **Elderly and Children:**  As with any medication, caution should be exercised when administering anisotropine methylbromide to elderly patients or children due to potential differences in metabolism and sensitivity to its effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is anisotropine methylbromide still commonly prescribed?**
    * **A:** No. Due to the availability of more effective treatments for conditions it was once used for, anisotropine methylbromide is rarely prescribed today.

* **Q:  Where can I get anisotropine methylbromide?**
    * **A:**  Because this drug is rarely prescribed, you should not attempt to obtain it without a prescription from a doctor. If a physician determines it is appropriate for a particular patient in rare circumstances, they would need to determine whether the drug is still available from a specialty pharmacy.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**
    * **A:**  Stop taking the medication and contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.
