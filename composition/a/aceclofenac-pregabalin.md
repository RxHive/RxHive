# Aceclofenac + Pregabalin
### Generic Name
Aceclofenac + Pregabalin

### Usage

Aceclofenac + Pregabalin is a combination medication used primarily to manage moderate to severe neuropathic pain.  This means pain caused by damage or dysfunction of the nerves.  It's often prescribed for conditions like diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage related to diabetes), post-herpetic neuralgia (pain after shingles), and fibromyalgia (widespread musculoskeletal pain).  Aceclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), works to reduce inflammation and pain, while pregabalin, an anticonvulsant, targets nerve pain by affecting the way nerve cells communicate.  The combination aims to provide broader pain relief than either drug alone. While primarily used for neuropathic pain, it may sometimes be considered for other types of chronic pain under strict medical supervision.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is not suitable for all types of pain, and a doctor's prescription is essential.

### Dosage

Dosage will be determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and the severity of your pain.  There is no standard dosage information that can be provided here because it varies greatly.  This medication is available in various formulations (tablets, capsules). The dosage instructions will be printed on your prescription label and explained by your doctor or pharmacist.  

**Important Note:** Never adjust your dosage without consulting your doctor.  Incorrect dosages can lead to adverse effects or ineffective pain management.  This section cannot provide specific dosage guidelines, as these vary considerably and are tailored to the patient's specific condition.

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Aceclofenac works by reducing inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause inflammation and pain. Pregabalin works on the central nervous system by binding to calcium channels in nerve cells, which reduces the release of neurotransmitters that transmit pain signals. The combination of these two mechanisms provides more comprehensive pain relief by addressing both inflammatory and neuropathic pain components.
