# Adalimumab
### Generic Name
Adalimumab

### Usage

Adalimumab is a type of medication called a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker.  It's primarily used to treat several inflammatory conditions, significantly impacting the immune system's response.  Its main uses include:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis:** A chronic autoimmune disease causing joint inflammation and pain. Adalimumab helps reduce inflammation and improve joint function.
* **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis:** A chronic inflammatory condition affecting children's joints.  It works similarly to its effect on adult rheumatoid arthritis.
* **Psoriatic arthritis:**  An inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, a skin condition.  Adalimumab targets both the joint inflammation and skin symptoms.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:** A type of inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine. It reduces spinal inflammation and associated pain and stiffness.
* **Crohn's disease:** A chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting the digestive tract. Adalimumab helps reduce inflammation and improve symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.
* **Plaque psoriasis:** A chronic skin condition causing raised, red, scaly patches on the skin.  It reduces the inflammation and scaling associated with this skin condition.
* **Uveitis:** Inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. Adalimumab helps reduce inflammation in the eye, potentially preserving vision.


Adalimumab also has off-label uses in treating other inflammatory conditions such as hidradenitis suppurativa (a chronic skin condition), pyoderma gangrenosum (a painful skin ulcer), Behçet's syndrome (a rare inflammatory disorder), and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis.  However, it's crucial to discuss these off-label uses with a healthcare provider.  The efficacy and safety in these conditions may not be as thoroughly established as for the approved indications.


### Dosage

Adalimumab is typically administered subcutaneously (under the skin) via injection.  Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and their response to the medication.  The following are examples and should not replace the prescribing information from a healthcare professional:

**Adults:** Dosages range from 40mg every other week to 160mg initially, followed by a maintenance dose.  Specific regimens vary considerably based on the condition; therefore, detailed instructions are imperative from the prescribing physician.

**Children:** Pediatric dosing is significantly more complex and weight and/or body surface area (BSA)-based.  For conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis and Crohn's disease in children, the dosage is determined by the child's weight or BSA and may range from 10mg to 160mg, following a specific schedule determined by a physician.  It’s essential to strictly follow the prescribed schedule and dosage for children.


**Important Note:**  Biosimilars of adalimumab exist (e.g., Adalimumab-adbm, Adalimumab-atto).  However, these are not interchangeable in all cases.  Always consult with the physician about the specific product being used.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Skin rash
* Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, pain)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Increased susceptibility to infections

Less common but potentially serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Heart failure or worsening of existing heart failure
* Blood disorders
* Liver problems
* Neurological problems
* Reactivation of latent tuberculosis or other infections
* Certain types of cancer (lymphoma, etc.)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Adalimumab works by targeting a protein in the body called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).  TNF-α is a key player in inflammation.  By binding to TNF-α, Adalimumab blocks its ability to trigger inflammation, thus reducing the inflammation and associated symptoms in various conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.  This helps to alleviate pain, improve joint mobility, and reduce inflammation in affected organs.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Adalimumab is contraindicated in individuals with severe infections, severe heart failure, and known hypersensitivity to adalimumab or its components.
* **Interactions:** Adalimumab may interact with other medications, especially immunosuppressants.  Consult your physician about any other medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of adalimumab during pregnancy and breastfeeding needs to be carefully considered and discussed with your healthcare provider due to potential risks.
* **Infections:** Adalimumab increases the risk of infections.  Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of infection.  Testing for latent tuberculosis before and during treatment is often necessary.
* **Malignancies:** There's a slightly increased risk of certain cancers associated with adalimumab, especially lymphoma.  Regular monitoring is essential, particularly for individuals with pre-existing risk factors.

### FAQs

* **How long does it take to work?**  The onset of effects varies depending on the condition being treated.  It may take several weeks or even months to see a significant improvement.

* **How is it stored?**  Adalimumab should be stored in a refrigerator, unless otherwise specified on the label.  It should not be frozen.

* **Can I stop taking it suddenly?**  No, do not stop taking Adalimumab without consulting your healthcare provider.  Abrupt discontinuation can lead to a return of symptoms and potentially serious consequences.

* **What if I miss a dose?**  Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on missed doses.  The instructions will vary based on your specific treatment plan.

* **Are there any alternatives?** Yes, several other medications can treat the same conditions. Discuss these with your physician to determine the most suitable option for your situation.
