* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  Reduces signs and symptoms, slows joint damage, and improves physical function.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, adalimumab can cause side effects.  Some are common, while others are rare but serious.  These can include:

* **Common (affecting more than 1 in 10 people):** Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), headache, nausea, upper respiratory tract infections, fatigue.
* **Less Common:**  Infections (including serious ones like tuberculosis), allergic reactions,  low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), liver problems, heart failure,  nervous system problems (including numbness and tingling),  kidney problems.
* **Serious (though rare):**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), lymphoma and other cancers, demyelinating diseases (like multiple sclerosis), lupus-like syndrome, opportunistic infections (due to weakened immune system), reactivation of hepatitis B.


**How it Works:** Adalimumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). TNF-α is a key player in the inflammation process in many autoimmune diseases. By binding to and neutralizing TNF-α, adalimumab reduces inflammation and helps alleviate symptoms of the targeted condition.
