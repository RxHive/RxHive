**How it Works:** Atezolizumab works by blocking the PD-L1 protein found on some cancer cells.  PD-L1 helps cancer cells evade detection and destruction by the body's immune system. By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab allows the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer cells more effectively.

**FAQs:**

* **Is atezolizumab a chemotherapy drug?** No, it's an immunotherapy drug, not a chemotherapy drug.  It works by boosting the body's own immune system to fight cancer, rather than directly killing cancer cells through toxic chemicals.
