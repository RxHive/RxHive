# Atazanavir
### Generic Name
Atazanavir

### Usage
Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor primarily used to treat HIV-1 infection.  It's crucial to understand that atazanavir is *always* used in combination with other antiretroviral medications, never as a standalone treatment. This combination approach helps to suppress the HIV virus, improving the patient's immune system and overall health.  While its primary use is in HIV-1 treatment, there aren't any notable secondary uses outside of this context.  The drug is approved for use in patients aged 3 months and older, weighing at least 5 kg.  Use in younger infants is not recommended due to the risk of kernicterus.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the patient's age, weight, treatment experience (antiretroviral-naive vs. experienced), and other medications they're taking.  Consult the prescribing information or a healthcare professional for precise instructions.  Here's a summary of general dosage guidelines, but it is not exhaustive and should not be used in place of professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Antiretroviral-naive patients:**  Typically 300 mg once daily with either 100 mg ritonavir or 150 mg cobicistat once daily.  A 400 mg once daily dose of atazanavir alone may be used in patients who cannot tolerate ritonavir.
* **Antiretroviral-experienced patients:** Usually 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir or 150 mg cobicistat once daily.  Unboosted atazanavir is not recommended in this group.
* **Pregnant patients:**  Typically 300 mg once daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. Dosage adjustments may be needed in the second and third trimesters, depending on other medications used (particularly tenofovir and H2-receptor antagonists). Consult a doctor for specific guidance.

**Pediatric Patients:**

Dosage for children depends heavily on weight and age, and whether a boosted or unboosted regimen is appropriate.  Formulations include capsules and oral powder; these are *not* interchangeable. Boosted regimens (with ritonavir) are generally preferred.  The precise dose of atazanavir and ritonavir will vary based on the child's weight, ranging from 150 mg atazanavir/80 mg ritonavir to 300 mg atazanavir/100 mg ritonavir per day.  Consult the prescribing information or a healthcare professional for specific instructions. Unboosted regimens are generally not recommended except under specific circumstances for older children and adolescents.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are often needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment. These adjustments depend on the severity of impairment and whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used for boosting.  Always follow the advice of a healthcare professional for dose modifications in these circumstances.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These occur in more than 10% of patients:

* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Increased serum cholesterol and bilirubin levels
* Jaundice
* Cough
* Fever


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** These are less frequent but can be severe:

* Cardiovascular issues (e.g., peripheral edema, heart block)
* Nervous system effects (e.g., headache, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, depression, dizziness)
* Liver damage (increased ALT, AST levels)
* Pancreatitis
* Allergic reactions (including DRESS syndrome and Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
* Kidney problems (nephrolithiasis)
* Changes in blood cell counts


If any adverse effects occur, particularly serious ones, seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works

Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor.  HIV needs a protease enzyme to produce infectious viral particles. Atazanavir works by binding to this enzyme, blocking its activity. This prevents the virus from replicating effectively, allowing the immune system to regain strength.  Boosting with ritonavir or cobicistat improves the effectiveness and duration of action by preventing the liver from breaking down atazanavir too quickly.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Atazanavir should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to atazanavir or any of its ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:** Atazanavir interacts with numerous other medications, including antifungal agents, enzyme inducers, statins, sedatives, and many others. This can significantly impact the effectiveness of Atazanavir or the other medications, and potentially lead to serious side effects.  Always inform your doctor of all medications (prescription and over-the-counter) and supplements you are taking.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Atazanavir dosage needs careful adjustment for those with liver or kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Atazanavir is used in pregnancy, generally with a ritonavir booster, but careful monitoring is required.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Atazanavir due to the risk of transmission of the virus.
* **Other precautions:**  Atazanavir can affect blood sugar levels and may increase the risk of kidney stones.  Regular monitoring of blood sugar and kidney function may be necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take atazanavir with other medications?** A:  No, you should never start or stop taking any medication without first talking to your doctor. Atazanavir interacts with many other drugs, and incorrect combinations can have severe consequences.
* **Q: How should I store atazanavir?** A: Store atazanavir as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and light.
* **Q: How long does it take for atazanavir to work?** A:  It takes time to see significant improvements in viral load.  Regular monitoring of viral load and CD4 count is crucial to assess treatment effectiveness.
* **Q: Is atazanavir safe?** A:  Like all medications, atazanavir carries risks of side effects.  The benefits of HIV suppression usually outweigh these risks, but close monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.  Talk to your healthcare provider about a missed dose strategy.
