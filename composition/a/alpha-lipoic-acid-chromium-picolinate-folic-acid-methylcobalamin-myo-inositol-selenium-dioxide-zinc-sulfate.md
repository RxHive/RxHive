# Alpha Lipoic Acid + Chromium Picolinate + Folic Acid + Methylcobalamin + Myo-Inositol + Selenium dioxide + Zinc Sulfate

**Generic Name:** Alpha Lipoic Acid + Chromium Picolinate + Folic Acid + Methylcobalamin + Myo-Inositol + Selenium Dioxide + Zinc Sulfate (This is a combination product, not a single generic name)

**Usage:** This combination supplement is often marketed to support metabolic health, blood sugar control, and nerve function.  The individual components have various roles:

* **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA):** An antioxidant that may help with diabetic neuropathy and improve insulin sensitivity.
* **Chromium Picolinate:** May help improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control.
* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Essential for DNA synthesis, cell growth, and red blood cell formation. Crucial during pregnancy.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Important for nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **Myo-Inositol:** A type of sugar alcohol that may improve insulin sensitivity and is sometimes used to treat PCOS.
* **Selenium Dioxide (Selenium):** An antioxidant mineral involved in thyroid hormone metabolism and immune function.
* **Zinc Sulfate (Zinc):** An essential mineral involved in numerous bodily functions, including immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis.

The combination aims to synergistically enhance these individual effects. However,  scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of this specific combination for any particular condition is limited.  More research is needed.  Consult a doctor before using this product, especially if you have underlying health conditions.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects vary depending on the individual and dosage, but can include:

* **ALA:** Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea), skin rash.
* **Chromium Picolinate:**  Gastrointestinal upset, headache. Some concerns exist regarding potential toxicity with high doses, though generally considered safe at recommended levels.
* **Folic Acid:** Generally well-tolerated. High doses can mask B12 deficiency.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Generally well-tolerated.  Rarely, can cause nausea, diarrhea, or itching.
* **Myo-Inositol:** Generally well-tolerated. Gastrointestinal upset may occur.
* **Selenium Dioxide:** In high doses, can cause hair loss, nail changes, fatigue, and garlic breath.
* **Zinc Sulfate:** In high doses, can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and copper deficiency.


**How it Works:**  Each component acts independently, but together they are theoretically designed to:

* **Improve Insulin Sensitivity:** ALA, chromium, and myo-inositol work synergistically to potentially improve how the body uses insulin.
* **Support Nerve Function:** Methylcobalamin and ALA may help maintain healthy nerve function.
* **Boost Antioxidant Defense:** ALA and selenium act as antioxidants, protecting cells from damage.
* **Support Metabolic Processes:**  Folic acid, B12, and zinc are crucial co-factors in many metabolic pathways.


**FAQs:**

* **Is this supplement safe?**  Generally, the individual components are considered safe when taken at recommended dosages.  However, interactions with medications are possible, and high doses can lead to side effects.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist before use.
