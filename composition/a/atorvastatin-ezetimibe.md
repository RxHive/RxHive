# Atorvastatin + Ezetimibe

**Generic Name:** Atorvastatin/Ezetimibe

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to lower levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and fats (triglycerides) in the blood, and to raise levels of "good" cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL).  It's prescribed for adults with high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) who haven't been able to reach their cholesterol goals with atorvastatin alone. It's often used in people with a high risk of heart disease or who have already had a heart attack or stroke.  The doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, atorvastatin/ezetimibe can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Musculoskeletal:** Muscle aches, pain, and weakness (myalgia), rarely including rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown â€“ seek immediate medical attention if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, especially with fever or dark urine).
* **Gastrointestinal:**  Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.
* **Liver:**  Elevated liver enzymes (rarely leading to liver damage).  Regular liver function tests may be recommended.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness, rash, allergic reactions (rare but serious).

**Rare but serious side effects:**  These require immediate medical attention:

* **Rhabdomyolysis:**  Severe muscle breakdown.
* **Liver damage:**  Signs may include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms can range from rash to difficulty breathing or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.


**How it Works:** Atorvastatin works by blocking an enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) in the liver that's involved in cholesterol production.  This leads to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. Ezetimibe works by blocking the absorption of cholesterol from the intestines into the bloodstream.  The combination of these two medications provides a greater cholesterol-lowering effect than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of liver damage, so it's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take two doses at once.
