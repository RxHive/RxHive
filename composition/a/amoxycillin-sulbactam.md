# Amoxycillin + Sulbactam
### Generic Name
Amoxycillin + Sulbactam

### Usage
Amoxycillin/sulbactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  Its primary use is for infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin alone.  Sulbactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, prevents certain bacteria from breaking down amoxicillin, thus enhancing its effectiveness.  This combination is commonly prescribed for infections affecting the:

* **Respiratory tract:**  Pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, and other lung infections.
* **Skin and soft tissues:**  Cellulitis, abscesses, and wound infections.
* **Genitourinary tract:**  Urinary tract infections (UTIs), including pyelonephritis (kidney infection).
* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen, often following surgery or injury.
* **Septicemia:** A severe bloodstream infection.


While not always a first-line treatment, it may be used in other infections based on the severity and causative bacteria identified.  A doctor will determine the appropriate use based on individual patient needs and test results.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the individual's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific form of the medication (oral tablets/capsules or intravenous injection).  **It is crucial to follow the dosage prescribed by your doctor precisely.**  Do not alter the dosage without consulting a physician.

**Adults (Oral):** Typical doses range from 500mg to 1000mg of amoxicillin/sulbactam every 8 or 12 hours, depending on the severity of infection.

**Adults (IV):** IV administration involves higher doses, often 1.5g to 3g every 6-8 hours, administered by a healthcare professional.

**Children (Oral):** Dosage for children is calculated based on weight and is generally determined by a physician based on the child's age and condition.  Liquid formulations are commonly available for children.

**Children (IV):** IV administration in children is also determined by a physician based on weight and the severity of the infection.

**Specific dosage instructions are crucial and should be obtained directly from the prescribing physician or pharmacist.**  The medication should be taken with a full glass of water.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of Amoxycillin/sulbactam can include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Itching
* Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)


Less common but serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin rash to severe anaphylaxis)
* Liver inflammation (hepatitis)
* Seizures (particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney or liver problems)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a serious bowel infection)


**If you experience any of these side effects, particularly severe ones, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Amoxycillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that works by preventing bacteria from building their cell walls.  Without a proper cell wall, the bacteria cannot survive.  Sulbactam acts as a β-lactamase inhibitor.  Many bacteria produce β-lactamases, enzymes that break down penicillin-type antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. Sulbactam inhibits these enzymes, allowing amoxicillin to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor if you have any allergies to penicillin, cephalosporins, or other antibiotics.  Severe allergic reactions can be life-threatening.
* **Kidney Problems:**  Amoxycillin/sulbactam is excreted by the kidneys.  Those with impaired kidney function may require dosage adjustments or close monitoring.
* **Liver Problems:**  Use caution in patients with liver disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe, the benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated by a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication may interact with certain other drugs, including anticoagulants (blood thinners). Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Clostridium difficile:**  Prolonged use of antibiotics like Amoxycillin/sulbactam can increase the risk of Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), which can cause severe diarrhea.
* **Superinfection:**  The medication can cause an overgrowth of other microorganisms, leading to a new infection.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Amoxycillin/sulbactam with food?** A:  While food may not significantly affect absorption, taking it with food might help reduce nausea.  Follow your doctor's recommendations.

* **Q: How long should I take this medication?** A:  The duration of treatment varies depending on the infection.  Complete the prescribed course of antibiotics even if you feel better to prevent recurrence.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Amoxycillin/sulbactam?** A:  Store the medication as instructed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol is generally not recommended while taking this medication as it can potentially exacerbate some side effects like nausea. Discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist.
