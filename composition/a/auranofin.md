# Auranofin
### Generic Name
Auranofin

### Usage
Auranofin is a medication containing gold used primarily to treat active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who haven't responded well to or can't tolerate other treatments.  It's considered a second-line therapy, meaning it's used after other options have been tried.  While not officially approved for this use, it's sometimes used off-label in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  The effectiveness and safety in children require careful monitoring by a physician.

### Dosage

**Adults (Rheumatoid Arthritis):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is typically 6 mg per day, taken in one or two divided doses.  After six months, the doctor may increase the dose to 9 mg per day in three divided doses.  If there's no improvement after three months, the treatment is usually stopped.

**Children (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis - Off-Label):**

* **Oral:** The starting dose is usually 0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, divided into multiple doses.  The maintenance dose might be increased to 0.15 mg/kg/day or divided into two doses.  The maximum daily dose is 0.2 mg/kg/day or 9 mg/day, whichever is lower.  *This is off-label use and requires close medical supervision.*

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for liver or kidney problems. However, some clinical guidance suggests reducing the dose by 50% if kidney function is moderately impaired (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) and avoiding auranofin if kidney function is severely impaired (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min).  Always consult a physician for dosage adjustments based on individual patient needs and lab results.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Skin rash and itching (pruritus)
* Diarrhea, loose stools, abdominal pain, and mouth sores (stomatitis)

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Hives (urticaria)
* Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite (anorexia), indigestion (dyspepsia), gas (flatulence), constipation, altered taste (dysgeusia), and inflammation of the tongue (glossitis)
* Protein in the urine (proteinuria) and blood in the urine (hematuria)
* Anemia, eosinophilia (increased eosinophils), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Conjunctivitis (eye inflammation)


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Severe decrease in white blood cells (agranulocytosis), aplastic anemia, angioedema, gold-induced bronchitis, corneal deposits, difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), severe skin reactions (exfoliative dermatitis), fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, gum inflammation (gingivitis), liver damage (hepatotoxicity), lung inflammation (interstitial pneumonitis), jaundice, metallic taste, black, tarry stools (melena), severe decrease in neutrophils (neutropenia), pancytopenia (decrease in all blood cells), peripheral neuropathy, pure red cell aplasia, and inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative enterocolitis).


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Auranofin's precise mechanism of action isn't fully understood.  It involves gold uptake by macrophages (immune cells), which leads to the inhibition of phagocytosis (engulfing and destroying of foreign particles), stabilization of lysosomal membranes (protective structures within cells), and decreases in rheumatoid factor levels and alterations in immunoglobulins (antibodies).  Additionally, it's believed to decrease complement activation (part of the immune response), inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (inflammation mediators), and reduce lysosomal enzyme activity.  These effects collectively contribute to reducing inflammation and symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Auranofin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to auranofin or related gold compounds, history of severe gold toxicity (including anaphylaxis), bone marrow aplasia, severe hematologic disorders, exfoliative dermatitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis.

**Warnings:**  Auranofin can cause gold toxicity, manifested by decreases in hemoglobin, white blood cells, granulocytes, and platelets; proteinuria, hematuria, pruritus, rash, stomatitis, or persistent diarrhea.  It should be used cautiously in patients with skin rashes, inflammatory bowel disease, liver or kidney problems, or bone marrow depression. Close monitoring is crucial.  The drug should be reserved for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who haven't responded to other treatments.  Physicians prescribing auranofin should be experienced in gold therapy and monitor patients closely.


**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Auranofin is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to the fetus are unknown. It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while using auranofin.

**Drug Interactions:**  Auranofin may interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take auranofin with food?** A:  Auranofin can be taken with or without food. However, if it causes gastrointestinal upset, taking it with food may help.

**Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Significant improvement might not be noticeable for three months or longer.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any new or worsening symptoms, especially those listed above, to your doctor immediately.  Treatment may need to be adjusted or stopped.

**Q: How should I store auranofin?** A: Store auranofin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

**Q: Is auranofin right for me?** A:  Only your doctor can determine if auranofin is appropriate for your specific condition and health status.  They will consider your medical history and other factors before making a recommendation.
