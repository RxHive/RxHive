# Amphetamine
### Generic Name
Amphetamine

### Usage

Amphetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.  It's also been used in the past for exogenous obesity (obesity not caused by underlying medical conditions), though this use is less common now due to concerns about its potential for abuse and side effects.  The medication works by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, neurotransmitters that affect mood, attention, and energy levels.  In ADHD, this helps improve focus and reduce hyperactivity. In narcolepsy, it combats excessive daytime sleepiness.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and individual patient response. It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.

* **ADHD (Oral, extended-release formulations):** Starting doses are typically low (e.g., 12.5 mg once daily) and are gradually increased in small increments (2.5-10 mg) over several days until the optimal effect is reached. The maximum daily dose is usually 20 mg.  Different extended-release formulations (tablets, suspensions) exist, and milligram-to-milligram comparisons between brands are not accurate due to varying base composition and pharmacokinetic profiles.  Switching from another amphetamine product requires careful titration under medical supervision.

* **Exogenous Obesity (Oral, immediate-release tablets):** Up to 30 mg per day may be prescribed, divided into smaller doses (5-10 mg per dose).

* **Narcolepsy (Oral, immediate-release tablets):**  Treatment typically starts with 10 mg once daily, gradually increasing by 10 mg increments weekly until the desired level of wakefulness is achieved. The usual range is 5-60 mg/day in divided doses.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage for children is significantly lower and strictly determined by age, weight, and the specific condition.  Similar to adult dosing, it involves careful titration under strict medical supervision.  Immediate-release and extended-release formulations are available, each with specific starting doses and titration schedules.  Always follow a physician's precise directions.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If any concerning side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Amphetamine is a stimulant that affects the release and reuptake of neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.  By increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters, amphetamine enhances alertness, focus, and energy levels.  Specifically, it works by:

1. **Increasing the release of dopamine and norepinephrine:**  Amphetamine stimulates the release of these neurotransmitters from their storage vesicles in nerve cells.

2. **Blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine:**  It prevents the nerve cells from reabsorbing these neurotransmitters, prolonging their effects in the synaptic cleft (the space between nerve cells).


This increased activity of dopamine and norepinephrine leads to the stimulant effects observed in ADHD and narcolepsy treatment.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Amphetamine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to amphetamine or any of its components, those currently using or having recently used monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and in certain cardiovascular conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:** Amphetamine can interact with numerous other medications, including MAOIs, antidepressants, and certain antihypertensives. Consult a doctor about all medications before taking amphetamine.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Amphetamine is categorized as a Pregnancy Category C drug.  Use during pregnancy is generally avoided unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Amphetamine is excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
* **Geriatric and Pediatric Populations:**  Special considerations apply to these populations, and dosing must be carefully adjusted based on age, weight, and other factors.
* **Abuse Potential:** Amphetamine has a high potential for abuse and dependence. Close monitoring is crucial to minimize the risk of misuse.



### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for amphetamine to work?**  A: The onset of effects varies depending on the formulation (immediate-release vs. extended-release), but effects are usually noticeable within 30-60 minutes for immediate-release forms and more gradually for extended-release.

* **Q: Can I stop taking amphetamine suddenly?** A: No. Abrupt discontinuation, especially after prolonged use or high doses, can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Always follow a doctor's instructions when tapering off amphetamine.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking amphetamine?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking amphetamine, as the combination can potentially increase the risk of certain side effects, including cardiovascular problems.

* **Q: How should I store amphetamine?** A: Store amphetamine at room temperature, away from light and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children and pets.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose. Never double up on doses.
