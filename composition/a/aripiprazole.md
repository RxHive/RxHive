# Aripiprazole
### Generic Name
Aripiprazole

### Usage

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder.  Its uses encompass various aspects of these conditions:

* **Schizophrenia:** Aripiprazole effectively manages the positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking) and negative symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal, lack of motivation) of schizophrenia. It also helps control agitation associated with the illness.

* **Bipolar I Disorder:** Aripiprazole is used for both acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes (periods of intense energy, euphoria, or irritability) and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.  It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other mood stabilizers like lithium or valproate.

* **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):**  Aripiprazole is sometimes used as an *add-on* treatment to antidepressants for MDD when initial treatment isn't sufficient. It's not a first-line treatment for MDD on its own.

* **Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder:** Aripiprazole can help reduce irritability in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.

* **Tourette's Disorder:**  It's also approved for treating motor and phonic tics associated with Tourette's syndrome.

* **Agitation:**  Aripiprazole can be used to treat agitation associated with both schizophrenia and bipolar mania.  This is often given via injection for rapid symptom relief.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  The following is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Schizophrenia (Oral):** Typically starts at 10-15 mg once daily, with potential increases up to a maximum of 30 mg daily.
* **Schizophrenia (Intramuscular, extended-release):** 400 mg once monthly.  Oral aripiprazole is often used for the first two weeks to reach therapeutic levels before the injection.
* **Bipolar I Disorder (Oral):**  Dosage varies depending on whether it's used as monotherapy or add-on therapy with other medications.  It generally starts around 15 mg daily and can increase up to 30 mg.
* **Bipolar I Disorder (Intramuscular, extended-release):** 400mg once monthly, similar to schizophrenia, often with an initial oral dose.
* **Major Depressive Disorder (Oral):**  Starts at a much lower dose (2-5 mg daily) as an add-on therapy and is gradually increased as needed, not exceeding 15 mg daily.
* **Agitation (Intramuscular):**  Dosage and frequency will depend on the severity of agitation.  It’s typically started at 9.75 mg to 15mg, with a maximum total daily dose of 30 mg.


**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children and adolescents depends heavily on age, weight, and the specific condition.  It is crucial to consult a pediatrician or child psychiatrist for appropriate dosing and monitoring. Generally, lower starting doses are used, with gradual increases based on response and tolerance.  Specific conditions (autism, Tourette's) often have different starting and maximum doses.


**Forms:**  Aripiprazole is available in oral tablets (immediate-release and extended-release), oral solution, orally disintegrating tablets, and intramuscular (IM) injections (long-acting).

### How it Works

Aripiprazole is a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and an antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor.  In simpler terms, it influences the balance of certain brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that play a role in mood, thinking, and behavior.  By partially stimulating dopamine and serotonin receptors, and blocking others, aripiprazole helps regulate brain activity and alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  The precise mechanism isn't fully understood, but the effect is to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms and mood instability.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Aripiprazole is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to aripiprazole or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aripiprazole's metabolism can be affected by other medications, leading to increased or decreased levels in the blood. Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor before starting aripiprazole.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Aripiprazole is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy has not been definitively established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.  It’s also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should carefully weigh the pros and cons with their physician.
* **Elderly Patients with Dementia:**  Aripiprazole is not approved for use in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis due to an increased risk of death.
* **Suicidal Ideation:**  There’s an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in young adults. Close monitoring is essential, particularly during the initial stages of treatment.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:** Use with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular problems due to the potential for orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing).
* **Seizures:**  Use caution in patients with a history of seizures or conditions that lower the seizure threshold.

### FAQs

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking aripiprazole?** No, alcohol can worsen the sedative effects of aripiprazole and should be avoided.
* **How should I store aripiprazole?** Store it at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Can I stop taking aripiprazole suddenly?** No, abruptly stopping aripiprazole can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication.  They will help you taper off the medication gradually.
* **Is aripiprazole habit-forming?** Aripiprazole is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids, but stopping it abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms.
* **How long will it take before I see results?** The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.  Be patient and work with your doctor.
