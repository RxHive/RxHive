# Aripiprazole

**Generic Name:** Aripiprazole

**Usage:**

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to treat several mental health conditions, including:

* **Schizophrenia:**  To manage the positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking) and negative symptoms (flat affect, social withdrawal, lack of motivation) of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents (age 15 and older).
* **Bipolar I Disorder (manic or mixed episodes):** To treat manic or mixed episodes in adults and to prevent them from recurring.  It's also used as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers in adults.
* **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** As an add-on treatment to an antidepressant in adults who haven't responded adequately to the antidepressant alone.
* **Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder:** To reduce irritability associated with autistic disorder in children and adolescents (age 6 and older).
* **Tourette's Disorder:** To treat motor and phonic (vocal) tics in adults and adolescents (age 13 and older).

The specific dosage and frequency will vary depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and other factors.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.


**Side Effects:**

Aripiprazole, like other antipsychotics, can cause a range of side effects, some common and some less frequent.  These can include:

* **Common:**  Somnolence (sleepiness), insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, weight gain, akathisia (restlessness), extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as tremor, muscle stiffness, and involuntary movements (though less common with aripiprazole than with older antipsychotics).
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) – a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability; tardive dyskinesia (TD) – a potentially irreversible movement disorder characterized by involuntary repetitive movements;  increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior; metabolic changes (increased blood sugar and cholesterol).
* **Other Potential Side Effects:**  Prolactin elevation (can lead to galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia), orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), seizures.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects vary greatly between individuals.


**How it Works:**

Aripiprazole is a dopamine system stabilizer.  Unlike many other antipsychotics that primarily block dopamine receptors, aripiprazole acts as a partial agonist at D2 dopamine receptors.  This means it partially stimulates these receptors while also blocking them at higher concentrations.  It also affects serotonin receptors. This dual action is thought to contribute to its effectiveness in treating various psychotic and mood disorders by improving the balance of dopamine and serotonin activity in the brain.


**FAQs:**

* **Is aripiprazole addictive?**  Aripiprazole is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or other substances. However, stopping it abruptly after long-term use can sometimes lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult a doctor before stopping the medication.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking aripiprazole?**  It's generally recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking aripiprazole, as alcohol can interact with the medication and worsen side effects.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of aripiprazole may not be fully noticeable for several weeks.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can aripiprazole cause weight gain?** Yes, weight gain is a potential side effect.  Regular monitoring of weight and lifestyle adjustments may be necessary.
* **What are the long-term effects of aripiprazole?** Long-term use can increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia and other metabolic changes. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.
