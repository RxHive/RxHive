# Amylmetacresol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
### Generic Name
Amylmetacresol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu, specifically coughs and sore throats.  Amylmetacresol is a local anesthetic and antiseptic that helps to numb the throat and reduce pain and inflammation associated with a sore throat. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide is a cough suppressant (an antitussive) that works on the brain to reduce the urge to cough.  It's important to understand that this medication treats *symptoms* and doesn't cure the underlying viral infection causing the cold or flu.  It's typically used for non-productive coughs (coughs without mucus).  It's not usually recommended for coughs associated with excessive mucus production.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation (e.g., lozenges, syrup) and the patient's age and weight. Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.  

**Adults:**  Dosage information will vary greatly based on the specific product, but generally, follow the manufacturer's recommended dose.  Never exceed the maximum daily dose.

**Children:**  This medication is often not recommended for young children (generally under 6 years old) due to the potential side effects and difficulty administering the medication correctly.  Always consult a pediatrician before giving this medication to a child.  Specific dosage for children will be clearly stated on the packaging for any formulations approved for pediatric use.


**Oral Administration:** This medication is typically administered orally, either as lozenges to be dissolved in the mouth or as a liquid syrup.  Follow the specific instructions printed on the label regarding frequency and dosage.

### How it Works

Amylmetacresol works locally in the throat. Its anesthetic properties numb the throat's irritated tissues, reducing pain and discomfort associated with a sore throat. Its antiseptic action helps to kill some bacteria that might be contributing to the infection.

Dextromethorphan hydrobromide works centrally in the brain.  It acts on specific receptors in the brain that suppress the cough reflex, reducing the frequency of coughs.
