# Acrivastine + Pesudoephedrine
### Generic Name
Acrivastine + Pseudoephedrine

### Usage
Acrivastine and Pseudoephedrine is a combination medication used primarily to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  This includes symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and watery eyes. The medication combines an antihistamine (acrivastine) which works to reduce allergic reactions, and a decongestant (pseudoephedrine) which helps to relieve stuffiness by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.  It's important to note that this combination is not a cure for allergies, but rather a treatment for the symptoms.

### Dosage
**Adults (12 years and older):** For seasonal allergic rhinitis, the typical dose is one capsule (containing 8mg acrivastine and 60mg pseudoephedrine) every 4-6 hours, not exceeding four doses in a 24-hour period.

**Children (under 12 years):**  The safety and efficacy of this combination have not been established in children under 12 years old.  This medication should not be given to this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment. However, it's not recommended for individuals with renal (kidney) impairment where creatinine clearance (CrCl) is less than 48 mL/min. Always consult a healthcare professional for dosage adjustments based on individual health conditions.  

The medication is typically taken orally as capsules.

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.  Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns about any side effects.

### How it Works
Acrivastine, the antihistamine component, blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine causes many of the symptoms of allergies. By blocking histamine, acrivastine helps to reduce sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.

Pseudoephedrine, the decongestant, works by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages.  This reduces swelling and congestion, making it easier to breathe.  The combination of these two actions provides relief from the multiple symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with:

* Allergy to acrivastine, pseudoephedrine, other alkylamine antihistamines (like chlorpheniramine), or any other ingredient in the formulation.
* Patients currently taking, or within 14 days of taking, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
* Severe hypertension (high blood pressure) or severe coronary artery disease.

**Use with Caution:**  This medication should be used cautiously in patients with:

* Cardiovascular disease
* Diabetes mellitus
* Increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma
* Prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) or genitourinary obstruction
* Pyloroduodenal obstruction (including stenotic peptic ulcer)
* Renal impairment
* Thyroid dysfunction
* Elderly patients

**Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, particularly CNS depressants (including alcohol), alpha-/beta-agonists, gastrointestinal prokinetics, and anticholinergic agents.  It is crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Acrivastine is categorized as pregnancy category B (animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking). Pseudoephedrine's excretion in breast milk is known, and the risk-benefit should be carefully considered for breastfeeding mothers. Always consult with your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
