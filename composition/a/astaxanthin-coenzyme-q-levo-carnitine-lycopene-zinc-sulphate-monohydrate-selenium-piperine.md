# Astaxanthin + Coenzyme Q + Levo-carnitine + Lycopene + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Selenium + Piperine

## Astaxanthin + Coenzyme Q10 + Levo-carnitine + Lycopene + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate + Selenium + Piperine

**Generic Name:**  This is a combination supplement; there isn't one single generic name.  Each ingredient has its own generic name (e.g., Astaxanthin, Ubiquinone (CoQ10), L-Carnitine, Lycopene, Zinc Sulfate, Selenium, Piperine).

**Usage:** This combination supplement is often marketed for its purported benefits in supporting cardiovascular health, energy production, antioxidant protection, and immune function.  Individual components have specific roles:

* **Astaxanthin:**  A powerful antioxidant.
* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** Involved in energy production within cells.  May support heart health.
* **Levo-carnitine:**  Plays a role in fatty acid metabolism and energy production.
* **Lycopene:**  A carotenoid with antioxidant properties.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  An essential mineral with various roles in the body, including immune function.
* **Selenium:**  An essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties.
* **Piperine:**  An alkaloid found in black pepper, potentially enhancing the bioavailability of other ingredients.


**Side Effects:** Side effects vary depending on the individual and the dosage of each component.  Potential side effects include:

* **Astaxanthin:** Generally well-tolerated, but some may experience mild gastrointestinal upset.  High doses might cause diarrhea.
* **Coenzyme Q10:** Generally well-tolerated.  Rarely, headaches or nausea may occur.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Usually well-tolerated.  High doses can cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  In rare cases, it may interact with certain medications.
* **Lycopene:** Generally safe, but high doses may cause digestive upset.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  High doses can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  Long-term high doses can cause copper deficiency.
* **Selenium:**  High doses can be toxic.  Symptoms of toxicity include hair loss, nail changes, and neurological problems.
* **Piperine:**  Can interact with certain medications, affecting their metabolism.  May cause gastrointestinal upset in high doses.

**How it Works:**  The mechanism of action varies for each ingredient.  The combination is thought to work synergistically, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of individual effects.  For example:

* **Antioxidant effects:** Astaxanthin, lycopene, and selenium work as antioxidants, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.
* **Energy production:** CoQ10 and levo-carnitine support energy production in the mitochondria (the powerhouses of cells).
* **Bioavailability enhancement:** Piperine may enhance the absorption and bioavailability of other ingredients in the supplement.
* **Immune support:** Zinc and selenium play crucial roles in immune function.
