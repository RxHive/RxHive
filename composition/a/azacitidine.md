# Azacitidine
### Generic Name
Azacitidine

### Usage

Azacitidine is a medication used to treat certain types of blood cancers.  Its primary use is in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a group of cancers affecting the bone marrow's ability to produce healthy blood cells.  Specific MDS subtypes treated include refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) – particularly if accompanied by low neutrophil or platelet counts or requiring blood transfusions – refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL).

Azacitidine is also used in the maintenance treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who have achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) after intensive chemotherapy, but are unable to undergo further intensive treatment.  In some cases, it's used off-label in combination with other drugs for AML patients, especially older adults or those with significant health issues requiring less intense therapy.

### Dosage

Azacitidine is available in both injectable and tablet forms, with different dosage regimens for each.  Dosage also varies depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's size and overall health, and response to treatment.  **It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions**.

**Myelodysplastic Syndromes (Injection):**  The typical initial cycle involves 75 mg/m² per day given intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SubQ) for seven days, repeated every 28 days. The dose may be increased to 100 mg/m² per day if there's no response after two cycles and no significant side effects beyond nausea and vomiting. Treatment continues for at least 4-6 cycles, or as long as the patient benefits.  Alternative schedules exist (off-label) using various subcutaneous injections with slightly altered dosages and days of administration within the 28-day cycle, these are often dictated by patient response and tolerance.

**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Tablet):**  For AML maintenance, the usual dose is 300 mg once daily (OD) for days 1-14 of a 28-day cycle. Treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable side effects occur.  Antiemetics are usually prescribed for the first two cycles to manage nausea and vomiting.

**Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Injection, off-label low-intensity):**  For older patients or those with significant comorbidities, lower-dose azacitidine may be used intravenously or subcutaneously in combination with other medications like venetoclax. The specific dosage regimen will be determined by the treating oncologist.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Use in children is less common and is usually only implemented under close medical supervision. Dosages are calculated based on body surface area (mg/m²) and are usually given subcutaneously or intravenously.  Exact pediatric regimens must be determined by the patient's oncologist.


### Side Effects

Azacitidine can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  It's essential to report any concerning symptoms to a doctor immediately.

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, headache, dizziness, low blood cell counts (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), injection site reactions (if applicable).
* **Serious (Less Common):** Severe infections due to low white blood cell counts, bleeding due to low platelet counts, liver problems, kidney problems, allergic reactions, lung problems (pneumonitis, pulmonary edema).


### How it Works

Azacitidine is a hypomethylating agent. It works by altering the way DNA and RNA are modified within cancer cells.  Specifically, it inhibits DNA methyltransferases, enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA. This modification can change how genes are expressed, potentially reactivating tumor suppressor genes and inducing cellular differentiation—leading to a reduction in cancer cell growth and promoting healthy cell function.  By modifying DNA and RNA methylation, azacitidine helps restore normal cell function and reduces cancer cell proliferation.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Azacitidine is contraindicated for patients with a known allergy to azacitidine, mannitol, or any other component of the formulation. Advanced malignant hepatic tumors are also a contraindication for injection.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Azacitidine can significantly suppress bone marrow function, leading to low blood cell counts. Regular blood tests are crucial to monitor this.
* **Hepatotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity:** Liver and kidney damage are potential risks.  Regular monitoring of liver and kidney function is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Azacitidine can harm a developing fetus and should not be used during pregnancy.  Effective contraception is essential for both male and female patients during treatment and for a period afterward. Breastfeeding should be stopped during and for a week after treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Azacitidine can interact with various other medications.  It is crucial to inform a doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Older Adults and Patients with Comorbidities:** Older adults and patients with other health problems may be at increased risk of side effects and require closer monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is azacitidine stored?** A: Storage conditions vary based on the formulation (tablet versus injection).  Check the product label for specific storage instructions.  Generally, medications should be kept in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If using the tablet form, take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day; do not take two doses on the same day. For injectable forms, consult your physician regarding a missed dose.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking azacitidine?** A:  It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking azacitidine, as it can add to the risk of liver damage and interact negatively with the medication. Always consult with your doctor about this.
* **Q: How long will I need to take azacitidine?** A: The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the individual, the type of cancer, and the response to therapy.  A healthcare provider will determine the optimal treatment duration.
