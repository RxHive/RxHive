# Amphotericin B Cholesteryl Sulfate
### Generic Name
Amphotericin B Cholesteryl Sulfate

### Usage
Amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate is a systemic antifungal medication primarily used to treat invasive aspergillosis.  This is a serious fungal infection, often affecting individuals with weakened immune systems. It's particularly indicated in patients where treatment with the standard amphotericin B deoxycholate has proven ineffective, caused unacceptable toxicity, or is contraindicated due to renal impairment.  While primarily used for aspergillosis, it may be considered for other serious fungal infections in certain situations,  depending on a physician's assessment.  The decision to use this formulation hinges on the patient's individual circumstances and response to other treatments.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** For invasive aspergillosis, the typical intravenous (IV) dosage range is 3-4 mg/kg/day.  Premedication with NSAIDs (with or without diphenhydramine), acetaminophen with diphenhydramine, or hydrocortisone (50-100 mg with or without an NSAID and diphenhydramine) 30-60 minutes before administration is often recommended to mitigate infusion reactions like chills, fever, hypotension, or nausea.  A test dose (10 mL of the prepared solution, containing 1.6-8.3 mg) infused over 15-30 minutes with 30 minutes of observation is advisable for the first dose of a new treatment course.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage varies widely depending on the specific fungal infection being treated (aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis), the child's age, weight, and the severity of the illness.  It is crucial to follow a physician's precise instructions.  Generally, intravenous doses range from 3-5 mg/kg/day, often given once daily.  The exact regimen depends on the specific infection and the physician's assessment.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. Safety and efficacy in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment haven't been established.  Careful monitoring of renal and liver function is essential during treatment.

### How it Works

Amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate binds to ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This binding creates pores or channels in the membrane, disrupting its integrity.  This leads to leakage of essential ions (potassium, sodium, hydrogen, chloride) from the fungal cells, ultimately causing cell death and inhibiting fungal growth.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to amphotericin B or any components of the formulation.  Anaphylaxis is a potential risk.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions are common.  Premedication is often necessary.
* **Renal and Hepatic Function:** Close monitoring of renal and liver function is vital, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Amphotericin B can cause electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia). Regular electrolyte monitoring is necessary.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Amphotericin B can interact with many drugs, potentially increasing the risk of toxicity or reducing efficacy.  Inform your physician of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amphotericin B is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended during treatment.
* **Geriatric Patients:** Use caution in elderly patients due to increased susceptibility to adverse effects.
