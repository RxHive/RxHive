# Ammonium Lactate
### Generic Name
Ammonium Lactate

### Usage
Ammonium lactate is primarily used topically to treat ichthyosis vulgaris and moderate-to-severe xerosis (dry skin).  It acts as a humectant, meaning it helps the skin retain moisture. This is particularly beneficial for conditions characterized by dry, scaly skin.  While its primary use focuses on these specific dermatological issues,  it's important to note that its use should be guided by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (cream or lotion) and the age of the patient.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:** For ichthyosis vulgaris and moderate-to-severe xerosis, ammonium lactate cream (12%) or lotion (12%, 0.5%, or 10%) is typically applied twice daily (BID) to the affected areas.  Rub it in thoroughly until absorbed.

**Children:**  The dosage for children generally mirrors that of adults, using the appropriate lotion formulation (12%, 0.5%, or 10%) twice daily. For children aged 2 years and older, the 12% cream may also be used.  However, always consult a pediatrician before using ammonium lactate on children, particularly infants.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, because systemic absorption is low, adjustments may not be necessary.  This should still be discussed with a doctor.


### Side Effects
The most common side effects associated with topical ammonium lactate application are generally mild.  However, it is crucial to report any adverse reactions to your doctor.

* **Common (More than 10%):** Burning/stinging sensation, rash (including erythema and irritation).
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Itching, dry skin.

While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  Stop using the medication and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unexpected or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
Ammonium lactate acts as a humectant, drawing moisture into the skin and helping it retain hydration.  This helps to soften and reduce the scaling and dryness characteristic of conditions like ichthyosis vulgaris and xerosis. While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood,  its ability to improve skin hydration is the key to its therapeutic effect.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ammonium lactate should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to lactic acid, ammonium hydroxide, or any other components of the formulation.
* **Interactions:** Lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide (components of ammonium lactate) might decrease the effectiveness of calcipotriene.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are using.
* **Warnings:**  Ammonium lactate may increase the risk of burning/stinging and photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight). Minimize sun exposure, and use protective clothing if sun exposure is unavoidable.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Ammonium lactate is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. However, excretion in breast milk is unknown. Use caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and consult your doctor.
