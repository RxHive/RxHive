# Apomorphine
### Generic Name
Apomorphine

### Usage
Apomorphine is primarily used for the acute, intermittent treatment of "off" episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease.  "Off" episodes refer to periods when the effects of Parkinson's medication wear off, resulting in a return of symptoms like rigidity, tremor, and slow movement.  It's important to note that apomorphine is not a replacement for regular Parkinson's medication but rather a rescue medication used to manage these temporary worsening periods.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Apomorphine dosage is highly individualized and requires close medical supervision, particularly during initial titration. The information below provides general guidelines; *always follow your doctor's specific instructions*.

**Adults:**

* **Subcutaneous (SubQ) Injection:**  Initiation involves a careful titration process with test doses under medical supervision, usually starting with 0.2 mL (2 mg) and increasing in increments of 0.1 mL (1 mg) every few days as tolerated and based on response. Blood pressure monitoring is crucial before and after each test dose.  The maximum dose is generally 0.6 mL (6 mg), and the total daily dose rarely exceeds 2 mL (20 mg). Doses are usually spaced 2 hours apart.

* **Sublingual Film:** The usual starting dose is 10 mg taken under the tongue as needed during an "off" episode. The dose can be increased in 5 mg increments to a maximum of 30 mg per dose.  A maximum of 5 doses per day is recommended, and doses should be at least 2 hours apart.  If one dose is ineffective for a given "off" episode, a second dose should not be given for that episode.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of apomorphine in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically needed but proceed with caution. For severe impairment, avoid use (sublingual film) or follow your physician's specific guidance (SubQ).

* **Renal Impairment:** For mild to moderate impairment, a lower starting dose may be necessary (SubQ).  For severe impairment, use is generally avoided (sublingual film and SubQ).

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of users):**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Falling
* Hallucinations
* Yawning
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure when standing)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Nausea
* Vomiting


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Cardiovascular:** Angina, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat (including potentially life-threatening arrhythmias).
* **Neurological:** Severe confusion, agitation, psychosis, impulse control disorders (including pathological gambling), sleep attacks.
* **Other:**  Severe nausea and vomiting, injection site reactions, priapism (prolonged painful erection).


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control.  In Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing brain cells are damaged, leading to movement problems.  Apomorphine binds to dopamine receptors in the brain, stimulating them and temporarily alleviating the symptoms of "off" episodes. While its exact mechanism in managing "off" episodes is not completely understood, its action on dopamine receptors in the brain is the primary mode of therapeutic action.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Apomorphine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to apomorphine or any formulation component, concomitant use with 5-HT3 antagonists (certain anti-nausea medications) or certain antihypertensives, and those with severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Apomorphine can interact with numerous other medications, including antipsychotics, antihypertensives, and others.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Specific Warnings:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, pre-existing dyskinesias, or those at risk of QT interval prolongation. Close monitoring is needed during initial titration, especially in older adults.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Apomorphine is a Category C medication during pregnancy. The risk to the fetus is unknown, and use should be carefully weighed against the potential benefit.  The excretion of apomorphine in breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration of the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while on this medication.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does apomorphine take to work?** A: The onset of action can vary, but it usually provides relief within minutes to a half-hour.

* **Q: How should apomorphine be stored?** A:  Store apomorphine according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, typically away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop apomorphine suddenly?** A:  No, sudden cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before discontinuing this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  For sublingual film, take the missed dose as soon as you remember if it's still relevant for an "off" episode. Do not double the dose. Consult your doctor about missing a SubQ dose.

* **Q: Is apomorphine addictive?** A:  While physical dependence can occur with long-term use, the risk of addiction is generally low compared to other medications.
