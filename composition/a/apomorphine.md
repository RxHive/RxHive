# Apomorphine

**Generic Name:** Apomorphine

**Usage:**

Apomorphine is used to treat the "off" episodes experienced by people with Parkinson's disease.  These "off" episodes are periods when the medication they are taking to control their symptoms is no longer effective, leading to a worsening of motor symptoms such as rigidity, tremor, slow movement (bradykinesia), and difficulty with coordination.  It's typically used as a rescue medication for these episodes, meaning it's taken only when symptoms become problematic.  It is also sometimes used to treat severe nausea and vomiting caused by other conditions.  *Important Note:*  Apomorphine is not a first-line treatment for Parkinson's disease and is usually used only after other medications have proven ineffective for managing "off" periods.  Prescription and administration require careful medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**

Apomorphine can cause a variety of side effects, some mild and others serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** This is a very common side effect and is often managed with anti-emetic medication.
* **Yawning:**  Frequent and uncontrollable yawning.
* **Drowsiness:**  Feeling sleepy or fatigued.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** This can cause dizziness and fainting.
* **Injection site reactions:**  Pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site.
* **Cardiac effects:**  Irregular heartbeat or changes in blood pressure.
* **Sleep attacks:** Sudden, irresistible urges to sleep.


Serious side effects, though less common, include:

* **Severe hypotension:** Leading to significant dizziness or fainting.
* **Hallucinations:** Seeing or hearing things that aren't there.
* **Psychotic symptoms:**  Delusions or disorganized thinking.
* **Sudden cardiac death:** Though rare, this is a potential risk.


**How it Works:**

Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of dopamine in the brain.  Dopamine is a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control.  In Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing neurons in the brain are damaged, leading to motor problems. Apomorphine stimulates dopamine receptors, providing temporary relief from the symptoms of Parkinson's disease "off" episodes.  It acts quickly, usually within minutes of subcutaneous injection.


**FAQs:**

* **How is apomorphine administered?**  Apomorphine is typically administered via subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  Oral administration is generally not effective due to significant first-pass metabolism.
* **Is apomorphine addictive?**  Apomorphine can be habit-forming, and tolerance can develop, meaning higher doses may be needed over time to achieve the same effect.
* **Who should not use apomorphine?**  Apomorphine should not be used by individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug, severe cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or certain psychiatric disorders.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also generally avoid it unless specifically prescribed by their physician.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Apomorphine can interact with many medications, especially those affecting the central nervous system or blood pressure. It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as severe hypotension, hallucinations, or significant worsening of symptoms.  They can adjust your dosage or recommend alternative treatments.
