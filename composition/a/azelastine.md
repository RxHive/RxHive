# Azelastine

**Generic Name:** Azelastine hydrochloride

**Usage:**

Azelastine is used to relieve the symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever and other year-round allergies).  It's available as both a nasal spray and an oral tablet.  The nasal spray is specifically for nasal allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, and nasal congestion. The oral tablet is generally used for the same symptoms, but might also be used to treat itchy, watery eyes and itchy throat associated with allergies.  It is important to note that the oral tablet is not approved in all countries for use in children. Always consult your physician for appropriate dosage and usage.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the administration route (nasal spray vs. oral tablet) and individual sensitivity. Common side effects can include:

* **Nasal Spray:**  Burning or stinging in the nose, drowsiness, headache, bitter taste.  Rarely, more serious side effects can occur.
* **Oral Tablet:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, bitter taste, nausea, fatigue, insomnia.  Rarely, more serious side effects can occur.

More serious side effects, though rare, can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Seizures (especially in individuals predisposed)


**How it Works:**

Azelastine is a type of medication called a mast cell stabilizer and H1-receptor antagonist.  This means it works in two ways:

1. **Mast cell stabilization:** It prevents the release of histamine and other chemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are immune cells that play a crucial role in allergic reactions.  By preventing the release of these chemicals, azelastine reduces the inflammatory response responsible for allergy symptoms.
2. **H1-receptor antagonism:**  It also blocks the action of histamine on H1 receptors. Histamine is a chemical released during allergic reactions that causes many of the symptoms.  By blocking these receptors, azelastine further reduces the allergic response.
