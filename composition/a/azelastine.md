# Azelastine
### Generic Name
Azelastine

### Usage
Azelastine is primarily used as an antihistamine to relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and perennial allergic rhinitis (year-round allergies).  These symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and eyes, and nasal congestion.  It's available in both nasal spray and oral forms. While less common, azelastine nasal spray is sometimes used to treat allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane covering the white part of the eye), offering relief from itchy, watery eyes.  It's important to note that azelastine doesn't prevent allergic reactions; it only manages symptoms.


### Dosage

**Azelastine Hydrochloride Nasal Spray:**

* **Adults and Children 12 years and older:**  One spray in each nostril twice daily (morning and evening).  Do not exceed the recommended dose.
* **Children under 12 years:**  Azelastine nasal spray is not typically recommended for children under 12 years old.  A doctor should determine the appropriate dosage and suitability in exceptional cases.

**Azelastine Hydrochloride Oral Tablets:**

* **Children under 12 years:**  Azelastine oral tablets are not usually prescribed for children younger than 12 years.


**Important Administration Guidelines:**

* For nasal spray, gently blow your nose before using the spray to clear nasal passages.  Hold the spray bottle upright, and spray while gently inhaling through your nose.

### How it Works

Azelastine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. Histamine is responsible for many of the uncomfortable symptoms of allergies. By blocking histamine's action, azelastine reduces inflammation in the nasal passages and eyes, providing relief from allergic symptoms.  The mechanism of action differs slightly between the oral and nasal routes of administration; however, the net result is similar: allergy symptom reduction.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using azelastine if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.
* **Interactions with Other Drugs:**  Azelastine may interact with other medications, including certain antidepressants and sedatives. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Liver or Kidney Disease:**  Caution is advised if you have liver or kidney disease, as the drug's metabolism and excretion may be affected. Your doctor may adjust the dosage accordingly.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Azelastine, particularly in oral form, may cause drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you feel sleepy or dizzy.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of azelastine, especially drowsiness.  A lower dose might be considered.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for azelastine to work?**  A:  The onset of action varies depending on the formulation and individual response.  Nasal spray may provide quicker relief than oral tablets.  You may experience symptom improvement within a few minutes to an hour.

* **Q: Can I use azelastine with other allergy medications?** A:  Discuss with your doctor before combining azelastine with other allergy medications to avoid potential drug interactions or unnecessary side effects.
