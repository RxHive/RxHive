# Aluminium Hydroxide + Dimethicone + Milk Of Magnesia
### Generic Name

Aluminium Hydroxide + Dimethicone + Milk of Magnesia (Combination Antacid)


This combination is not a single generic medicine with a specific name but rather a formulation combining three commonly used antacids.  It's crucial to understand that the exact ratios of these ingredients can vary between brands.  Therefore, always refer to the specific product labeling for precise composition details.


### Usage

This combination antacid is primarily used to relieve the symptoms of heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach.  The individual components work synergistically to neutralize stomach acid.

* **Aluminium Hydroxide:** Neutralizes stomach acid.
* **Dimethicone:**  Reduces bloating and gas by breaking up gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines.
* **Milk of Magnesia (Magnesium Hydroxide):**  Neutralizes stomach acid and has a mild laxative effect, which can help relieve constipation sometimes associated with other antacids.

This combination is generally used for short-term relief of these symptoms.  It is not a treatment for underlying conditions like peptic ulcers or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  For chronic or severe symptoms, a healthcare professional should be consulted.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary widely depending on the specific product formulation and the patient's age and health status.  Always follow the directions printed on the product label.  **Never exceed the recommended dose.**  Generally, oral doses are taken several times daily, typically after meals and at bedtime.

**Dosage for Adults (Oral):**  Specific instructions will be on the product label but usually involves taking one to two tablets or a specific measured amount of liquid suspension as directed, several times a day.  

**Dosage for Children (Oral):**  The use of this medication in children should only be done under strict medical supervision.  A pediatrician should determine appropriate dosage and administration.  This combination is typically not recommended for infants and young children.

**IV Administration:** This combination is not administered intravenously.  It is only intended for oral use.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Constipation (especially with aluminum hydroxide), diarrhea (especially with magnesium hydroxide), mild stomach upset, gas.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Although rare, prolonged use can lead to an imbalance of electrolytes in the body.  This is especially a concern for individuals with kidney problems.  Symptoms could include muscle weakness, confusion, or irregular heartbeat.  Allergic reactions, such as rash or itching, are possible, though infrequent.

**Note:** If any side effects, including those not listed here, persist or worsen, consult a doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

The medication works by neutralizing stomach acid.

* **Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide:** These act as antacids, chemically reacting with stomach acid (hydrochloric acid) to form less acidic salts and water.  This reduces the acidity in the stomach, relieving heartburn and indigestion.
* **Dimethicone:**  This ingredient is an anti-foaming agent. It reduces surface tension of gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily, thus reducing bloating and gas.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This combination should not be used by individuals with known allergies to any of the ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This antacid can interfere with the absorption of other medications.  Take other medicines at least 2 hours before or after taking this combination antacid.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist regarding potential interactions with other medications, especially those requiring precise absorption.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. While generally considered safe, the potential effects on the fetus or nursing infant warrant a healthcare provider's advice.
* **Elderly and Individuals with Kidney Problems:**  Individuals with kidney problems should use this medication with caution due to the risk of electrolyte imbalances.  The elderly, who may have pre-existing kidney issues, should consult their doctor before use.
* **Long-term Use:**  This medication is intended for short-term use only.  Prolonged use without medical supervision is not recommended.
