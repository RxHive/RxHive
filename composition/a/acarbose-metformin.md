# Acarbose + Metformin

**Generic Name:** Acarbose + Metformin (various brand names exist,  often combining the individual drug names)

**Usage:**

Acarbose and metformin combination therapy is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. It's typically prescribed when metformin alone isn't sufficient to achieve target blood glucose levels.  This combination works by targeting different aspects of glucose metabolism.  The prescribing physician will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs and response.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  These are particularly common with both acarbose and metformin.  They can include diarrhea, bloating, gas (flatulence), abdominal cramps, and nausea.  These side effects are often more pronounced at the beginning of treatment and may lessen over time as the body adjusts.

* **Metformin-specific:**  Lactic acidosis (a rare but serious condition), vitamin B12 deficiency (long-term use), metallic taste.

* **Acarbose-specific:**  Increased gas production, abdominal discomfort, liver enzyme elevation (rare).

* **Other:**  Headache, dizziness,  hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), particularly if combined with insulin or other diabetes medications.


**How it Works:**

This combination therapy works through two distinct mechanisms:

* **Metformin:**  It primarily works by decreasing glucose production by the liver and improving insulin sensitivity in the muscles and fat tissues.  It also slightly reduces glucose absorption from the intestines.

* **Acarbose:** It's an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor.  This means it slows down the breakdown of carbohydrates in the small intestine, leading to a slower and more gradual rise in blood sugar levels after meals.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible. Certain medications, particularly those affecting kidney function, may need dose adjustment or contraindicated.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: What are the signs of lactic acidosis?** A: Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect of metformin. Symptoms include muscle pain or weakness, unusual tiredness, shortness of breath, stomach pain, and feeling cold. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided, especially with metformin, as it can increase the risk of lactic acidosis.  Moderation is advised and consult your physician.

* **Q:  What should I do about dietary changes?** A:  A healthy diet low in saturated fats and refined sugars remains crucial for effective blood sugar management.  Your doctor or a registered dietitian can provide personalized dietary guidance.

* **Q:  How often do I need blood tests?** A: Your doctor will determine the frequency of blood tests needed to monitor your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and other relevant parameters.
