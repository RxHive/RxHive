# Acyclovir + Hydrocortisone
### Generic Name
Acyclovir + Hydrocortisone

### Usage

Acyclovir and hydrocortisone topical cream is primarily used to treat recurrent herpes labialis, commonly known as cold sores.  It combines the antiviral properties of acyclovir with the anti-inflammatory effects of hydrocortisone. Acyclovir works by interfering with the herpes simplex virus's ability to replicate, thus reducing the duration and severity of the outbreak.  Hydrocortisone helps to reduce swelling, pain, and itching associated with the cold sore.  This combination therapy aims to provide faster symptom relief and quicker healing.  It's crucial to remember that this medication is for topical use only and should not be used for other types of herpes infections or viral illnesses.

### Dosage

**Herpes Labialis (Cold Sores):**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥6 years:** Apply a thin layer of the cream to the affected area five times daily for five days. Treatment should ideally begin at the first sign of a cold sore (prodrome) or when lesions appear.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  These may include:

* Burning sensation
* Tingling
* Erythema (redness)
* Mild irritation

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Skin discoloration (dyschromia)
* Exfoliation (peeling) of the skin
* Skin dryness (xeroderma)

If any significant or persistent side effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Acyclovir, the antiviral component, is converted into its active form (acyclovir triphosphate) inside virus-infected cells.  This active form inhibits viral DNA polymerase, an enzyme essential for viral DNA replication. By blocking this enzyme, acyclovir effectively stops the herpes simplex virus from multiplying and spreading.

Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. It reduces inflammation, swelling, and itching by suppressing the body's inflammatory response at the site of the cold sore.  This dual action of antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties leads to faster healing and reduced discomfort.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to acyclovir, hydrocortisone, or any components of the formulation. It should not be used on individuals with untreated bacterial, viral, tuberculous, or fungal infections of the affected area.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in immunocompromised patients, as their immune systems may be less able to fight off infection. Avoid using this medication in the eyes, inside the mouth or nose, or on the genitals.  
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Systemic absorption of acyclovir and hydrocortisone following topical application is minimal. However, the decision to use this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits of treatment against potential risks to the mother and infant.
