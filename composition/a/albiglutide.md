# Albiglutide
### Generic Name
Albiglutide

### Usage
Albiglutide is primarily used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  This means it's used *in addition* to lifestyle changes, not as a replacement.  It's not suitable for treating type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.


### Dosage
**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes):** Albiglutide is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once weekly. The starting dose is typically 30 mg.  If blood sugar control remains inadequate, the dose may be increased to 50 mg once weekly.  Different injection sites (upper arm, thigh, or abdomen) should be used each week.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of albiglutide in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15-89 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustment is necessary, but caution should be exercised when starting or increasing the dose.  Dosage adjustments for patients with eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m² are not specifically defined in current prescribing information.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Injection site reactions (redness, rash, itching)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less):**

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) – seek immediate medical attention if severe abdominal pain occurs.
* Gallbladder problems
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) – seek immediate medical attention.
* Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity)
* Worsening kidney function or acute kidney injury
* Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
* Thyroid tumors (rare but a serious concern; see Precautions)


If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed above, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Albiglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.  GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Albiglutide mimics the action of GLP-1. It works by:

* Increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas when blood sugar is high.
* Decreasing the release of glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar).
* Slowing the rate at which food empties from the stomach.


These actions contribute to lowering blood sugar levels and improving glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Albiglutide is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity (such as angioedema) to albiglutide or any component of the formulation, a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2).

**Warnings:** There is an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, gallbladder disease, acute pancreatitis, renal effects (worsening renal failure and acute kidney injury), and thyroid C-cell tumors.  There’s also a potential for macrovascular outcomes to be impacted, and hypoglycemia is a risk, especially when used with insulin or other insulin secretagogues.

**Specific Populations:**

* **Pregnancy:** Albiglutide is a Category C drug during pregnancy. Other agents are generally preferred for diabetes management during pregnancy.  Discontinue albiglutide at least one month before a planned pregnancy.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether albiglutide is excreted in breast milk; a decision should be made regarding breastfeeding or medication use based on the individual's needs.
* **Elderly and Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised when using albiglutide in older adults and those with renal impairment (see Dosage Adjustments).

**Drug Interactions:** Albiglutide may interact with other medications, including insulin, sulfonylureas, and other drugs affecting blood sugar.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist regarding potential interactions.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I mix albiglutide with other medications in the same syringe?**
A: No, do not mix albiglutide with other medications.  It should be administered as a separate injection.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Administer the missed dose as soon as possible within 3 days. If more than 3 days have passed, skip the missed dose and resume the regular schedule.

**Q: How should I store albiglutide?**
A: Store albiglutide as directed on the product labeling.

**Q:  Is albiglutide a cure for diabetes?**
A: No, albiglutide is not a cure for diabetes. It helps manage blood sugar levels but is not a substitute for lifestyle changes or, in some cases, insulin therapy.

**Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?**
A: Severe abdominal pain (pancreatitis), swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), severe allergic reaction, or worsening kidney function are signs of serious side effects.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
