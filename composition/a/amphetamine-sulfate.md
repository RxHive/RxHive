# Amphetamine Sulfate
### Generic Name
Amphetamine Sulfate

### Usage
Amphetamine sulfate is a central nervous system stimulant primarily used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children and adults.  It's also indicated for the treatment of narcolepsy (a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness) and, less commonly, exogenous obesity (obesity not caused by underlying medical conditions).  The use of amphetamine for obesity is less prevalent due to the availability of other, potentially safer, weight-loss options.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The following information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice.  Dosage must be determined and adjusted by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response.  Never alter your dosage without consulting your doctor.

**Adults:**

* **ADHD:** Dosage varies widely depending on the formulation (immediate-release, extended-release tablet or suspension).  Initial doses are typically low and gradually increased under close medical supervision.  Maximum daily doses also vary based on formulation.
* **Narcolepsy:**  Initial doses are usually higher than for ADHD and are increased gradually until an optimal response is achieved.  The total daily dose is divided into multiple administrations.
* **Exogenous Obesity:**  Lower doses are typically used, usually given before meals.

**Children:**

* **ADHD:**  Dosage is significantly lower for children than for adults and is carefully adjusted according to age, weight, and response.  Immediate-release and extended-release formulations are available, with different starting and maximum doses.  Close monitoring is crucial.
* **Narcolepsy:**  Dosage in children is determined individually and carefully adjusted based on the child's age and response, starting with lower doses than in adults.

**Dosage Forms:** Amphetamine sulfate comes in various forms, including immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and extended-release oral suspensions.  Administration guidelines differ slightly depending on the formulation, with some requiring administration with food, while others may be taken without food.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional and the medication packaging.

### How it Works

Amphetamine sulfate is a stimulant that increases the release and blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters in the brain that affect alertness, attention, and mood.  In ADHD, this helps improve focus and reduce impulsivity.  In narcolepsy, it helps combat excessive daytime sleepiness.  Its effect on weight loss is thought to be related to its suppression of appetite.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amphetamine sulfate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to amphetamines, those currently taking or recently stopped monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), individuals with severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or advanced arteriosclerosis.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Amphetamine can interact with many other medications, including MAOIs, antidepressants, antihypertensives, and others.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amphetamine sulfate is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug, meaning its safety during pregnancy has not been established.  It is also excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking this medication.
* **Elderly and Children:** Careful dose adjustment is crucial for both elderly individuals and children.  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, while children require lower doses.
* **Cardiac Conditions:**  Individuals with heart conditions should use amphetamine sulfate with extreme caution due to the increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
