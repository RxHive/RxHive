# Air polymer-type A
### Generic Name
Air Polymer-Type A

### Usage

Air Polymer-Type A is an ultrasound contrast agent specifically used in sonohysterosalpingography (SHG).  SHG is a procedure used to assess the patency (openness) of the fallopian tubes in women who are experiencing infertility or have suspected infertility issues. The agent helps visualize the fallopian tubes during the ultrasound, allowing healthcare professionals to identify any blockages or abnormalities that might be hindering conception.  This is its primary and almost exclusive use.

### Dosage

**Sonohysterosalpingography (Imaging):**

* **Intrauterine Infusion:** The initial dose is typically 2-3 mL.  Additional doses of 2-3 mL may be administered as needed to adequately visualize the fallopian tubes. The maximum total dose should not exceed 10 mL.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Air Polymer-Type A have not been established in children.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Vasodepressor syncope (fainting)
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Pelvic pain
* Spotting

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Pelvic inflammatory disease
* Salpingitis (inflammation of the fallopian tubes)

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects after using Air Polymer-Type A, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Air Polymer-Type A is a foam created by mixing a clear gel with air and sterile purified water. This foam acts as an echogenic contrast agent, meaning it reflects ultrasound waves effectively.  When introduced into the uterus during SHG, the foam fills the fallopian tubes, making them clearly visible on the ultrasound image.  The presence or absence of blockages can then be determined by visualizing the flow of the foam through the tubes.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Pregnancy (use is contraindicated due to potential fetal risk)
* Known or suspected lower genital tract infection or inflammation
* History of a gynecologic procedure within the past 30 days
* Vaginal bleeding
* Known or suspected reproductive tract neoplasia (tumors)

**Warnings and Increased Risk:**

There is an increased risk of post-procedure gynecologic infections such as pelvic inflammatory disease, salpingitis, and tubo-ovarian abscess.  Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of infection after the procedure.

**Other Precautions:**

* Patients should be in the preovulatory phase of their menstrual cycle (cycle days 6-11) before the procedure.
* A negative pregnancy test is required within 24 hours before administration.
* The foam should be reconstituted (mixed) and administered within 5 minutes.
* Use a catheter of at least 5 French size for administration.  Do not force the infusion if resistance is encountered.
* Discard any unused portion of the medication.
