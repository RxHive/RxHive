# Avanafil
### Generic Name
Avanafil

### Usage
Avanafil is primarily used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, in adult men.  ED is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse.  Avanafil is not indicated for use in women or children.

### Dosage

**Adults (Erectile Dysfunction):**

Avanafil is administered orally. The recommended starting dose is 100 mg taken as needed, approximately 15 minutes before anticipated sexual activity.  The dose may be increased to 200 mg or decreased to 50 mg, depending on individual response and tolerability.  The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg per day, and it should only be taken once daily.  Sexual stimulation is necessary for Avanafil to be effective.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B). Avanafil is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥30 mL/min. Avanafil is not recommended for patients with CrCl <30 mL/min or those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis.
* **Concomitant Medications:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary when Avanafil is used with certain other medications.  For example, a lower starting dose (50 mg) is recommended when used with alpha-blockers.  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.  Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance on dosage adjustments based on other medications being taken.


**Pediatric Use:** Avanafil is not indicated for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old, as its safety and effectiveness in this population have not been established.

### How it Works

Avanafil belongs to a class of drugs called phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5) inhibitors.  It works by increasing blood flow to the penis. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide (NO) is released in the penis, leading to increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP causes relaxation of the smooth muscles in the penis, allowing increased blood flow and resulting in an erection.  Avanafil inhibits PDE5, the enzyme that breaks down cGMP.  By inhibiting PDE5, Avanafil allows cGMP levels to remain elevated, facilitating penile erection in response to sexual stimulation. Avanafil does not cause erections in the absence of sexual stimulation.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Avanafil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Avanafil or any of its components, and in those taking nitrates or riociguat (a guanylate cyclase stimulator).  These combinations can cause dangerously low blood pressure.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Avanafil can interact with several medications, including nitrates, alpha-blockers, other PDE5 inhibitors, and some antifungal and antibiotic medications.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution should be exercised when prescribing Avanafil to patients with heart conditions, high or low blood pressure, bleeding disorders, anatomical deformities of the penis, sickle cell anemia, leukemia, multiple myeloma, or retinitis pigmentosa.  The safety of Avanafil during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established; it is not indicated for use in women.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Excessive alcohol consumption can reduce the effectiveness of Avanafil and may increase the risk of side effects.
* **Priapism:** If a prolonged and painful erection lasting more than 4 hours occurs, seek immediate medical attention.
