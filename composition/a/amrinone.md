# Amrinone
### Generic Name
Amrinone

### Usage
Amrinone is primarily used to treat severe congestive heart failure (CHF) in adults and children when other treatments haven't been effective.  It's a short-term treatment option, typically used in hospital settings for acutely decompensated heart failure.  Amrinone's action involves improving the heart's ability to pump blood more efficiently.  It's sometimes considered a "rescue medication" when other therapies fail to adequately improve cardiac output and symptoms.  Importantly, it's usually not a long-term solution and is often part of a broader treatment plan.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The following dosage information is for general understanding only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosing based on individual patient needs and medical history. Amrinone is administered intravenously (IV).

**Adults:**

* **Loading Dose:** 0.75 mg/kg given as a rapid intravenous bolus over 2-3 minutes.
* **Maintenance Dose:**  5-10 mcg/kg/min as a continuous intravenous infusion. The maintenance dose may be adjusted based on the patient's response and tolerance.
* **Maximum Daily Dose:**  10 mg/kg/day.

**Children (including Neonates):**

Dosage varies considerably based on age and weight.  A physician will determine the exact dosage and frequency.  Generally, a loading dose is followed by a continuous infusion.  The use in newborns under 28 days old requires careful monitoring.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (creatinine clearance).  The physician will reduce the dose accordingly.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** While no specific dosage adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer for liver impairment, caution is advised.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients):**

* Fever
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Chest pain
* Pain or burning at the injection site
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)


If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.  This list isn't exhaustive, and other side effects are possible.


### How it Works

Amrinone works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3), an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP (cAMP).  Increased cAMP levels in heart muscle cells lead to stronger contractions (positive inotropic effect) and increased heart rate.  Additionally, Amrinone causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing the workload on the heart.  This combined effect improves the heart's ability to pump blood, increasing cardiac output and relieving symptoms of congestive heart failure.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Amrinone is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to amrinone, milrinone, or any component of the formulation.
* **Arrhythmias:** Amrinone can increase the risk of arrhythmias, especially in patients with pre-existing heart rhythm disorders. Careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Hypotension:** Amrinone can cause hypotension, particularly in patients already experiencing low blood pressure. Blood pressure should be closely monitored.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Liver function tests should be monitored regularly, particularly during long-term use.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are required in patients with kidney dysfunction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Amrinone can interact with other medications, including those affecting heart rhythm or blood pressure.  Inform your doctor of all medications you're taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amrinone is a Category C drug in pregnancy. Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh the risks. The excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other:** Amrinone may precipitate (form a solid) when mixed with certain intravenous solutions like dextrose and furosemide. It's crucial to follow proper mixing and administration guidelines.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Amrinone to work?**

A: The effects of amrinone are usually seen relatively quickly after administration, but the full therapeutic benefit may take some time to develop.

**Q: How is Amrinone stored?**

A:  Store as directed by your healthcare professional or the product label.

**Q: Can Amrinone be taken orally?**

A: No, Amrinone is only available as an intravenous (IV) injection.

**Q: Is Amrinone a long-term treatment for heart failure?**

A:  No, Amrinone is usually used for short-term management of acute decompensated heart failure in hospital settings. It's not typically prescribed for long-term maintenance.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of Amrinone?**

A: Amrinone is usually given by a healthcare professional in a controlled setting.  If you have any concerns, consult your physician immediately.  Never adjust the dosage or administration schedule on your own.
