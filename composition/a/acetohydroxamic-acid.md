# Acetohydroxamic Acid
### Generic Name
Acetohydroxamic Acid

### Usage
Acetohydroxamic acid is used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of chronic urea-splitting urinary tract infections.  It's crucial to understand that this medication doesn't cure the infection itself; instead, it works by inhibiting the activity of the urease enzyme produced by certain bacteria in the urinary tract.  These bacteria, through urease, break down urea into ammonia, making the urine more alkaline and potentially contributing to the formation of kidney stones and worsening the infection. By inhibiting urease, acetohydroxamic acid helps to lower urinary ammonia levels and reduce the alkalinity of the urine. This creates a more favorable environment for other antimicrobial medications to work effectively and helps prevent further stone formation.  Acetohydroxamic acid is not a first-line treatment and is always used in conjunction with other appropriate antibiotics and/or surgical interventions as determined by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For chronic urea-splitting urinary tract infections, the initial oral dose is typically 12 mg/kg/day, divided into doses given every 6-8 hours on an empty stomach. The maintenance dose is usually 250 mg three or four times a day (TID or QID), aiming for a total daily dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day.  However, the maximum daily dose should not exceed 1500 mg.

**Children and Adolescents:** In children and adolescents with chronic urea-splitting urinary tract infections, the initial oral dose is typically 10 mg/kg/day, divided into two or three doses.  The dose will be adjusted based on the individual child's response to treatment and the need to balance therapeutic effects with side effects.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment.  For individuals with serum creatinine levels above 1.8 mg/dL, a reduced dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours is recommended, with a maximum dose of 1000 mg/day.  Use is contraindicated if serum creatinine exceeds 2.5 mg/dL (or creatinine clearance is less than 20 mL/min).  No specific dosage adjustments are given for hepatic impairment in the manufacturer's labeling. If a reticulocyte count is over 6%, a dose reduction may be considered.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Malaise
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Nervousness
* Anorexia
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Hemolytic anemia
* Tremor


Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Deep vein thrombosis (rare)
* Embolism
* Flushing
* Palpitations
* Phlebitis
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Macular skin eruption
* Reticulocytosis

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Acetohydroxamic acid works by inhibiting the urease enzyme produced by certain bacteria that cause urinary tract infections.  Urease breaks down urea in the urine, producing ammonia, which increases the urine's pH (making it more alkaline). This alkaline environment promotes the formation of kidney stones and can impair the effectiveness of some antibiotics.  By blocking urease, acetohydroxamic acid reduces ammonia production, lowers the urine's pH, and creates a more favorable environment for the treatment of the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Acetohydroxamic acid is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, those whose condition is amenable to surgery or treatment with other antibiotics, urinary infections due to non-urease producing organisms, infections manageable with culture-specific oral antibiotics, poor renal function (serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance <20 mL/min), pregnant women, and women of childbearing age not using reliable contraception.
* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of hepatotoxicity, skin rash, bone marrow suppression, and hemolytic anemia.  Use with caution in patients with pre-existing bone marrow depression or anemia and those with renal impairment.  Avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with sodium picosulphate/magnesium hydroxide/anhydrous citric acid can decrease efficacy.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Acetohydroxamic acid is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it's contraindicated during pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; a decision should be made regarding breastfeeding or drug discontinuation, considering the mother's treatment needs.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store acetohydroxamic acid?** A: Store as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I take acetohydroxamic acid with other medications?** A:  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.

* **Q: How long does it take for acetohydroxamic acid to work?** A: The time it takes to see results depends on various factors, including the severity of the infection and individual response to treatment.  It is essential to follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding the duration of treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.  Consult your physician or pharmacist if you have questions.

* **Q: Is acetohydroxamic acid a cure for urinary tract infections?** A: No, acetohydroxamic acid is an adjunctive therapy. It helps control the infection by modifying the urinary environment but needs to be used in combination with other appropriate treatments.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking acetohydroxamic acid?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication as it could lead to adverse skin reactions.  Always consult your physician.
