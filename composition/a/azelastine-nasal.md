# Azelastine (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Azelastine (Nasal)

### Usage
Azelastine nasal spray is primarily used to treat the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), both seasonal and perennial.  This includes relieving symptoms such as runny nose (rhinorrhea), sneezing, and itchy nose (nasal pruritus). In some regions, it's also used to manage vasomotor rhinitis, a condition causing similar symptoms but not triggered by allergies.  The medication works locally within the nasal passages to address these symptoms directly at their source.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis:** 1-2 sprays of 0.1% solution (137 mcg/spray) or 0.15% solution (205.5 mcg/spray) in each nostril twice daily (BID), or 2 sprays of 0.15% solution in each nostril once daily (OD).
* **Perennial Allergic Rhinitis:** 2 sprays of 0.15% solution in each nostril BID.
* **Vasomotor Rhinitis:** 2 sprays of 0.1% solution in each nostril BID.

**Children:** Dosage varies significantly by age and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow a doctor's prescription and instructions.  Consult the provided prescribing information for precise pediatric dosages, which differ based on age (2-5 years, 6-11 years, 12 years and older) and the type of rhinitis.

**Administration:**  Azelastine is administered as a nasal spray.  Before initial use, and after three or more days of non-use, the spray should be primed according to the product instructions (typically involves several test sprays until a fine mist is produced).  Avoid spraying into the eyes.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache
* Bitter taste
* Somnolence (sleepiness)
* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages)
* Cold symptoms
* Cough

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (<10%):**  A wide range of less frequent side effects have been reported, including dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and various other symptoms affecting different body systems.  Some side effects may be related to the specific formulation or concentration of the drug.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Azelastine is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, triggering many of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Azelastine blocks histamine's action, thus reducing symptoms.  Additionally, it may also inhibit the release of other inflammatory mediators involved in allergic reactions, further contributing to symptom relief.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Currently, there are no absolute contraindications reported in standard manufacturer labeling.
* **Interactions:** Concurrent use with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., sedatives, alcohol) should be avoided due to the potential for additive sedative effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Azelastine falls into pregnancy category C (potential risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out). Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding requires careful consideration and consultation with a doctor.
* **Children:** Pediatric dosages are much lower than adult dosages and should only be administered under strict medical supervision.
* **Hazardous Activities:**  Because of potential drowsiness, avoid operating machinery or driving while using this medication.
* **Other Precautions:** Always inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.
