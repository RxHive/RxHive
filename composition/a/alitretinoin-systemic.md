# Alitretinoin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Alitretinoin (Systemic)

### Usage
Alitretinoin (systemic) is primarily used to treat severe, chronic hand eczema that hasn't responded adequately to high-potency topical corticosteroids.  This means it's reserved for cases of eczema that are particularly stubborn and haven't improved with other, less potent treatments.  It's a systemic treatment, meaning it's taken orally, rather than applied directly to the skin.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Eczema of the hand):**

* **Oral:** The starting dose is typically 30 mg once daily.  If side effects are intolerable, the doctor may reduce the dose to 10 mg once daily. The usual dosage range is between 10-30 mg once daily.
* **Treatment Duration:** Treatment generally lasts for 12-24 weeks.  The doctor may stop treatment earlier if the eczema clears or significantly improves before 24 weeks, or if there's no significant improvement after the initial 12 weeks.  Patients experiencing a relapse may benefit from additional courses, but women must adhere to the same contraceptive precautions used during the initial treatment.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of alitretinoin in children haven't been established.  It's not recommended for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Alitretinoin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is specifically recommended for mild-to-moderate renal (kidney) impairment, however, it's contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Toxicity Management:** If intolerable side effects develop, the dose may be reduced to 10 mg once daily.

### How it Works
Alitretinoin is a retinoid, a type of vitamin A derivative. It works by binding to both retinoid acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) in the body.  This interaction helps to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune response in the skin.  Specifically, it downregulates the expression of certain chemokines (signaling molecules that attract immune cells) and suppresses the expansion of inflammatory cells in the skin, thereby easing the symptoms of severe eczema.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Alitretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding women, individuals with hypersensitivity to alitretinoin or other retinoids, those with hepatic or severe renal impairment, uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, hypervitaminosis A, hereditary fructose intolerance, and those concurrently using tetracyclines.  Women of childbearing potential must meet strict pregnancy prevention program requirements before starting treatment.

* **Interactions:** Alitretinoin can interact with numerous medications, including some contraceptives, certain CYP enzyme inhibitors, and photosensitizing agents.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:** Alitretinoin is a known teratogen (causes birth defects).  Strict adherence to the pregnancy prevention program is mandatory for women of childbearing potential.  Regular monitoring of lipid profiles, liver function, and thyroid function is necessary.  Patients should be aware of the potential for increased risk of depression, mood changes, and other psychiatric effects.  Avoid excessive sun exposure and use sun protection.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The response to alitretinoin varies, but improvement may be seen within several weeks of starting treatment.  However, the full course of treatment should be completed as directed by your physician.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking alitretinoin?** A:  While there's no specific contraindication against alcohol consumption, excessive alcohol intake should be avoided due to the potential impact on liver function and the risk of interacting with other potential medications. Discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store alitretinoin?** A: Store alitretinoin as directed on the prescription label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I stop taking alitretinoin abruptly?** A: No, do not stop taking alitretinoin without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may lead to relapse or other complications.  Your doctor will help you gradually reduce the dose if necessary.

* **Q: What if I become pregnant while taking alitretinoin?** A: Stop taking alitretinoin immediately and contact your doctor.  Alitretinoin is a known teratogen, and its use during pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects.
