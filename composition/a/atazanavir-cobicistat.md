# Atazanavir + Cobicistat
### Generic Name
Atazanavir + Cobicistat

### Usage
Atazanavir + Cobicistat is a fixed-dose combination of two antiretroviral drugs used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children weighing at least 35 kg.  It's crucial to understand that this drug combination is always used *in conjunction* with other antiretroviral medications; it's not a standalone treatment.  The combination's primary purpose is to suppress HIV replication, thereby slowing the progression of the disease and improving the patient's overall health.  The choice to include this combination in a treatment regimen depends on factors like the patient's prior treatment history (treatment-naive or treatment-experienced) and the presence of any drug resistance mutations.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical adult dose is one tablet (containing 300 mg atazanavir and 150 mg cobicistat) taken once daily.  This must be administered with other antiretroviral agents as prescribed by a healthcare professional.  Dosage adjustments for the Atazanavir/Cobicistat combination are not possible; therefore, individual components cannot be titrated separately.  The decision to use this combination in treatment-experienced patients hinges on the number of baseline primary protease inhibitor resistance substitutions.  Renal and hepatic function tests are essential before starting and during treatment.

**Children and Adolescents:**  For children and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg, the dosage is also one tablet (300 mg atazanavir/150 mg cobicistat) once daily.  This combination is not recommended for children under 3 months due to the risk of kernicterus, and its safety and efficacy haven't been established in children under 35 kg.  Treatment decisions in pediatric patients also need to account for their individual genetic makeup, resistance patterns, and overall health.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with mild to severe renal impairment.  However, co-administration with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 70 mL/min or if they have recently received nephrotoxic agents.  Use is not recommended in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients requiring hemodialysis, especially if they are treatment-experienced.  Use is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Important Note:**  This list isn't exhaustive.  If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor.  It works by blocking the HIV protease enzyme, a crucial protein for the virus's replication.  By inhibiting the protease, atazanavir prevents the virus from producing mature, infectious viral particles.  Cobicistat is a CYP3A inhibitor; it boosts atazanavir's levels in the bloodstream by preventing its breakdown in the liver, thus enhancing its effectiveness.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Atazanavir + Cobicistat is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to atazanavir, cobicistat, or any component of the formulation, particularly those with a history of significant reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  It's also contraindicated with several other medications due to potential for harmful drug interactions.  Consult prescribing information for a complete list of contraindicated drugs.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination interacts extensively with many other medications, including antifungals, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers,  antibiotics, and many others.  Concurrent use with certain drugs can lead to dangerously increased levels of either atazanavir, cobicistat, or the interacting drug, or dangerously decreased levels of atazanavir or cobicistat, reducing its effectiveness and increasing the risk of developing HIV resistance.  Therefore, thorough review of all medications a patient takes is crucial before starting Atazanavir + Cobicistat.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Atazanavir + Cobicistat is not recommended during pregnancy and should not be initiated in pregnant individuals.  Alternative regimens are suggested if pregnancy occurs during therapy.  Atazanavir is excreted in breast milk, and the safety of cobicistat in breast milk is unknown; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended for HIV-1 infected mothers.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Caution is needed in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should be monitored for potential side effects, including those related to the kidneys, liver, and heart.  Maintaining adequate hydration is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Atazanavir + Cobicistat with other medications?** A:  It's extremely important to discuss all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies with your doctor before starting Atazanavir + Cobicistat. Many drugs interact significantly with this combination, requiring careful monitoring or dosage adjustments.
* **Q: How should I store Atazanavir + Cobicistat?** A: Store the tablets as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance on how to proceed if you miss a dose. Do not double the next dose.
* **Q: Is Atazanavir + Cobicistat a cure for HIV?** A: No, it is not a cure for HIV. It's an antiretroviral therapy to suppress the virus and prevent it from replicating.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking Atazanavir + Cobicistat?** A: Long-term use may be associated with various side effects, including renal and hepatic dysfunction. Regular monitoring of these parameters is therefore needed.  Consult your healthcare provider for more information and guidance on long-term management.
