# Adenosine
### Generic Name
Adenosine

### Usage

Adenosine is primarily used to convert paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to normal sinus rhythm.  PSVT is a type of rapid heartbeat originating from above the ventricles (lower chambers) of the heart. Adenosine's rapid action temporarily blocks the electrical signals causing the abnormal rhythm, allowing the heart to revert to its normal rhythm.

Adenosine also has a role as an adjunct in pharmacologic stress testing, specifically myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (thallium stress test). In this context, it's used for patients who cannot adequately exercise during the test.  Adenosine causes coronary vasodilation, improving blood flow in healthy arteries while minimally affecting narrowed arteries. This difference in blood flow helps visualize areas of reduced blood supply within the heart muscle. Note that these are the primary and most common uses; other applications exist but are often considered off-label uses.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):**  6 mg rapid intravenous (IV) bolus over 1–2 seconds via a peripheral line. If ineffective within 1–2 minutes, a 12 mg bolus may be given; this dose may be repeated if necessary. The maximum single dose is 12 mg.  Each dose should be followed by a 20 mL normal saline flush.

* **Pharmacologic Stress Testing:** 140 mcg/kg/min continuous IV infusion for 6 minutes via a peripheral line using a syringe pump. Thallium-201 is injected at the 3-minute mark.

* **Off-label uses (require careful consideration and monitoring by a physician):** Dosages vary considerably for off-label uses such as acute vasodilator testing in pulmonary artery hypertension or fractional flow reserve testing, and are highly dependent on the specific clinical context and patient factors.  These should only be administered under close medical supervision by a specialist.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

Dosage for PSVT in children varies greatly based on weight and is generally calculated as 0.05-0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 6mg in smaller children, with increments if needed and a maximum of 0.3 mg/kg or 12 mg, whichever is less.  For children over 50 kg, adult dosing may be used.  There are alternative dosing strategies recommended in some guidelines (e.g., PALS 2010), which clinicians should reference for precise protocols. Always follow a physician’s specific instructions for pediatric administration.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Adenosine works by activating adenosine receptors in the heart, primarily A1 receptors. This activation slows the conduction of electrical impulses through the atrioventricular (AV) node – a crucial component of the heart's electrical system.  In PSVT, this interruption of abnormal electrical signals allows the heart to resume its normal rhythm.  In stress testing, its vasodilatory effect reveals areas of compromised blood flow.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Adenosine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to adenosine, second- or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome (unless they have a pacemaker), or significant bronchospastic lung disease (including asthma).

* **Interactions:** Adenosine's effects can be altered by several drugs, including caffeine, carbamazepine, digoxin, dipyridamole, nicotine, and theophylline. These interactions may increase side effects or reduce adenosine's effectiveness.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Adenosine carries risks of serious cardiovascular events, such as asystole, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and cardiac arrest.  Careful monitoring, especially ECG monitoring, is essential during and after administration. Use with extreme caution in patients with heart failure, heart transplant, or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Adenosine is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The effects on a developing fetus are unknown.  The decision to use adenosine during pregnancy should be made carefully, weighing the benefits against the potential risks.  It's also unknown if adenosine is excreted in breast milk.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does adenosine take to work?** A:  The effects of adenosine are usually rapid, typically within 1-2 minutes for PSVT.

* **Q: How is adenosine administered?** A: Adenosine is usually administered intravenously (IV) as a rapid bolus.

* **Q: How is adenosine stored?** A: Store adenosine according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature, protected from light.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of adenosine?** A: Adenosine's effects are generally short-lived.  There aren't usually any long-term effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your healthcare provider immediately.
