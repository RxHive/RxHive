# Alcaftadine
### Generic Name
Alcaftadine

### Usage
Alcaftadine is primarily used to prevent itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the sclera—the white part of the eye—caused by an allergic reaction).  It effectively targets the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, offering relief from the discomfort and irritation.

### Dosage
**Allergic Conjunctivitis:**

* **Adults and Children ≥2 years:** The typical dose is one drop of 0.25% alcaftadine ophthalmic solution in each affected eye once daily.

* **Children <2 years:** The safety and efficacy of alcaftadine have not been established in children under 2 years old.  This medication should not be used in this age group.


**Administration:**  The medication is administered as eye drops.  To avoid contamination, do not touch the dropper tip to any surface, including the eyelids. If using other eye drops, administer them at least 5 minutes apart.  Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Eye irritation (burning, stinging)
* Eye redness
* Eye itching
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Headache

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Allergic dermatitis (skin inflammation)
* Blurred vision
* Drowsiness
* Erythema (redness) of the eyelid
* Eye discharge
* Eyelid edema (swelling)
* Facial edema (swelling)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Increased lacrimation (tearing)
* Swelling of the eye

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the less common ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Alcaftadine is an H1-receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing the itching and inflammation associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Alcaftadine blocks the action of histamine at its receptor sites, reducing the allergic response and therefore alleviating itching.  Additionally, it may also decrease the movement of immune cells (chemotaxis) and inhibit eosinophil (a type of white blood cell) activation, further reducing inflammation.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Alcaftadine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to alcaftadine or any components of the formulation.
* **Interactions:** Concurrent use with bupropion or donepezil may lower the seizure threshold.  Consult your doctor if you are taking these medications.
* **Contact Lens Wearers:** Exercise caution when using alcaftadine if you wear contact lenses.  Remove contact lenses before administration and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them. Avoid using alcaftadine if eye redness is present.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Alcaftadine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B. While studies in animals have not shown harm, the safety in pregnant women has not been fully established.  Use caution during pregnancy. It's unknown if alcaftadine is excreted in breast milk; use caution while breastfeeding.
* **General Precautions:**  This medication is for topical ophthalmic (eye) use only. Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface.
