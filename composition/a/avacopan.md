# Avacopan
### Generic Name
Avacopan

### Usage
Avacopan is a medication used as an adjunctive therapy in adults with severe, active ANCA-associated vasculitis (specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA] and microscopic polyangiitis [MPA]).  This means it's used *in addition to* standard treatments, primarily glucocorticoids (steroids), to help manage this serious autoimmune disease.  ANCA-associated vasculitis causes inflammation of blood vessels, potentially leading to organ damage.  Avacopan's role is to help control this inflammation and improve the overall disease management.  It is crucial to understand that Avacopan does not replace the need for glucocorticoids.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The usual dose is 30 mg twice daily (BID) orally. This is taken in conjunction with other standard treatments prescribed by a physician.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Avacopan in children haven't been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh A or B), no dosage adjustment is typically needed. However, Avacopan is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).  Liver function tests should be monitored.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate, or severe kidney impairment.
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  If a patient is taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (medications that interfere with the metabolism of Avacopan), the Avacopan dose should be reduced to 30 mg once daily (OD).  This is because strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the levels of Avacopan in the body.

**Administration:** Avacopan is given orally in capsule form.  Capsules should be swallowed whole; they should not be crushed, chewed, or opened.  It's recommended to take Avacopan with food.

### Side Effects
**Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Rash
* Liver-related adverse reactions (including elevated liver enzymes)
* Fatigue

**Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Upper abdominal pain
* Increased blood creatinine levels (indicating potential kidney problems)
* Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels (indicating potential muscle damage)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)

**Important Note:** This list isn't exhaustive. If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Avacopan works by blocking the C5a receptor (C5aR).  C5a is a protein involved in the body's inflammatory response.  In ANCA-associated vasculitis, the inflammatory response is overly active and damaging. By blocking the C5aR, Avacopan inhibits the action of C5a, reducing neutrophil activation and migration. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a significant role in inflammation.  By lessening the activity of neutrophils, Avacopan helps to reduce the inflammation associated with ANCA-associated vasculitis.  The exact mechanism of how this leads to therapeutic benefits in these patients is still being fully understood.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Avacopan is contraindicated in patients with a known serious hypersensitivity to Avacopan or any of its components.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Avacopan can cause liver damage.  Liver function tests should be monitored before and during treatment.
* **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation:** Avacopan may increase the risk of HBV reactivation.  Patients should be screened for HBV infection before starting Avacopan.
* **Interactions:** Avacopan interacts with certain other medications, particularly those that affect the CYP3A4 enzyme system.  Avoid concurrent use with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers.  Reduce the Avacopan dose if used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of Avacopan during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.
* **Infections:** Avacopan may increase the risk of serious infections.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Avacopan if I feel better?** A: No, do not stop taking Avacopan without first consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly could worsen your condition.  Your doctor will determine when and how to adjust or discontinue your medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How should I store Avacopan?** A: Store Avacopan at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Avacopan?** A: It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.  Alcohol may interact with some medications or worsen existing conditions.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Avacopan?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied. Regular monitoring and communication with your doctor are essential.
