# Angiotensin II
### Generic Name
Angiotensin II

### Usage
Angiotensin II is primarily used to treat hypotension (low blood pressure) in adults experiencing septic shock or other forms of distributive shock.  Distributive shock is a condition where blood vessels widen, leading to a significant drop in blood pressure. Septic shock is a severe type of distributive shock caused by an overwhelming infection.  Angiotensin II's role is to raise blood pressure by constricting blood vessels, improving blood flow to vital organs.  It's a critical treatment option in these life-threatening situations when other measures haven't been effective.  Note that Angiotensin II is not a first-line treatment for these conditions.


### Dosage
Angiotensin II is administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion.  Dosage is highly individualized and determined by the patient's response to the medication.

**Adults (Hypotension):**

* **Initial Dose:**  The initial infusion rate is typically 20 ng/kg/min.
* **Titration:** Blood pressure must be closely monitored, and the infusion rate is adjusted in increments of up to 15 ng/kg/min every 5 minutes, as needed, to reach and maintain the target blood pressure.  The rate should not exceed 40 ng/kg/min.  A maximum initial dose of 80 ng/kg/min might be used during the first 3 hours of treatment.
* **Maintenance:** Once the patient's condition improves, the infusion rate should be gradually reduced in decrements of up to 15 ng/kg/min every 5-15 minutes, depending on blood pressure response.
* **Administration:** Administration through a central venous line is recommended.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Angiotensin II in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Angiotensin II can cause several side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  Always consult a doctor if you experience any adverse effects.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Delirium
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Deep vein thrombosis
* Peripheral ischemia (reduced blood flow to the limbs)
* Acidosis (increased acidity in the blood)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Fungal infections


### How it Works
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor. It works by binding to angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) receptors located on the smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls. This binding triggers a series of events that ultimately lead to the contraction of these muscles, narrowing the blood vessels and increasing blood pressure.  Additionally, it stimulates the release of aldosterone, a hormone that promotes sodium and water retention, further contributing to increased blood volume and blood pressure.


### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with ACE inhibitors might increase the response to Angiotensin II, while use with ARBs may decrease the response.
* **Thrombosis Risk:** Angiotensin II increases the risk of thrombosis (blood clot formation).  Prophylactic measures against venous thromboembolism (VTE) should be considered.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Angiotensin II during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  The decision to use it in pregnant women should be made carefully, weighing the benefits against the potential risks to both mother and fetus.  Delaying treatment due to pregnancy can significantly increase maternal and fetal risks in cases of septic or other distributive shock.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Other Precautions:** Close monitoring of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation) is crucial during Angiotensin II administration.  Patients should be assessed for effectiveness of treatment (normotensive blood pressure) and monitored for symptoms of thrombosis (such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain/swelling).

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Angiotensin II administered?** A: It's given intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects of Angiotensin II are typically seen relatively quickly, though the precise timeframe varies depending on the dose and individual response.
* **Q: How is it stored?** A: Vials should be stored refrigerated (2-8Â°C).  Diluted solutions should be discarded after 24 hours at room temperature or under refrigeration.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.
* **Q: Is Angiotensin II a long-term treatment?** A:  No, it's typically used for short-term management of acute hypotensive episodes, not for chronic blood pressure control.
