# Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free
### Generic Name
Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free

### Usage

Antihemophilic factor (recombinant) plasma/albumin-free is a medication used to treat Hemophilia A.  This is a genetic disorder where the blood doesn't clot properly due to a deficiency or absence of Factor VIII, a crucial clotting protein.  The medication's primary use is to control and prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with Hemophilia A, both in adults and children (0-16 years).  It's also used for perioperative management (before, during, and after surgery) in these patients and for routine prophylaxis (preventative treatment) to reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes.  Importantly, this medication is *not* indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand disease.


### Dosage

Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's weight, age, the severity and type of bleeding episode, and their individual response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following is a summary and should not replace individualized guidance:

**Dosage Calculation:** The expected increase in Factor VIII levels can be estimated using formulas provided by the healthcare provider.  These formulas consider body weight and the desired Factor VIII rise.

**Adults and Children (0-16 years):**

* **Control and Prevention of Bleeding Episodes:** The dose and frequency depend on the severity of the bleed (minor, moderate, or major).  Dosage ranges from 10-50 IU/kg, administered intravenously (IV), with repeat infusions every 8-24 hours, depending on response and severity.  Children under 6 may require more frequent infusions.

* **Perioperative Management:** Dosage varies depending on whether the procedure is minor (e.g., tooth extraction) or major (e.g., joint replacement surgery).  For minor procedures, a single dose of 30-50 IU/kg is given pre-procedure. Major procedures might require higher doses (40-60 IU/kg) before and after surgery, with repeat doses every 8-24 hours, based on the need to maintain Factor VIII levels and the healing process.

* **Routine Prophylaxis:**  Doses typically range between 20-40 IU/kg of Factor VIII, administered every other day or every third day, to maintain a sufficient Factor VIII level.  The specific schedule and dose are determined to minimize bleeding episodes.


**Important Considerations:** Always administer this medication intravenously, as directed by a medical professional.  The medication is reconstituted before administration, and there are specific instructions for this process.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (can occur in more than 10% of patients) can include:  pyrexia (fever), headache, cough, nasopharyngitis (common cold), vomiting, arthralgia (joint pain), and limb injury.

Less common, but serious side effects include hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) potentially including anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction), and the development of high-titer inhibitors (the body develops antibodies against the medication).  

If any adverse effects occur, especially allergic reactions, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Antihemophilic factor (recombinant) plasma/albumin-free works by temporarily replacing the missing Factor VIII in individuals with Hemophilia A.  Factor VIII is a crucial part of the clotting cascade, a series of reactions that lead to blood clot formation. By providing this missing clotting factor, the medication helps the blood clot effectively, preventing or controlling bleeding episodes.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with known anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) to mouse or hamster protein or other components of the formulation.

* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and the development of Factor VIII inhibitors.

* **Use with Caution:**  Use caution in breastfeeding women. The medication's excretion in breast milk is unknown.

* **Other Medications:**  Currently, no significant drug interactions are documented, but always inform your doctor of all medications you're taking.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** This medication is category C during pregnancy.  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the mother and child.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is this medication stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately for guidance on missed doses.  Do not attempt to double up on doses.

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the individual's condition and response to the medication. Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate course of treatment.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions?** A:  Generally, there are no specific dietary restrictions associated with this medication. However, consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns.
