# Alosetron
### Generic Name
Alosetron

### Usage
Alosetron is a prescription medication exclusively for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who haven't responded well to other treatments.  It's a highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks the action of serotonin at specific receptors in the gut.  This helps to reduce the symptoms associated with IBS, primarily diarrhea.  It is **not** a first-line treatment for IBS and is reserved for cases where other options have proven ineffective.

### Dosage
**Adults (Females only):** Alosetron is administered orally. The usual starting dose is 0.5 mg twice daily (BID) for four weeks.  If this dose is tolerated but symptoms aren't adequately controlled, the doctor may increase it to 1 mg BID (maximum daily dose of 2 mg).  Treatment should be stopped after four weeks if there's no significant improvement in symptoms at the 1 mg BID dose.  If constipation occurs at 0.5 mg BID, the medication should be stopped until the constipation resolves.  Treatment may then be restarted at 0.5 mg once daily, but it should be stopped immediately if constipation recurs.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of alosetron in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dose adjustments are provided for mild-to-moderate renal impairment.  For mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, use caution.  Alosetron is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects
**Common (>10%):**

*   Constipation

**Less Common (1-10%):**

*   Fatigue
*   Headache
*   Abdominal distress/pain
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Flatulence
*   Urinary tract infection
*   Muscle spasms
*   Cough
*   Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
*   Upper respiratory tract infection

**Rare (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**  Many rare side effects have been reported.  These include but are not limited to ischemic colitis (inflammation of the colon due to reduced blood flow), intestinal obstruction, severe constipation, and other serious gastrointestinal complications.  Some cases have resulted in hospitalization, surgery, and, rarely, death.  This risk is serious and requires careful monitoring.


### How it Works
Alosetron works by blocking serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter involved in gut motility (movement). By blocking these receptors, alosetron reduces the signals that cause increased bowel movements and diarrhea, thus alleviating the symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Alosetron is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

*   Constipation (current or history of chronic/severe)
*   History of ischemic colitis, intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, GI perforation, adhesions, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis
*   Severe hepatic impairment
*   Impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state
*   Concomitant use with strong to moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine)

**Warnings:** Alosetron carries a boxed warning due to the risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events, including ischemic colitis and serious complications of constipation.  These complications can be life-threatening. Close monitoring for constipation and symptoms of ischemic colitis (severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea) is crucial.  The medication must be stopped immediately if these symptoms occur.

**Interactions:**  Alosetron interacts with certain medications that affect the liver's metabolism of drugs.  Use caution with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  Concomitant use with strong to moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated.

**Specific Populations:**  Use caution in elderly, debilitated patients, and those with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.  Pregnancy category B; the decision to breastfeed while taking alosetron needs careful consideration due to unknown excretion in breast milk.  Infants should be monitored for constipation or blood in stools.
