# Ambroxol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines the actions of three different active ingredients:

* **Ambroxol:**  A mucolytic agent that helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. This helps to relieve congestion and make breathing easier.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine that helps to reduce the symptoms of allergies, such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes. It also has some drying effect on nasal secretions.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that helps to reduce or suppress a cough.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but can include:

* **Common:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, upset stomach.
* **Less Common:** Headache, blurred vision, nervousness, insomnia, urinary retention.
* **Rare (but serious):** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), rapid heartbeat, seizures.


**How it Works:** The combination works synergistically to address multiple symptoms of respiratory illnesses.

* **Ambroxol:**  Increases the secretion of fluid into the airways, thus reducing the viscosity of the mucus and facilitating its expulsion.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released during allergic reactions. This helps to reduce inflammation and the associated symptoms.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:**  Acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex.
