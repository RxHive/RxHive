# Ammonium Chloride
### Generic Name
Ammonium Chloride

### Usage

Ammonium Chloride is primarily used to treat metabolic alkalosis, a condition where the body's blood is too alkaline (has a high pH).  This often results from excessive vomiting or loss of stomach acid.  Ammonium chloride works by providing chloride ions, helping to restore the body's acid-base balance. It's also used to treat hypochloremic states, where the body has a deficiency of chloride ions.  In addition to its intravenous use in these conditions, ammonium chloride is sometimes found in cough syrups as an expectorant.  As an expectorant, it helps to loosen and thin mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up.  It achieves this by irritating the bronchial mucosa, which stimulates increased mucus production.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

The dosage of ammonium chloride varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the individual's specific needs.  For intravenous treatment of hypochloremic states and metabolic alkalosis, the dose is calculated based on either the chloride deficit or bicarbonate excess using complex formulas involving body weight, serum chloride levels, and serum bicarbonate levels.  These calculations are best performed by a healthcare professional.  The calculated dose is typically administered over 12-24 hours, often split into two administrations.  

For oral use as an expectorant in cough syrups, the typical dose is 250-500 mg twice daily (BID), though this can be adjusted depending on the severity of symptoms and the physician's instructions.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Ammonium chloride is less commonly used in children for metabolic alkalosis, often replaced by other treatments.  If it's used, the dosage is also calculated based on complex formulas taking into account the child's weight, and serum chloride/bicarbonate levels.  These calculations must be performed by a physician.   For oral use as an expectorant, the usual dose is 10mg/kg three times daily (TID).

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function.  Generally, ammonium chloride is contraindicated in cases of severe hepatic or renal impairment. Always consult a physician for appropriate dosing instructions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Gastric irritation

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Metabolic acidosis
* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Hyperchloremia (high chloride levels)
* Seizures
* Coma
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching)

If any adverse effects occur, seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works

In treating metabolic alkalosis, ammonium chloride acts as an acidifying agent.  Once administered, the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) is metabolized in the liver, releasing hydrogen ions (H⁺) which lower the blood pH. The chloride ion (Cl⁻) helps to restore the body's electrolyte balance.

As an expectorant, ammonium chloride's mechanism involves direct irritation of the bronchial mucosa, increasing mucus production. This increased mucus secretion helps to facilitate the removal of phlegm from the airways.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Severe hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Metabolic alkalosis accompanied by sodium loss (sodium bicarbonate excretion in urine).
* **Interactions:** Ammonium chloride can interact with other medications; discuss all medications and supplements you are taking with your physician or pharmacist.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with primary respiratory acidosis or pulmonary insufficiency, and in those with cardiac edema.  Monitor patients closely for signs of ammonia toxicity.  Ammonium chloride should be administered slowly intravenously to minimize adverse effects.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ammonium chloride falls under pregnancy category C; it is not known whether it can harm a fetus. Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using this medication.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to the side effects of ammonium chloride due to potential age-related changes in liver and kidney function; careful monitoring is essential.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store ammonium chloride?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I take ammonium chloride with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you take before starting ammonium chloride to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose of oral ammonium chloride, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose. For intravenous administration, a missed dose should be addressed with your physician.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects associated with ammonium chloride?**  A:  Long-term use of ammonium chloride can potentially lead to issues such as acid-base imbalances and electrolyte disturbances, making ongoing monitoring by a healthcare professional vital.

* **Q: Is ammonium chloride habit-forming?** A: No, ammonium chloride is not considered a habit-forming drug.
