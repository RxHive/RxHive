# Acalabrutinib
### Generic Name
Acalabrutinib

### Usage
Acalabrutinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat certain types of blood cancers. Its main applications are in:

* **Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL):**  Acalabrutinib is used for adult patients with MCL who have already received at least one other treatment.  It helps to control the progression of the disease.

* **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL):** Acalabrutinib is approved for adults with CLL or SLL. It can be used as a single agent or in combination with other medications, depending on the patient's condition and treatment history.  In some cases, it's used for patients who haven't received prior treatment, while in others, it's a later-line therapy option.


### Dosage

Dosage for acalabrutinib varies depending on the specific condition being treated and whether it is used as a single agent or in combination with other therapies.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The typical dosage is:

* **Adults (MCL and CLL/SLL):**  100 mg taken orally twice daily (approximately every 12 hours). The treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.  In combination therapy with obinutuzumab for previously untreated CLL/SLL, the dosage remains the same, starting in Cycle 1, with obinutuzumab starting in Cycle 2.


* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of acalabrutinib in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage may need adjustment based on factors like liver or kidney function.  Individuals with severe liver impairment should generally avoid acalabrutinib.  While no specific adjustments are detailed in the manufacturer's labeling for those with mild-to-moderate liver impairment or kidney impairment, your doctor will carefully monitor you.  Dose modifications may also be necessary if significant side effects develop.

If you experience any concerning side effects, it's crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Acalabrutinib is a type of medication called a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. BTK is a protein involved in the signaling pathways that control the growth and survival of certain immune cells, including B cells.  Many blood cancers involve abnormal B cells.  Acalabrutinib works by binding to and blocking the activity of BTK, thereby inhibiting the growth and survival of cancerous B cells and helping to control the progression of the disease.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Acalabrutinib is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components.

* **Infections:**  Acalabrutinib can increase the risk of serious infections.  Those with weakened immune systems should be closely monitored.

* **Bleeding:** There's an increased risk of bleeding, especially in individuals taking other medications that affect blood clotting.

* **Heart Rhythm:**  Acalabrutinib can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter.

* **Second Cancers:** There's an increased risk of developing additional cancers.

* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Acalabrutinib may need dose adjustment for those with impaired liver or kidney function.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Acalabrutinib can harm a developing fetus and is not recommended during pregnancy.  Women should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least a week after the final dose. Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for at least two weeks after the final dose.
