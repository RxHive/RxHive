**How it Works:** Acalabrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.  BTK is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the survival and growth of certain types of cancer cells, particularly those involved in B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.  By inhibiting BTK, acalabrutinib helps to prevent the cancer cells from proliferating and ultimately leads to their death.
