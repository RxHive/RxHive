# Azlocillin
### Generic Name
Azlocillin

### Usage
Azlocillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic primarily used to treat serious bacterial infections caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.  This bacterium is known for its resistance to many common antibiotics, making azlocillin a valuable treatment option in cases where other drugs have failed.  Beyond *P. aeruginosa* infections, azlocillin is also effective against a range of other gram-negative bacteria.  Its common applications include treating infections of the respiratory tract (pneumonia, bronchitis), urinary tract (cystitis, pyelonephritis), bloodstream (septicemia), and abdomen (peritonitis).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Azlocillin is administered intravenously (IV). The typical dosage is 2 grams every 8 hours. For life-threatening infections, this may be increased to 5 grams every 8 hours. Treatment duration usually lasts 10-14 days, but this can vary based on the severity of the infection and the patient's response.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is calculated based on weight and age.  It is crucial to follow the prescribing healthcare provider's instructions carefully.  Generally,  doses range from 50 mg/kg twice daily (BID) for premature infants to 100 mg/kg twice daily for neonates older than 7 days, and up to 75 mg/kg three times daily (TID) for older children.  Precise dosing should always be determined by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal and hepatic impairment significantly affect azlocillin's elimination.  Patients with moderate-to-severe kidney problems (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) may require longer dosing intervals (every 12 hours) or reduced doses. Those undergoing dialysis need special dosage adjustments; usually, a 3-gram dose is given after each dialysis session, followed by doses every 12 hours.  Dose reduction might be necessary for patients with severe liver disease.

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Diarrhea is a frequent side effect, and antibiotic-associated colitis (inflammation of the colon) can occur, though less frequently.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Azlocillin can affect blood clotting, potentially leading to bleeding disorders (purpura, hemorrhage).  Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) ranging from mild rashes and itching (urticaria) to severe life-threatening anaphylaxis can occur.  Other potential side effects include:
    * Nervous system problems (convulsions, CNS toxicity)
    * Electrolyte imbalances
    * Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
    * Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
    * Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
    * Interstitial nephritis (kidney inflammation)
    * Pain and inflammation at the injection site (phlebitis)
    * Serum sickness-like reaction

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Azlocillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) within the bacterial cell, preventing the final stages of cell wall construction.  This disruption weakens the bacterial cell, leading to its death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Azlocillin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to penicillins or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with aminoglycoside antibiotics may reduce the efficacy of the aminoglycoside. Combining azlocillin with certain seizure medications increases the risk of seizures.  Simultaneous use with ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides increases the risk of adverse effects.  The typhoid vaccine's effectiveness may be reduced if administered concurrently with azlocillin.
* **Warnings:** Prolonged use of azlocillin can lead to the growth of resistant bacteria (suprainfection).  Patients with renal impairment or heart failure should be monitored closely, especially when high doses are administered, due to the risk of neurotoxicity.  Use caution in patients on sodium-restricted diets as azlocillin formulations may contain sodium.  Pregnancy (Category B) and breastfeeding require careful consideration and consultation with a healthcare provider.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is azlocillin administered?** A: Azlocillin is administered intravenously, either by slow injection or infusion.

* **Q: How long does azlocillin treatment usually last?** A: Treatment duration varies from 10-14 days depending on the infection and the patientâ€™s response.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe allergic reactions.

* **Q: Can I take azlocillin with other medications?** A: It is important to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store azlocillin?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by the pharmacist or on the medication label.  Generally, it should be stored at a controlled room temperature.
