# Amprenavir
### Generic Name
Amprenavir

### Usage
Amprenavir is an antiretroviral medication primarily used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's not a cure for HIV, but it's a crucial part of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), significantly slowing the progression of the disease and improving the quality of life for those infected. Amprenavir works by inhibiting the HIV-1 protease enzyme, a vital protein for the virus's replication. By blocking this enzyme, amprenavir prevents the virus from producing infectious viral particles, thereby reducing the viral load in the body.  It is always used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, never as a monotherapy.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (HIV-1 Infection):**

* **Oral Capsules:** 1200 mg twice daily (BID) in combination with other antiretroviral medications.
* **Oral Solution (15 mg/mL):** 1400 mg BID, usually in combination with another protease inhibitor.  Switching to capsules is preferred if tolerated.

**Pediatric Dosage (HIV-1 Infection):**

Dosage is weight-based and depends on the child's age and overall health.  Always follow the precise instructions given by a healthcare professional.  Generally:

* **Children >4 years, weighing <50 kg:** Capsules: 20 mg/kg BID or 15 mg/kg three times daily (TID), up to a maximum daily dose of 2400 mg.  Solution: 22.5 mg/kg BID or 17 mg/kg TID, up to a maximum daily dose of 2800 mg.
* **Children >13 years, weighing >50 kg:**  Dosages are similar to adults – 1200 mg capsules BID or 1400 mg solution BID.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  The specific adjustment will depend on the severity of the liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh score), and should always be determined by a physician. Use in patients with renal (kidney) impairment is not established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea/loose stools
* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Paresthesias (numbness or tingling)
* Fatigue
* Depression and mood disorders
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) – a rare but severe skin reaction requiring immediate medical attention.
* Acute hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
*  Metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis (especially in individuals with pre-existing diabetes)
* Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult a healthcare provider immediately if any concerning side effects occur.

### How it Works

Amprenavir is a protease inhibitor.  HIV-1 protease is an enzyme essential for the virus to replicate. Amprenavir works by binding to the active site of this enzyme, preventing it from properly cleaving the viral polyproteins. This results in immature, non-infectious viral particles, reducing the viral load and slowing the progression of HIV.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amprenavir is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of its components. It should be avoided in patients concurrently taking certain medications that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (a liver enzyme).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Amprenavir interacts with many other medications.  It can increase the blood levels of some drugs, leading to increased side effects.  Examples include certain benzodiazepines (like diazepam),  rifabutin,  cilostazol, and others. It can also affect the effectiveness of certain drugs such as warfarin. Always inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amprenavir is a Category C drug during pregnancy. Use should be carefully considered and only in consultation with a doctor. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding is generally discouraged to avoid postnatal transmission of HIV.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Amprenavir is primarily metabolized by the liver; thus, individuals with liver problems may require dosage adjustments or may not be suitable candidates for this medication.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Amprenavir should be used with caution in patients who consume excessive alcohol.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor for signs of SJS, hyperglycemia, and other potential adverse effects.  Regular monitoring of viral load and CD4 count is crucial while on amprenavir.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take amprenavir with food?** A: Amprenavir can be taken with or without food, but avoid high-fat meals, as they can significantly reduce absorption.

* **Q: How should I store amprenavir?** A: Store amprenavir as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.

* **Q:  Can amprenavir cure HIV?** A: No, amprenavir is not a cure for HIV. It’s a crucial part of a combination therapy to manage the virus and improve quality of life.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of amprenavir?** A:  Long-term use of amprenavir can be associated with several metabolic changes, including changes in lipid profiles and glucose metabolism. Regular monitoring by a physician is essential.
