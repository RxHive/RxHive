# Ambrisentan + Tadalafil
### Generic Name
Ambrisentan + Tadalafil (Combination Therapy – Not a Single Generic Drug)

**Important Note:**  Ambrisentan and Tadalafil are not typically combined into a single generic drug product.  They are often prescribed together, but as separate medications. The information below discusses each drug individually and then addresses their combined use.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions precisely.


### Usage

**Ambrisentan:**  Ambrisentan is a selective endothelin receptor antagonist. Its primary use is to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a serious condition where blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs becomes abnormally high.  It helps to relax and widen these blood vessels, improving blood flow to the lungs.

**Tadalafil:** Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor. Its primary use is to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. It works by increasing blood flow to the penis.  Tadalafil is also approved to treat pulmonary hypertension (though a different type than PAH, often termed pulmonary vascular disease) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an enlarged prostate gland.  In the context of PAH, it also helps improve blood flow in the pulmonary arteries.

**Combined Use:**  The combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil is sometimes used in patients with PAH to potentially offer a more comprehensive approach to managing the disease by targeting different mechanisms of vascular constriction. This combined therapy often aims to improve exercise capacity and reduce symptoms.  The prescribing physician will determine if this combination is appropriate based on individual patient needs and response to therapy.


### Dosage

**Ambrisentan:** The usual starting dose for adults is 5 mg once daily orally. The dose may be increased to 10 mg daily, based on individual tolerance and response.  There is no specific pediatric formulation.

**Tadalafil:** The dosage for tadalafil varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and individual factors. For pulmonary hypertension, the dosage is typically established through titration under the care of a physician. For erectile dysfunction, the typical starting dose is 10mg, as needed.  Doses can range from 2.5mg to 20mg. Pediatric use is not typically indicated for this indication.  There is no oral pediatric dosage available for pulmonary hypertension.  An IV formulation for either drug is not currently available.


**Combined Therapy Dosage:**  The dosages of ambrisentan and tadalafil used together must be determined and monitored by a physician. It is NOT a case of simply adding the dosages together.  The physician will tailor the dosage of each drug based on the patient's response and tolerance.



### Side Effects

**Ambrisentan:**

* Common: Headache, peripheral edema (swelling), nausea, dizziness, flushing.
* Less Common, but Serious:  Liver problems (hepatotoxicity),  low blood pressure (hypotension).

**Tadalafil:**

* Common: Headache, flushing, nasal congestion, dyspepsia (indigestion), back pain, muscle aches.
* Less Common, but Serious:  Sudden decrease or loss of vision, sudden decrease or loss of hearing, prolonged erection (priapism), heart attack, stroke.


**Combined Therapy Side Effects:** The side effects of the combined therapy can include those listed for each individual drug.  The physician should carefully monitor for any new or worsening side effects.


### How it Works

**Ambrisentan:**  Blocks the binding of endothelin-1 (a potent vasoconstrictor) to its receptors, which leads to relaxation and widening of blood vessels in the lungs, improving blood flow.

**Tadalafil:**  Inhibits PDE5, leading to increased levels of cyclic GMP (cGMP), a molecule that relaxes smooth muscle cells in the blood vessels. This improves blood flow, particularly in the lungs and the penis (in the case of ED treatment).


### Precautions

**Ambrisentan:**  Use with caution in patients with liver disease, as it is primarily metabolized by the liver.  Pregnancy category C. Should not be used in women of child-bearing potential unless effective contraception is used.


**Tadalafil:**  Contraindicated in patients taking nitrates (due to risk of severe hypotension).  Use caution in patients with heart problems or those with a history of stroke.  Pregnancy category B.


**Combined Therapy Precautions:**  The physician should carefully consider the potential interactions between ambrisentan and tadalafil, along with other medications the patient may be taking.  Regular monitoring of liver function and blood pressure is crucial.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking these medications suddenly?** A: No, always follow your doctor’s instructions on how to stop taking these medications.  Sudden cessation may be harmful.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed above as serious.

* **Q: How should I store these medications?** A: Store as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Are these medications right for everyone with PAH?** A: No, your physician will assess your condition and medical history to determine the most appropriate treatment plan.  These drugs are only part of the management of this serious condition.

* **Q:  Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking these medications?** A:  Consult your doctor about alcohol consumption while taking these medications, as it may interact negatively with either.
