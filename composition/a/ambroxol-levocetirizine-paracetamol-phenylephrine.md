# Ambroxol + Levocetirizine + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine
### Generic Name
Ambroxol + Levocetirizine + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to provide symptomatic relief from the common cold and flu, particularly those presenting with symptoms affecting the respiratory system and causing allergic reactions.  The combined effect of its components targets multiple symptoms simultaneously.

* **Ambroxol:** Acts as an expectorant, thinning and loosening mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. This helps relieve congestion and coughs associated with respiratory infections.

* **Levocetirizine:** This is an antihistamine, which blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  It helps relieve symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes associated with allergies or cold-related inflammation.

* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  A common analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and fever.

* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and relieving nasal congestion.


This combination medicine is primarily used for relief of symptoms, not to cure the underlying infection.  It's crucial to understand that while it offers symptomatic relief, it doesn't address the root cause of a viral infection like the flu or common cold.



### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary depending on the specific brand and formulation (e.g., tablets, syrup).  **Always follow the instructions provided on the product packaging or as directed by a physician or pharmacist.**  This information is for general knowledge and should not substitute professional medical advice.  There is no standard IV formulation for this combination drug.

* **Adults:**  Dosage typically ranges from one to two tablets or the equivalent amount of syrup every 4-6 hours, as needed, not exceeding the maximum daily dose specified on the label.

* **Children:**  Dosage for children is strictly weight- and age-dependent.  Never administer adult dosage to children. Always consult a pediatrician or pharmacist before giving this medication to a child.  Liquid formulations (syrups) are often preferred for children.


**Important Note:**  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.  Overdosing on paracetamol can cause serious liver damage.

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
