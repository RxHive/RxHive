# Amlodipine + Lisinopril
### Generic Name
Amlodipine/Lisinopril Combination

**Note:**  Amlodipine and Lisinopril are also available as individual medications. This information pertains to the combined formulation.  The specific brand name and formulation details will vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Always refer to your prescription label and consult your pharmacist or doctor for detailed information about your specific medication.


### Usage

Amlodipine/Lisinopril combination is primarily used to treat **high blood pressure (hypertension)**.  It's particularly beneficial for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with either amlodipine or lisinopril alone.  This combination therapy leverages the complementary actions of the two drugs to achieve better blood pressure control.

Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that reduces the production of substances that narrow blood vessels.  Together, they work synergistically to lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  In some cases, this combination might also be considered for patients with **chronic heart failure** to improve cardiac function and reduce symptoms.  However, the use in heart failure should be guided by a physician's careful assessment.


### Dosage

Dosage of Amlodipine/Lisinopril combination varies significantly depending on the individual patient's needs, overall health, other medications they are taking, and the severity of their hypertension.  **It is crucial to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage instructions exactly.**  There is no standard "one-size-fits-all" dosage.

* **Oral Administration:**  This combination is typically available in tablet form.  The doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on individual factors.  Common starting doses are often a low dose of both amlodipine and lisinopril and gradually increase as needed under medical supervision.  The dose is usually administered once daily.

* **IV Administration:** Amlodipine/Lisinopril combination is **not** available for intravenous administration.  Amlodipine and Lisinopril are available as IV medications separately but are usually administered under strict medical supervision in hospital settings for specific situations.


* **Pediatric Use:** The use of this combination in children is generally not recommended.  Amlodipine and lisinopril are sometimes used individually in children with specific conditions, but only under the direct supervision of a pediatric cardiologist or nephrologist.  The dosage will be carefully calculated based on the child's weight and medical status.


* **Geriatric Use:** Older adults may require lower starting doses due to potential increased sensitivity to the medication.  Kidney function should be closely monitored in elderly patients.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Swelling in ankles, feet, or legs
* Dry cough (more common with lisinopril)
* Nausea
* Flushing


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat â€“ seek immediate medical attention)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Hypotension (dangerously low blood pressure)
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Amlodipine relaxes the blood vessels by blocking the entry of calcium ions into the smooth muscle cells of the arteries. This relaxation leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), decreasing the resistance to blood flow and lowering blood pressure.  Lisinopril inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which reduces the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels).  By reducing angiotensin II, lisinopril promotes vasodilation and reduces blood pressure. The combined effect of these two mechanisms results in a more significant reduction in blood pressure compared to using either medication alone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination is contraindicated in individuals with a history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitors, severe aortic stenosis, or hypersensitivity to amlodipine or lisinopril.

* **Drug Interactions:** Many drugs can interact with amlodipine/lisinopril.  Inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, that you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This combination is generally avoided during pregnancy, particularly during the second and third trimesters.  It may also pass into breast milk; consult your doctor about breastfeeding while taking this medication.

* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may have an increased risk of side effects, requiring careful dose adjustment and monitoring.

* **Kidney and Liver Impairment:** Kidney and liver function should be carefully monitored, particularly during the initial stages of treatment and with dose adjustments.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping abruptly can cause a sudden spike in blood pressure, potentially leading to serious health complications.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure further and may increase the risk of side effects. Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q: Will this medication cure my high blood pressure?** A:  This medication helps control high blood pressure, but it doesn't cure it.  It's usually a long-term treatment.
