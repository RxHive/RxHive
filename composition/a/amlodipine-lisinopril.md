# Amlodipine + Lisinopril

**Generic Name:** Amlodipine/Lisinopril

**Usage:**  Amlodipine/Lisinopril is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle).  It combines two medications: amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, and lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor.  The combination often provides better blood pressure control than either drug alone.  It may also be used to treat other conditions as directed by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, amlodipine/lisinopril can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Some common side effects include:

* **Amlodipine related:** Headache, dizziness, swelling in ankles and feet (peripheral edema), flushing, fatigue, palpitations.  Rarely, more serious side effects such as liver problems or allergic reactions can occur.
* **Lisinopril related:** Dry cough (a very common side effect), dizziness, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, nausea, changes in taste, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).  Rarely, more serious side effects such as angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, which is a medical emergency), kidney problems, and allergic reactions can occur.

It is crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary greatly between individuals.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Amlodipine:** This calcium channel blocker relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.  This leads to lower blood pressure.
* **Lisinopril:** This ACE inhibitor blocks the production of a hormone called angiotensin II, which narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, lisinopril helps to widen blood vessels and lower blood pressure.  The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more potent and comprehensive approach to blood pressure management.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take amlodipine/lisinopril with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting amlodipine/lisinopril.  Some medications can interact negatively with this combination.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking amlodipine/lisinopril?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can lower blood pressure further and may increase the risk of side effects. Consult your doctor for specific recommendations.
* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat; difficulty breathing; or hives.
* **Q:  How long will it take to see results?** A:  It may take several weeks for your blood pressure to fully stabilize on this medication.  Regular monitoring by your doctor is essential.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking amlodipine/lisinopril suddenly?** A:  No, you should never stop taking amlodipine/lisinopril suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure. Your doctor will advise on how to gradually discontinue the medication if necessary.
