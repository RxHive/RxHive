# Ampicillin + Dicloxacillin
### Generic Name
Ampicillin/Dicloxacillin Combination

**Note:**  Ampicillin and Dicloxacillin are typically prescribed as separate medications, not a pre-mixed combination.  This information pertains to the *combined use* of these two antibiotics, as sometimes prescribed by a physician. It's crucial to follow your doctor's specific instructions, as dosages and suitability vary depending on individual needs.  There is no standardized single product labeled "Ampicillin/Dicloxacillin."

### Usage

This combination of antibiotics is often used to treat bacterial infections, particularly those involving both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  The rationale for combining them lies in their different mechanisms of action and broader spectrum of bacterial coverage.

* **Ampicillin:** A penicillin-type antibiotic effective against a wide range of gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria.  It's commonly used to treat infections like pneumonia, bronchitis, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and certain types of skin infections.

* **Dicloxacillin:** A penicillinase-resistant penicillin, meaning it's effective against bacteria that produce an enzyme (penicillinase) that typically inactivates other penicillins.  It's primarily used for infections caused by penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of skin infections, boils, and abscesses).

Together, they provide a wider spectrum of antimicrobial activity, improving the chances of successful treatment, especially in cases where the specific bacteria causing the infection are uncertain.  The combined use is most often seen in situations where a broad-spectrum approach is deemed necessary to fight a severe infection or when there's a concern about penicillinase-producing bacteria.


### Dosage

There is no standard, pre-mixed dosage for Ampicillin and Dicloxacillin.  The doctor will determine the appropriate dosage of *each* antibiotic individually based on factors like:

* **Type and Severity of Infection:** More severe infections might necessitate higher doses.
* **Patient's Age and Weight:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary for children and individuals with kidney or liver impairment.
* **Patient's Medical History:**  Pre-existing conditions can influence dosage.


**Dosage will be prescribed separately for each drug.**  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  Oral and IV formulations exist for both ampicillin and dicloxacillin, with IV administration typically reserved for severe infections requiring faster drug delivery.  The physician will specify the route of administration.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (for both Ampicillin and Dicloxacillin):**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramps
* Rash
* Itching
* Yeast infections (thrush)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention)
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Seizures (especially at high doses)
* Blood disorders


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

* **Ampicillin:**  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  This weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis (rupture) and bacterial death.

* **Dicloxacillin:**  It also inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis but is designed to resist inactivation by penicillinase, allowing it to effectively target penicillinase-producing bacteria.


By combining these two antibiotics with different mechanisms and broader coverage, the chances of successfully eradicating the infection are enhanced.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with a history of penicillin allergies should not take ampicillin or dicloxacillin.  Always inform your doctor of any allergies.
* **Kidney and Liver Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before taking either medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Interactions with other drugs:**  Ampicillin and Dicloxacillin can interact with certain other medications.  Disclose all medications you are taking to your doctor.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Moderate alcohol consumption might be alright but excessive consumption can cause harmful interactions. It is best to consult a healthcare professional before combining alcohol with medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking the medication once I feel better?**  A: No, complete the entire course of antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better before finishing.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store the medication?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  Are there any food restrictions while taking these antibiotics?** A:  No specific dietary restrictions are usually necessary, but following a balanced diet will support recovery.

Always consult your doctor or other qualified healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.  The combined use of Ampicillin and Dicloxacillin requires careful medical supervision.  Self-treating can be dangerous.
