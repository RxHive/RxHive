# Ambrisentan
### Generic Name
Ambrisentan

### Usage
Ambrisentan is primarily used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), specifically WHO Group I PAH.  This is a serious condition where blood pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs becomes abnormally high.  It works to improve exercise capacity and reduce the risk of hospitalization due to worsening PAH symptoms.  Ambrisentan is often used in combination with other medications, such as tadalafil, for enhanced effectiveness.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical starting dose of Ambrisentan is 5 mg once daily, which may be taken with or without food. After four weeks, the doctor may increase the dose to 10 mg once daily based on individual tolerance. The maximum recommended dose is 10 mg once daily.  This medication is often used in conjunction with tadalafil.  The combined maximum daily dose would be Ambrisentan 10mg and Tadalafil 40mg.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Ambrisentan in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  Those with mild impairment may not require adjustment, but close monitoring is essential.  Ambrisentan is generally not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  Renal (kidney) impairment may also require careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments, although specific guidelines may vary based on the severity of the impairment. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized dosage recommendations.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Cough

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Flushing
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Constipation
* Oligospermia (reduced sperm count)
* Anemia

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Cardiac failure, dizziness, hypersensitivity reactions, hypotension (low blood pressure), fatigue, fluid retention, increased liver enzyme levels (indicating potential liver damage), nausea, vomiting, and weakness have been reported.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ambrisentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist.  Endothelin is a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow). By blocking the action of endothelin on its receptors (ETA and ETB), Ambrisentan helps to relax and widen the blood vessels in the lungs, reducing the pressure within them.  This improves blood flow and reduces the strain on the heart. While it blocks both ETA and ETB receptors, its effect on ETA is significantly stronger.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ambrisentan is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to Ambrisentan or any of its components.
* Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 3).
* Pregnancy (Category X).
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Breastfeeding.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Pregnancy:** Ambrisentan is highly teratogenic (causes birth defects) and is strictly contraindicated during pregnancy.  Reliable contraception is mandatory for women of childbearing potential.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment require close monitoring.
* **Fluid Retention:** Ambrisentan can cause fluid retention; patients with conditions exacerbated by fluid retention should be carefully monitored.
* **Hematologic Effects:**  Ambrisentan may decrease hemoglobin levels; regular blood tests may be necessary.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ambrisentan can interact with other medications; inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.  This includes over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, and supplements.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Patients with severe renal impairment should use Ambrisentan with caution.
