# Ambrisentan

**Generic Name:** Ambrisentan

**Usage:**

Ambrisentan is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  It's specifically indicated for patients with PAH classified as WHO Group 1, including those with and without prior treatment.  It's often used in combination with other PAH medications.  It can improve exercise capacity and delay disease progression.  It is *not* a first-line treatment for PAH; other therapies are often tried first.

**Side Effects:**

Ambrisentan, like other medications, can cause side effects.  Some of the most common include:

* **Headache:** This is a frequently reported side effect.
* **Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities):**  Fluid retention in the legs and ankles is relatively common.
* **Nasal congestion:**  Stuffiness or a runny nose can occur.
* **Facial flushing:** Redness or warmth in the face.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Liver enzyme elevation:**  This requires monitoring of liver function tests.  Rarely, significant liver injury can occur.


**More serious, though less common, side effects include:**

* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):**  This is a serious concern and requires regular liver function tests.
* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Especially when used with other medications that lower blood pressure.


**How it Works:**

Ambrisentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist.  Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels), and its overproduction contributes to the high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries characteristic of PAH.  Ambrisentan blocks the action of endothelin, thereby relaxing and widening the blood vessels in the lungs, improving blood flow, and reducing pressure.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is Ambrisentan taken?** A: It's typically taken orally, once daily.  The dose is determined by the prescribing physician.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Ambrisentan?** A:  It's generally advised to limit alcohol consumption while taking Ambrisentan, as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly liver damage.  You should discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.

* **Q:  Can I take Ambrisentan if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Ambrisentan is categorized as pregnancy category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to a developing fetus. It should not be used during pregnancy.  It's also generally not recommended during breastfeeding due to the potential for the drug to be passed to the infant.  Discuss this with your doctor if you're pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Ambrisentan?** A: Long-term effects are largely unknown, but regular monitoring of liver function and blood pressure is crucial.  The goal of treatment is to manage PAH symptoms and improve quality of life.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, Ambrisentan can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the liver or blood pressure.  It's vital to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
