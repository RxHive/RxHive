# Ambroxol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Cetirizine

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Cetirizine

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, influenza (flu), and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It combines the actions of three different drugs:

* **Ambroxol:** A mucolytic agent that thins and loosens mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive) that reduces the urge to cough.
* **Cetirizine:** An antihistamine that helps relieve runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes associated with allergies or colds.

This combination is intended for symptomatic relief only and does not treat the underlying cause of the infection. It's important to follow the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Some common side effects may include:

* **Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset. Rarely, allergic reactions.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, constipation, headache.  At high doses, it can have hallucinogenic effects.
* **Cetirizine:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, dizziness.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions.

More serious side effects are rare but require immediate medical attention.  Seek immediate medical help if you experience:  severe allergic reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing), rapid heartbeat, seizures, or unusual changes in behavior.


**How it Works:**

* **Ambroxol:** Increases the production of surfactant in the lungs, which helps to thin and loosen mucus. This makes it easier to expel mucus from the airways.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Acts on the cough center in the brain, suppressing the cough reflex.
* **Cetirizine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  This reduces symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
