# Amikacin (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Amikacin (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Amikacin (oral inhalation) is a powerful antibiotic used primarily to treat infections caused by *Mycobacterium avium* complex (MAC).  This is a type of bacteria that can cause serious lung disease, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS.  Amikacin inhalation is typically used as part of a combination therapy regimen, meaning it's used alongside other medications to increase effectiveness and reduce the risk of resistance. It is considered when other treatment options are limited or unavailable.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For *Mycobacterium avium* complex infections, the usual dose is one 590 mg vial inhaled once daily.  This is administered via a nebulizer over 14-20 minutes.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of inhaled amikacin have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specifically recommended by the manufacturer for hepatic (liver) impairment, as amikacin inhalation doesn't undergo significant liver metabolism.  Similarly, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with renal (kidney) impairment. However, close monitoring of renal function is crucial in all patients.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Voice disorder
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Asthenia (weakness)
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Ototoxicity (hearing damage) â€“ this can include tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Cough
* Bronchospasm
* Exacerbation of existing pulmonary symptoms (worsening of lung conditions)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less frequently reported):**

* Anxiety
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Chest discomfort
* Skin rash
* Weight loss
* Vomiting
* Oral thrush (candidiasis)
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Worsening of neuromuscular conditions (e.g., in patients with myasthenia gravis or peripheral neuropathy)
* Respiratory issues (pneumonia, pneumothorax, respiratory failure)
* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)

**Important Note:** This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by binding to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis in bacteria. By binding to these ribosomes, amikacin disrupts the bacterial protein synthesis process, ultimately inhibiting bacterial growth and killing the bacteria.  This mechanism of action is particularly effective against *Mycobacterium avium* complex.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Amikacin is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to aminoglycosides.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of respiratory problems: Amikacin inhalation is associated with an increased risk of serious respiratory adverse events, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), bronchospasm, and worsening of underlying lung disease.
* Use with caution in patients with neuromuscular disorders (such as myasthenia gravis), pulmonary disease, impaired hearing or balance, or impaired kidney function.  Close monitoring is essential in these patients.
* Interactions with other drugs:  Loop diuretics (such as furosemide) may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity when used with amikacin. Mannitol (systemic) should be avoided due to the potential for increased nephrotoxicity.
* Pregnancy and lactation: The safety of amikacin during pregnancy is unknown. Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's unknown if amikacin is excreted in breast milk following inhalation; therefore, caution is advised during breastfeeding.
