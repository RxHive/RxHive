# Anagliptin
### Generic Name
Anagliptin

### Usage
Anagliptin is a medication used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's classified as a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  Anagliptin works best when used along with diet and exercise. It can be used as a standalone treatment or in combination with other diabetes medications.  Importantly, anagliptin is *not* used for type 1 diabetes or for managing diabetic ketoacidosis.


### Dosage

**Adults (Type 2 Diabetes):**  The typical adult dose is 100 mg taken twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening.  

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with reduced kidney function.  For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 30 mL/min, or those undergoing hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the dose is reduced to 100 mg once daily.  Those with CrCl â‰¥30 mL/min do not require dose adjustment.

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No specific dose adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer for those with liver impairment; however, caution is advised.

* **Combination Therapy:** When used with insulin or other medications that lower blood sugar (such as sulfonylureas or GLP-1 receptor agonists), the dose of these other medications may need to be lowered to prevent dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  Concomitant use with GLP-1 receptor agonists should generally be avoided due to lack of additional benefit.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of anagliptin in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Dizziness
* Edema (swelling)
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Abdominal distention
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Flatulence
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase)
* Increased levels of uric acid
* Anemia
* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include acute pancreatitis.  If you experience any of these or other unusual symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Anagliptin works by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4.  DPP-4 normally breaks down incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP).  These hormones help your body produce more insulin when blood sugar is high and reduce the production of glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar). By blocking DPP-4, anagliptin increases the levels of these incretin hormones, leading to improved blood sugar control.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Anagliptin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication, type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic coma or precoma, severe infections, and during the perioperative period (before and after surgery), or following severe trauma.

* **Interactions:** Anagliptin may interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Particular attention should be paid to potential interactions with insulin, sulfonylureas, other blood sugar-lowering agents, and digoxin.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Anagliptin is generally not recommended during pregnancy, and breastfeeding is not advised while taking this medication.  Alternative treatments are preferred for managing diabetes in pregnancy.

* **Heart Failure:** Anagliptin should be used cautiously in patients with mild to moderate heart failure.  It is contraindicated in patients with severe heart failure.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Anagliptin is eliminated primarily through the kidneys.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced renal function.  Use with caution in patients with severe liver impairment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Anagliptin with food?** A: Yes, Anagliptin can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store Anagliptin?** A: Store Anagliptin as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Anagliptin suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Anagliptin suddenly.  Consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.  Stopping abruptly could lead to worsening of your diabetes.

* **Q: What are the signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?** A: Symptoms can include sweating, shakiness, dizziness, hunger, confusion, and weakness.  If you experience these, check your blood sugar and take appropriate action as advised by your doctor.
