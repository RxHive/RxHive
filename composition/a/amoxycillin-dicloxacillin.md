# Amoxycillin + Dicloxacillin
### Generic Name
Amoxicillin + Dicloxacillin

### Usage

Amoxicillin + Dicloxacillin is a combination antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  It's primarily prescribed for infections where both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are suspected.  This combination is particularly effective against infections of the skin and soft tissues (like cellulitis or abscesses), respiratory tract infections (such as pneumonia in some cases, though other antibiotics are usually preferred), and certain types of ear infections.  It's important to note that this combination is not effective against all types of bacteria, and a doctor will determine its suitability based on the specific infection and bacterial identification (if possible through testing).  This combination is not usually a first-line treatment for many infections; other antibiotics are often preferred due to their broader spectrum of activity or fewer side effects.

### Dosage

Dosage of Amoxicillin + Dicloxacillin varies greatly depending on the individual's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific formulation of the medication.  There isn't a standardized universal dosage.  **It's crucial to follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor exactly.**  Self-adjusting dosage is dangerous and can lead to treatment failure or the development of antibiotic resistance.  

The medication may come in different forms, such as capsules or oral suspension (liquid).  There is no IV formulation of this specific combination available.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment based on the individual circumstances.  Never administer this medication to a child or adult without a physician's explicit instructions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Skin rash
* Yeast infection (thrush)
* Mild allergic reactions (e.g., itching)


Less common but more serious side effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis â€“ difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
*  Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (severe, persistent diarrhea)
* Liver damage (rare but serious)
* Seizures (rare, especially at high doses)


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reactions or other worrisome side effects.**

### How it Works

Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that inhibits the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  Dicloxacillin is also a penicillin-type antibiotic, but it's more resistant to breakdown by certain bacterial enzymes, making it effective against bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin alone.  The combination provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria compared to using either antibiotic individually.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** This medication should not be used if you have a known allergy to penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics.
* **Drug Interactions:** Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Discuss the use of this medication with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  
* **Kidney or Liver Disease:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Children:** The dosage must be carefully determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age and weight.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking the medication once I feel better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you start feeling better before the medication is finished. Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.  Follow specific storage instructions on the medication label.

* **Q:  Is it safe to drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can sometimes interact with medication and increase the risk of side effects. Consult your doctor before consuming alcohol while on this antibiotic.

* **Q:  What if I develop diarrhea while taking this medication?** A: Mild diarrhea is a common side effect, but severe or persistent diarrhea should be reported to your doctor immediately as it might be a sign of a serious infection.
