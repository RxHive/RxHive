# Amoxycillin + Dicloxacillin

It's important to note that I am an AI and cannot give medical advice.  The information below is for informational purposes only and should not be substituted for the advice of a medical professional.  **Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication, including amoxicillin + dicloxacillin.**  A combination of amoxicillin and dicloxacillin is not a standard, readily available generic formulation.  They are typically prescribed separately.  The information below will address each individually, as a combined effect is not routinely studied or prescribed.

**Amoxicillin**

**Generic Name:** Amoxicillin

**Usage:** Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections, including:

* Ear infections (otitis media)
* Respiratory tract infections (bronchitis, pneumonia)
* Skin infections
* Urinary tract infections
* Dental infections


**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash (occasionally severe)
* Yeast infections (thrush)


**How it Works:** Amoxicillin works by inhibiting the growth of bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of their cell walls.


**Dicloxacillin**

**Generic Name:** Dicloxacillin

**Usage:** Dicloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic used to treat infections caused by bacteria resistant to penicillinase (an enzyme that breaks down penicillin). These infections often include:

* Skin infections (cellulitis, impetigo)
* Bone infections (osteomyelitis)


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are similar to amoxicillin and can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramps
* Rash (occasionally severe)
* Yeast infections


**How it Works:** Dicloxacillin, like amoxicillin, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, but it's designed to resist breakdown by penicillinase, allowing it to be effective against penicillinase-producing bacteria.
