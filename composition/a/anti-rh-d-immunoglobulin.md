# Anti Rh D Immunoglobulin

**Generic Name:** Rh(D) Immune Globulin (RhoGAM is a common brand name)

**Usage:**

Rh(D) Immune Globulin is used to prevent Rh incompatibility in pregnant women.  It's administered to Rh-negative mothers who are carrying or have carried an Rh-positive fetus.  The purpose is to prevent the mother from developing antibodies against the Rh-positive blood cells of her baby.  This is crucial because if the mother develops these antibodies, they can cross the placenta and attack the red blood cells of subsequent Rh-positive fetuses, leading to a condition called hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), which can be severe and even fatal.

Specific uses include:

* **At 28 weeks of gestation:**  A prophylactic dose is given to prevent sensitization.
* **After delivery of an Rh-positive baby:** A dose is given to prevent sensitization if the baby is Rh-positive.
* **After any event that may cause fetal-maternal hemorrhage (FMH):**  This includes miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, amniocentesis, abdominal trauma.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild and rare. They may include:

* Pain, redness, swelling, or bruising at the injection site.
* Mild fever.
* Headache.
* Dizziness.
* Muscle aches.

Serious allergic reactions are extremely rare.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, hives, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.


**How it Works:**

Rh(D) Immune Globulin contains antibodies against the Rh D antigen.  When administered to an Rh-negative mother, these antibodies bind to any Rh-positive fetal red blood cells that may have entered the mother's circulation. This prevents the mother's immune system from recognizing the Rh-positive cells as foreign and therefore prevents the production of her own anti-Rh D antibodies.  The injected antibodies are then broken down and eliminated from the body.
