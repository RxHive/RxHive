# Alprostadil

**Generic Name:** Alprostadil

**Usage:**

Alprostadil is used to treat several conditions, depending on the formulation and route of administration:

* **Erectile Dysfunction (ED):**  Administered as an injection directly into the penis (intracavernosal injection) or as a urethral suppository.  It's generally used only when other treatments have failed.
* **Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension:** Administered intravenously to improve blood flow to the lungs in newborns and infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).
* **Maintenance of Ductus Arteriosus:**  Administered intravenously to keep the ductus arteriosus (a blood vessel connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery in a fetus) open in certain situations, such as before heart surgery in newborns.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the route of administration and the condition being treated.  Common side effects include:

* **Intracavernosal Injection (ED):** Pain or discomfort at the injection site, prolonged erection (priapism â€“ a serious complication requiring immediate medical attention), bruising, scarring, fibrosis (scar tissue formation), penile deformity, dizziness, nausea, and headache.
* **Urethral Suppository (ED):** Burning sensation in the urethra, dizziness, headache, and pain in the penis.
* **Intravenous Administration (PPHN/Ductus Arteriosus):**  Low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, breathing problems, decreased blood oxygen levels, fever, and vomiting.


**How it Works:**

Alprostadil is a synthetic form of prostacyclin, a naturally occurring substance that helps relax blood vessels.

* **In Erectile Dysfunction:** It increases blood flow to the penis, causing an erection.
* **In Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension:** It relaxes the blood vessels in the lungs, reducing pressure and improving blood flow.
* **In Maintenance of Ductus Arteriosus:** It keeps the ductus arteriosus open by preventing its constriction.


**FAQs:**

* **Is alprostadil safe?**  Alprostadil can be safe and effective when used as directed by a doctor. However, like all medications, it carries risks of side effects.  The risks and benefits must be carefully weighed.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration and the condition being treated.  For ED, effects can be seen within minutes. For intravenous administration, the effects are generally quicker.
* **What are the potential long-term effects?**  Long-term use, particularly intracavernosal injection for ED, may lead to penile fibrosis (scarring) and penile deformity.
* **Can I use alprostadil without a prescription?** No, alprostadil is a prescription medication and should only be used under the supervision of a doctor.
* **What should I do if I experience a prolonged erection (priapism)?**  This is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.  Prolonged erections can damage penile tissue.
* **Can alprostadil be used by women?** Alprostadil is not typically used to treat conditions in women.  However, it is being investigated for some specific conditions in research settings.
