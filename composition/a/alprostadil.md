# Alprostadil
### Generic Name
Alprostadil

### Usage

Alprostadil is a synthetic form of prostaglandin E1.  Its primary use is in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) in adult men. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the penis, increasing blood flow and facilitating an erection.  Alprostadil is administered in several ways for ED, including intraurethral (inserted into the urethra), intracavernosal injection (injected directly into the penis), and topically as a cream.

A secondary, and significantly different, use for alprostadil is in maintaining the patency (openness) of the ductus arteriosus in newborns with certain congenital heart defects. The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the aorta in the fetus. In some newborns, this vessel needs to remain open temporarily to allow adequate blood flow until corrective surgery can be performed.  In this context, alprostadil is administered intravenously.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the method of administration and the condition being treated.  Precise dosing should always be determined and overseen by a physician.  The following information is for general understanding only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adult Dosage (Erectile Dysfunction):**

* **Intraurethral:**  The initial dose is typically a 125-250 mcg pellet. This can be adjusted upwards or downwards based on response. The maximum frequency is two doses per 24 hours.

* **Topical (cream):** The initial dose is 300 mcg applied to the penis tip 5-30 minutes before intercourse.  Application may be repeated, but not more than 2-3 times per week with at least 24 hours between doses.

* **Intracavernosal injection:** The starting dose and subsequent adjustments vary greatly depending on the underlying cause of ED (vascular, neurogenic, or mixed). The physician will determine the appropriate starting dose and titration schedule, typically starting with a low dose and carefully increasing it as needed, with a maximum dose and frequency to avoid complications.


**Pediatric Dosage (Ductus Arteriosus Patency):**

* **Intravenous:**  The initial dosage is 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min. This rate is adjusted based on the infant's response, with careful monitoring of vital signs.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended by manufacturers for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, a physician may adjust the dose based on individual patient factors.



### Side Effects

Side effects vary depending on the route of administration.  It's crucial to report any adverse effects to your doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects:**

* **Intravenous:** Fever, apnea (especially in infants), flushing.
* **Intraurethral:** Penile pain, urethral burning.
* **Intracavernosal Injection:** Penile pain.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Intravenous:** Hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, seizures, cardiac arrest, various metabolic disturbances.
* **Intraurethral:** Headache, dizziness, testicular pain, urethral bleeding.
* **Intracavernosal Injection:** Prolonged erection (priapism - a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment), hypertension, hematoma at the injection site.


### How it Works

Alprostadil works by mimicking the effects of prostaglandin E1.  It causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) by directly relaxing the smooth muscles in the blood vessels of the penis.  This increased blood flow leads to an erection. In newborns, it similarly relaxes the smooth muscle of the ductus arteriosus, keeping it open.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Alprostadil is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components. Specific contraindications vary depending on the route of administration (see detailed prescribing information).  For example, men with conditions predisposing them to priapism (prolonged erection) should not use intracavernosal or intraurethral alprostadil.

* **Drug Interactions:** Alprostadil can interact with several medications, including antihypertensives, vasoactive drugs, anticoagulants, and platelet aggregation inhibitors.  The concomitant use with other erection-inducing medications should be avoided.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Alprostadil is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Men using alprostadil should use condoms during sexual intercourse with women of childbearing age.

* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should be monitored for potential side effects, particularly hypotension, prolonged erection, and apnea (in infants).


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for alprostadil to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the administration method. Intracavernosal injections generally work faster than intraurethral or topical methods.

* **Q: How should I store alprostadil?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the formulation. Always follow the instructions on the product label.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a prolonged erection (priapism)?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Priapism is a serious condition requiring urgent treatment.

* **Q: Can I use alprostadil if I have other health conditions?** A: Discuss your medical history and current medications with your doctor to determine if alprostadil is safe for you.  Some health conditions may contraindicate its use.

* **Q: Is alprostadil addictive?** A: Alprostadil is not considered an addictive substance.
