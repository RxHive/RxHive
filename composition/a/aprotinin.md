# Aprotinin
### Generic Name
Aprotinin

### Usage
Aprotinin is a medication primarily used to reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions during and after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  It's specifically indicated for patients at high risk of significant blood loss during this procedure.  This is achieved by its action on several blood clotting and inflammatory pathways.  While its primary use is in CABG surgery, it's crucial to note that its use is significantly restricted due to safety concerns.  It is not used for other bleeding conditions.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  A crucial initial step involves administering a 10,000 KIU (1 mL) intravenous (IV) test dose at least 10 minutes before the loading dose. This helps identify potential allergic reactions. The loading dose (1-2 million KIU) is given intravenously after anesthesia induction but before the sternotomy (surgical incision of the breastbone).  A further 1-2 million KIU is added to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) pump prime solution.  A continuous IV infusion (maintenance dose) of 250,000-500,000 KIU/hour is then administered throughout the surgery.  The maximum recommended total dose (including loading and maintenance) is 7 million KIU.  To avoid incompatibility with heparin, which is often used during CABG, each medication should be added separately during CPB circuit recirculation to ensure adequate dilution.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of aprotinin in children have not been established; therefore, it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), including anaphylaxis (severe, life-threatening allergic reaction).  The risk is higher with repeat exposure within 6 months.


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports and/or case studies):**

* Acquired blood coagulation disorders
* Acute renal failure (kidney failure)
* Anaphylactic shock
* Arterial thrombosis (blood clots in arteries)
* Coronary occlusion (blockage of coronary arteries)
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, widespread blood clotting throughout the body)
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)
* Renal tubular necrosis (kidney damage)
* Various other thrombotic events (blood clots)


If any adverse effects occur,  immediate medical attention should be sought.

### How it Works
Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor. This means it blocks the activity of several enzymes (serine proteases) involved in blood clotting, fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots), and inflammation. By inhibiting these enzymes, such as thrombin, plasmin, and kallikrein, aprotinin helps to reduce excessive bleeding and inflammation during surgery.  It also protects certain platelet proteins, which are essential for blood clotting, from damage during the CPB process.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Aprotinin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to aprotinin or any of its components, those with a positive aprotinin-specific IgG antibody test, and those with known or suspected exposure to aprotinin (including through fibrin sealant products) within the past 12 months.

**Interactions:** Aprotinin can interact with several other medications, notably:

*   **Captopril and enalapril:** May reduce their hypotensive (blood pressure-lowering) effects. Concomitant use should be avoided.
*   **Neuromuscular blockers:** Increases the risk of apnea (cessation of breathing). Concomitant use should be avoided.
*   **Tretinoin:** Increases the risk of fatal thrombotic complications. Concomitant use should be avoided.

**Warnings:**  Aprotinin carries a significant risk of serious adverse events, including death and severe allergic reactions (anaphylactoid reactions), especially upon re-exposure.  Careful monitoring for such reactions is essential.  Renal function should be closely monitored.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Aprotinin is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but human studies are lacking. The excretion of aprotinin in breast milk is unknown.

### FAQs
**Q: How is aprotinin administered?**
A: It's administered intravenously (IV).  A test dose precedes the loading dose, and a continuous infusion follows.

**Q: How is aprotinin stored?**
A: Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific storage recommendations.

**Q: What are the most significant risks associated with aprotinin?**
A: The most significant risks include life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and thrombotic (blood clot) events.

**Q: Why is aprotinin use limited?**
A: Because of the high risk of serious and potentially fatal side effects, its use is now highly restricted and is largely replaced by alternative blood conservation strategies.

**Q:  Can aprotinin be used for bleeding outside of CABG surgery?**
A: No, it's not indicated for other bleeding conditions.  Its use is confined to the specific context of reducing blood loss during CABG surgery.
