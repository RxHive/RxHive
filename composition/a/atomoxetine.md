# Atomoxetine
### Generic Name
Atomoxetine

### Usage
Atomoxetine is primarily used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  It helps to improve attention, focus, and reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity associated with ADHD. While not its primary indication, atomoxetine may be considered in some cases of moderate to severe ADHD symptoms which haven't responded well to other treatments.  It's important to note that atomoxetine is *not* approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).


### Dosage

**Adults (â‰¥18 years):**

*   Treatment for ADHD begins with an initial daily dose of 40 mg.
*   This can be increased to 80 mg after a minimum of three days, depending on individual response and tolerability.
*   Further increases to a maximum dose of 100 mg/day may be considered after an additional 2-4 weeks, if necessary, to optimize the therapeutic response.
*   The medication can be taken once daily in the morning or divided into two doses (morning and late afternoon/early evening).
*   Atomoxetine can be discontinued without tapering.

**Children and Adolescents (6-17 years):**

*   The starting dose is approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day.
*   After a minimum of three days, this can be increased to approximately 1.2 mg/kg/day.
*   A maximum dose of 1.4 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/day (whichever is lower) is recommended.
*   Like adults, it can be given once daily in the morning or split into two doses.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary for patients with moderate to severe liver impairment. Consult prescribing information for specific guidance.
*   **Renal Impairment:** Generally, no dosage adjustment is needed for those with kidney problems.

**Important Note:**  The above dosage information is a general guideline.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage based on the individual's age, weight, medical history, and response to treatment.

### How it Works

Atomoxetine works by selectively blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  Norepinephrine plays a crucial role in attention, focus, and impulse control. By preventing its reuptake, atomoxetine increases the amount of norepinephrine available in the brain's synapses, leading to improved cognitive function and a reduction in ADHD symptoms.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Atomoxetine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, those currently taking or having recently stopped monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, pheochromocytoma, severe cardiovascular disorders, or uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.
*   **Interactions:**  Atomoxetine can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect blood pressure, heart rate, or the CYP2D6 enzyme.  Inform your healthcare professional about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Atomoxetine is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully weighed against the potential risks and benefits.
*   **Children and Adolescents:** Close monitoring for suicidal thoughts and behavior is crucial in children and adolescents taking atomoxetine.
*   **Elderly:**  Caution is advised in elderly patients due to potential increased sensitivity to side effects.
*   **Hepatic Impairment:**  Atomoxetine should be used with caution and possibly dose-adjusted in patients with liver problems.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take atomoxetine with alcohol?** A: No, it's best to avoid alcohol while taking atomoxetine as it can enhance its sedative effects.
*   **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The therapeutic effects of atomoxetine may not be fully apparent for several weeks.
*   **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: It's generally safe to stop atomoxetine without tapering, but it's always best to consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.
*   **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store atomoxetine at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
