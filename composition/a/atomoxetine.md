# Atomoxetine

**Generic Name:** Atomoxetine

**Usage:** Atomoxetine is used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults.  It is a nonstimulant medication.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common Side Effects:**  Decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, stomach pain, dizziness, headache, sleep problems (insomnia or drowsiness), fatigue, dry mouth, increased sweating.

* **Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.


**How it Works:** Atomoxetine works primarily by increasing the levels of norepinephrine in the brain. Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in attention, focus, and impulse control. By increasing norepinephrine, atomoxetine helps improve symptoms of ADHD such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.  It is believed to act differently than stimulant medications used for ADHD.
