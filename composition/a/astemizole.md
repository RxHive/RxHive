# Astemizole

**Generic Name:** Astemizole

**Usage:**  Astemizole was once used to relieve allergy symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, and hives.  It's important to note that **astemizole is no longer available in most countries due to serious cardiovascular risks.**  Its use has been discontinued and replaced with safer alternatives.

**Side Effects:**  Astemizole could cause a range of side effects, including:

* **Serious Cardiac Effects:**  This was the primary reason for its withdrawal.  It could prolong the QT interval in the heart, leading to potentially fatal arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.
* **Sedation:**  Drowsiness and fatigue were common.
* **Dry Mouth:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Constipation:**  Another common side effect.
* **Weight Gain:** Reported in some users.
* **Headache:**  A possible side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Another possible side effect.


**How it Works:** Astemizole is a potent histamine H1-receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, it reduces the symptoms of allergies.  However, its mechanism of action also unfortunately involved a significant risk of QT prolongation, hence its removal from the market.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Why is astemizole no longer available?** A:  Astemizole was withdrawn from the market due to its association with serious and potentially fatal heart rhythm problems (QT prolongation and torsades de pointes).  The risk outweighed the benefits.
* **Q: What are the safer alternatives to astemizole?** A:  Many safer antihistamines are available, including cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra), loratadine (Claritin), and desloratadine (Clarinex).  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for advice on choosing the right allergy medication.
* **Q: Can I still get astemizole?** A:  No. It is no longer manufactured or legally available in most countries.  Attempting to obtain it through unofficial channels is dangerous and illegal.
* **Q:  If I took astemizole in the past, should I be concerned?** A: If you experienced no adverse effects while taking astemizole previously, the likelihood of long-term effects is low. However, if you have concerns, consult your doctor.
