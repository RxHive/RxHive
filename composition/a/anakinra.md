# Anakinra
### Generic Name
Anakinra

### Usage
Anakinra is primarily used to reduce the signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults.  It's particularly beneficial for those with moderate to severe RA who haven't responded well to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  Beyond RA, Anakinra is also indicated for treating cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), a group of rare, autoinflammatory disorders.  Specifically, it's used to manage neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), a severe form of CAPS.  While not officially approved for these conditions, Anakinra is sometimes used off-label to treat other inflammatory conditions like familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, recurrent pericarditis, and Schnitzler syndrome.  However, it's crucial to discuss these off-label uses with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:**  The usual subcutaneous (subQ) dose is 100 mg once daily (OD).  The injection should be given at roughly the same time each day.
* **Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS):**  The starting subQ dose for NOMID is 1-2 mg/kg/day.  This dose can be adjusted in 0.5-1 mg/kg increments to manage inflammation, up to a maximum of 8 mg/kg OD or twice daily (BID).

**Children:**

Anakinra is generally not recommended for children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. However, off-label uses in children exist and are carefully managed:

* **Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS):** Dosage is the same as for adults, adjusted based on weight.
* **Familial Mediterranean Fever (off-label):** Children aged 2 years and older may receive a subQ dose of 2 mg/kg/day.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on response.
* **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) (off-label):** Dosage varies depending on the type of JIA (systemic-onset or polyarticular) and the child's weight.  Always consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage and monitoring.
* **Kawasaki disease (off-label):**  Infants older than 2 months and young children may receive 1-6 mg/kg/day, divided into one or two doses, but this should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is usually needed.
* **Renal Impairment:**  For creatinine clearance (CrCl) above 30 mL/min, no adjustment is necessary. For CrCl below 30 mL/min or in end-stage renal disease, administer the dose every other day.  Anakinra isn't dialyzable.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Injection site reactions
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Infections (including serious infections)
* Fever
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Antibody development

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Skin rash
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Anakinra is a recombinant form of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).  Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a protein involved in inflammation. Anakinra works by binding to the IL-1 receptor, preventing IL-1 from triggering inflammation. By blocking IL-1's action, Anakinra helps to reduce inflammation and related symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Anakinra is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Anakinra, *Escherichia coli*-derived proteins, or any of the formulation's components.
* **Interactions:**  Concomitant use with TNF-blocking agents (like etanercept) increases the risk of neutropenia and serious infections; this combination isn't recommended.  Avoid concurrent use with live-virus vaccines.
* **Warnings:**  Anakinra may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections, hypersensitivity reactions, and potentially malignancy.  Close monitoring for infections is essential.  Use caution in patients with asthma or renal impairment and in older adults.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy.  Currently, limited data exists on pregnancy and breastfeeding. While use may be considered in specific cases, careful monitoring is advised.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Anakinra administered?** A: Anakinra is usually injected subcutaneously (under the skin).
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of effect varies depending on the condition being treated. It's important to follow your doctor's instructions and maintain regular use.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Anakinra suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Anakinra without consulting your doctor.  Gradual tapering may be necessary to prevent disease flares.
* **Q: How should I store Anakinra?** A: Store it as instructed on the label, typically refrigerated.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Never double up on doses.
* **Q:  Are there any specific dietary restrictions while on Anakinra?** A: No specific dietary restrictions are typically associated with Anakinra. However, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle is beneficial for overall health and can support management of your condition.
