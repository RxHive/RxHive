# Acetaminophen [paracetamol]
### Generic Name
Acetaminophen (paracetamol)

### Usage
Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is a common over-the-counter (OTC) medication primarily used for the temporary relief of mild to moderate pain and fever.  Its analgesic (pain-relieving) effects are thought to stem from its action on the central nervous system, while its antipyretic (fever-reducing) properties result from its ability to affect the hypothalamus, the body's temperature regulation center.  While primarily used for simple pain and fever, acetaminophen may also be used as an adjunct to other pain medications, particularly opioids, to enhance pain relief after surgery or in other situations where more substantial pain management is necessary.  It's important to note that acetaminophen does not reduce inflammation.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the age, weight, and condition of the individual, as well as the formulation (tablet, liquid, suppository, or intravenous injection).  Always follow the instructions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.

**Adults (oral):**  The typical adult dose is 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 4000 mg (4 grams) per day.  Extended-release formulations may have different dosing schedules.

**Adults (IV):** Intravenous administration is typically reserved for hospitalized patients. Dosage is determined by a physician based on weight and condition, usually 650mg every 4 hours or 1g every 6 hours, not exceeding 4000 mg per day.

**Children (oral):**  Pediatric dosing is strictly weight-based. A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dose in mg/kg, usually ranging from 10-15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours as needed, with a maximum of 5 doses per day.  Always use a calibrated measuring device for liquid formulations.  Never give a child an adult dose.

**Children (IV):** IV acetaminophen for children is also weight-based and administered only under strict medical supervision in a hospital setting.  The dosage and frequency are determined by the physician.

**Children (rectal):** Suppositories are available for children, with dosage based on age and weight, as determined by a healthcare provider.


### Side Effects
Acetaminophen is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These are usually mild and include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Rash
* Allergic reactions (rare)

Serious but less common side effects include liver damage.  This is especially a concern with overdose or long-term use at high doses.  Severe allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, are rare but can be life-threatening.


### How it Works
Acetaminophen's precise mechanism of action is still not fully understood, but it's believed to work primarily by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system (CNS), thus reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to pain and fever.  Unlike non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen has minimal effect on COX enzymes in peripheral tissues, which is why it doesn't have significant anti-inflammatory effects.


### Precautions
* **Liver disease:** Individuals with liver disease should use acetaminophen with extreme caution and under strict medical supervision.  The dosage may need to be reduced, or use may be completely contraindicated.
* **Alcohol use:** Excessive alcohol consumption significantly increases the risk of liver damage when taking acetaminophen.  Avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Other medications:** Some medications interact with acetaminophen.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding in recommended doses, always consult a healthcare provider before taking acetaminophen if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Overdose:** Acetaminophen overdose can cause severe liver damage and is potentially fatal.  Seek immediate medical attention if an overdose is suspected.


### FAQs
* **Can I take acetaminophen with other medications?** It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you're taking before using acetaminophen, as interactions can occur.
* **How should I store acetaminophen?** Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children.
* **How long can I take acetaminophen?** For most short-term pain and fever, acetaminophen can be used for several days.  For more prolonged use, consult a healthcare provider.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
* **What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** Contact a poison control center or emergency services immediately.
