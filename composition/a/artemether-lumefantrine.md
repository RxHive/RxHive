# Artemether + Lumefantrine
### Generic Name
Artemether + Lumefantrine

### Usage

Artemether and lumefantrine is an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) primarily used to treat uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, a particularly dangerous species of malaria parasite.  It's crucial to note that this medication is only effective against malaria; it does not treat other illnesses with similar symptoms.  This combination therapy is specifically designed to address the challenges of drug resistance that have emerged with the use of single-drug antimalarials.  Artemether acts quickly to reduce the parasite load, while lumefantrine provides a longer-lasting effect to eliminate any remaining parasites and prevent relapse.  It is not suitable for treating severe malaria or other forms of malaria caused by different parasites.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on patient weight and age.  Always follow the prescribed dosage instructions carefully.  The medication comes in tablet form.

**Adults (≥35kg):**  The standard treatment is a three-day regimen. The initial dose is 4 tablets (Artemether 80mg/Lumefantrine 480mg) taken together, followed by another 4 tablets 8 hours later.  Then, 4 tablets are administered twice daily (morning and evening) for the next two days, for a total of 24 tablets over three days.

**Adults (25-35kg):** The initial dose is 3 tablets (Artemether 60mg/Lumefantrine 360mg) taken together, followed by another 3 tablets 8 hours later.  Then, 3 tablets are administered twice daily for the next two days, for a total of 18 tablets.

**Children (≥2 months):** Dosage is determined by weight:

* **5-15kg:** 1 tablet (Artemether 20mg/Lumefantrine 120mg) initially, followed by another tablet 8 hours later, and then 1 tablet twice daily for the next two days (total 6 tablets).
* **15-25kg:** 2 tablets (Artemether 40mg/Lumefantrine 240mg) initially, followed by another 2 tablets 8 hours later, and then 2 tablets twice daily for the next two days (total 12 tablets).
* **25-35kg:** 3 tablets (Artemether 60mg/Lumefantrine 360mg) initially, followed by another 3 tablets 8 hours later, and then 3 tablets twice daily for the next two days (total 18 tablets).
* **≥35kg:** Follow adult dosage guidelines.


**Important Administration Notes:**  The tablets should be taken with a full meal to improve absorption. If vomiting occurs within two hours of taking a dose, repeat the dose.  If vomiting is persistent, consult a healthcare provider immediately.  For individuals who cannot swallow tablets whole, they may be crushed and mixed with a small amount of water.

### How it Works

Artemether, a fast-acting component, quickly reduces the number of malaria parasites in the bloodstream.  Its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, inhibits a crucial enzyme in the parasite's life cycle.  Lumefantrine, a slower-acting component, eliminates any remaining parasites and helps prevent a relapse by inhibiting the formation of hemozoin, a byproduct crucial for parasite survival.  The combination of these two drugs offers a synergistic effect, enhancing treatment success and reducing the risk of developing drug-resistant parasites.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Artemether + lumefantrine should not be used if there is a known allergy to either of its components or if the patient is taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, or St. John's Wort).
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions are possible; always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.  Some medications, including some antidepressants and anticonvulsants, can affect the effectiveness of this drug.  Grapefruit juice can also alter drug metabolism.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, should be carefully considered.  The medication should only be used when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus and mother. The information regarding its excretion in breast milk is not definitive, use should be made cautiously, particularly in newborns weighing less than 5 kg. Consult with a healthcare professional for guidance.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.
* **Cardiac Risk:**  There is a potential risk of QT interval prolongation; careful monitoring is necessary for patients with pre-existing heart conditions.
