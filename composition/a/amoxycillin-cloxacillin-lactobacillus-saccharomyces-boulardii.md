# Amoxycillin + Cloxacillin + Lactobacillus + Saccharomyces boulardii
### Generic Name
Amoxycillin + Cloxacillin + Lactobacillus + *Saccharomyces boulardii*

**Note:** This combination is not a standard, pre-packaged generic medicine.  It represents a prescribing strategy where a doctor might combine these four components to address specific patient needs.  The information below reflects the individual actions of each component and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for self-medication with this particular combination.  Always consult a healthcare professional for any medical concerns or before starting any medication.


### Usage

This combination therapy is typically used to treat bacterial infections while simultaneously supporting the gut microbiome. Let's break down the individual components:

* **Amoxicillin:** A penicillin-type antibiotic effective against a wide range of gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria. It's frequently used to treat infections like pneumonia, bronchitis, ear infections (otitis media), sinusitis, and urinary tract infections (UTIs).

* **Cloxacillin:** Another penicillin-type antibiotic, but it's resistant to breakdown by certain bacterial enzymes (beta-lactamases), making it effective against bacteria that inactivate amoxicillin. This often makes it useful in treating infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, including skin infections and some types of pneumonia.

* **Lactobacillus:**  A genus of beneficial bacteria (probiotics) naturally found in the gut.  These probiotics help maintain a healthy balance of gut flora.  Including them in this combination aims to mitigate the potential for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a common side effect of amoxicillin and cloxacillin.

* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** A yeast, also considered a probiotic.  Similar to Lactobacillus, *S. boulardii* helps restore and maintain the gut microbiome, potentially reducing the risk of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues associated with antibiotic use.  It's also sometimes used to treat recurrent *Clostridium difficile* infections.


The combined use of amoxicillin and cloxacillin aims for broader antibacterial coverage. The addition of probiotics (Lactobacillus and *S. boulardii*) seeks to counteract the potential disruption of the gut microbiome caused by the antibiotics.


### Dosage

**Dosage for Amoxicillin and Cloxacillin:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific infection, patient age, weight, and kidney function.  It's crucial to follow the doctor's precise instructions.  These antibiotics are typically given orally (tablets or capsules) or intravenously (IV) depending on the severity of the infection.  There are no standard pediatric dosing guidelines for this specific combination, as the formulation is tailored.

**Dosage for Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii*:**  Dosage also varies depending on the specific product and the patient's needs.  These are generally available as capsules or powder for oral administration.  Follow the instructions on the product label or your doctor's advice.


### Side Effects

**Amoxicillin and Cloxacillin:**

* **Common:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (ranging from mild hives to life-threatening anaphylaxis), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), pseudomembranous colitis (severe intestinal inflammation).

**Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii*:**

Generally well-tolerated, side effects are rare but can include mild gas or bloating.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, particularly severe reactions or those listed as less common but serious, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Amoxicillin and cloxacillin work by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis.  This weakens the bacterial cell walls, leading to cell death and inhibiting bacterial growth.  The probiotics (Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii*) work by competing with harmful bacteria for nutrients and space in the gut, helping to restore a healthy balance of gut flora and prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** A history of penicillin allergy is a contraindication for amoxicillin and cloxacillin.
* **Interactions:**  Amoxicillin and cloxacillin can interact with certain medications, including oral contraceptives, anticoagulants, and some antibiotics.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult a healthcare professional.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Individuals with impaired kidney or liver function may require dosage adjustments.
* **Children:** Use in children should be guided by a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this combination without a doctor's prescription?** A: No.  This combination is not a standardized medication and requires a doctor's prescription tailored to individual needs.

* **Q: How long should I take this combination?** A: The duration of treatment depends on the infection's severity and response to therapy.  Follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the individual product labels.  Generally, antibiotics should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Probiotics may have specific storage requirements.

* **Q: Is it safe to take this combination with alcohol?** A:  Alcohol should be avoided while on antibiotics.  Consult your doctor for specific recommendations.
