# Acyclovir (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Acyclovir (Systemic)

### Usage

Acyclovir is a vital antiviral medication primarily used to treat infections caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Its primary applications include:

* **Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections:** This includes genital herpes (both initial and recurrent episodes), oral herpes (cold sores), and herpes simplex encephalitis (a serious brain infection). Acyclovir can reduce the duration and severity of outbreaks, lessen pain, and prevent further outbreaks (suppressive therapy).

* **Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections:**  Acyclovir treats chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster).  Treatment aims to shorten the duration of the illness, reduce the number of lesions, and alleviate symptoms like pain and itching.  It's particularly important for immunocompromised individuals where these infections can be more severe.

* **Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections:** While less common, acyclovir can be used in certain situations to manage CMV infections, often as prophylaxis (prevention) in high-risk individuals like organ transplant recipients.  The use in CMV is often off-label and may require consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

In some cases, acyclovir may be used off-label for other conditions, such as Bell's palsy, but this should only be considered under the guidance of a physician.


### Dosage

Acyclovir dosages vary significantly depending on the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, renal function, and the severity of the condition.  The medication comes in oral (tablets, capsules, suspension) and intravenous (IV) forms.  **It is crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.**  The information below is for general knowledge and should not substitute professional medical advice.

**Adult Dosage (Examples – Consult prescribing information for complete details):**

* **HSV Genitalis (initial episode, immunocompetent):** Oral: 400 mg three times daily (TID) for 7-10 days.  IV: 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 2-7 days, followed by oral acyclovir.
* **HSV Genitalis (recurrent episode, immunocompetent):** Oral: 400 mg TID for 5 days, or other regimens as directed by a physician.
* **Shingles (immunocompetent):** Oral: 800 mg five times daily for 7 days. IV: 10-15 mg/kg every 8 hours.
* **Chickenpox (immunocompetent):** Oral: 800 mg five times daily for 5-7 days.

**Pediatric Dosage (Examples – Consult prescribing information for complete details):**  Dosages are often calculated based on weight or body surface area (BSA) and are usually lower than adult doses.  Always follow a doctor's instructions.

* **Chickenpox (immunocompetent):** Oral: 20 mg/kg four times daily for 5 days. IV: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours.
* **Shingles (immunocompetent):** Oral (children ≥12): 800 mg every 4 hours for 5-7 days. IV: Varies based on age and weight.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These are generally mild and may resolve on their own.

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Rash
* Itching

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention.

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity)
* Nervous system problems (neurotoxicity), including confusion, seizures, tremors, and hallucinations.
* Low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue that interferes with the herpes viruses' ability to replicate.  It works by mimicking a building block of viral DNA.  The virus incorporates acyclovir into its DNA, but this stops the DNA from being properly completed, effectively halting viral replication.  Acyclovir is only effective against actively replicating viruses; it does not eliminate latent (dormant) viruses.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Acyclovir is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to acyclovir, valacyclovir, or any component of the formulation.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Acyclovir is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Dose adjustments are necessary in patients with reduced kidney function to prevent accumulation and toxicity.  Close monitoring of renal function is essential.
* **Neurologic Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing neurologic conditions because acyclovir can affect the nervous system.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  While specific dosage adjustments may not be needed, caution is advised in patients with severe liver impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Acyclovir is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning that animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies in pregnant women.  It's excreted in breast milk; consult a physician about the risks and benefits.
* **Drug Interactions:** Acyclovir can interact with other medications, particularly those that are also processed by the kidneys (nephrotoxic drugs) or that affect the liver.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Can I take acyclovir with food?**  For oral acyclovir, it can usually be taken with or without food.
* **How should I store acyclovir?** Store oral acyclovir at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can acyclovir cure herpes?**  No, acyclovir does not cure herpes. It manages symptoms and reduces the frequency and severity of outbreaks.
* **Is acyclovir safe for long-term use?**  Long-term use can increase the risk of side effects, especially kidney problems.  Your doctor will monitor you closely if you need long-term therapy.
* **How long does it take for acyclovir to work?**  The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the infection and the dose, but often symptoms start to improve within a few days.
