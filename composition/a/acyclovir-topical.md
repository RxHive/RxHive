# Acyclovir (Topical)
### Generic Name
Acyclovir (Topical)

### Usage
Acyclovir topical is primarily used to treat recurrent herpes labialis, commonly known as cold sores, in individuals with healthy immune systems (immunocompetent).  While its primary use targets cold sores, it may also be used in immunocompromised patients for the treatment of non-life-threatening mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus infections.  It's crucial to understand that acyclovir topical is not a cure for herpes, but rather helps manage outbreaks and reduce their duration and severity.  It's less effective for the initial outbreak of herpes simplex and usually won't be effective in treating genital herpes.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Recurrent Herpes Labialis (Cold Sores):**
    * **Cream 5%:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area five times daily for four days. Treatment should begin at the first sign or symptom of an outbreak.
    * **Buccal Tablet 50mg:**  Apply one tablet to the upper gum (canine fossa) as a single dose at the first sign of symptoms.  Specific application instructions for the buccal tablet are crucial and are detailed in the "General Considerations" section below.

* **Mucocutaneous Herpes Simplex Virus Infection (Immunocompromised Patients):**
    * **Ointment 5%:** Apply a half-inch ribbon of ointment to cover a 4-inch square area every three hours (six times daily) for seven days. Treatment should start at the first sign or symptom.


**Children:**

* **Recurrent Herpes Labialis (Cold Sores):**  Children aged 12 years and older can use the cream formulation in the same way as adults (five times daily for four days).  Use in children younger than 12 years old is not generally recommended for topical acyclovir, and alternative treatments may be preferred.  Always consult a physician before administering this medication to children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment because systemic absorption of topical acyclovir is low. However, it is always advisable to consult a healthcare professional regarding dosage adjustments if needed.

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

### How it Works

Acyclovir topical works by converting into its active form, acyclovir triphosphate, inside the infected cells.  This active form then inhibits the viral DNA polymerase, an enzyme crucial for herpes virus replication. By interfering with this enzyme, acyclovir triphosphate blocks the virus's ability to replicate, thus slowing the progression of the infection and reducing symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Do not use acyclovir topical if you have a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to acyclovir, valacyclovir, or any component of the formulation. If using the buccal tablet, avoid use if you have a hypersensitivity to milk protein concentrate.
* **Interactions:** Topical acyclovir may interfere with the effectiveness of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC). Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking.
* **Use in Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in immunocompromised patients.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Acyclovir is categorized as Pregnancy Category B, meaning that animal studies have not shown risk to the fetus, but human studies are lacking.  The decision to breastfeed while using topical acyclovir should be made cautiously, considering the potential for exposure to the infant. Women with herpetic lesions near or on the breast should avoid breastfeeding. Always consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use it for genital herpes?** A: No, topical acyclovir is not effective for genital herpes. Oral antiviral medications are generally used for this purpose.
