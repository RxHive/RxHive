# Aspirin + Paracetamol + Codeine

**Generic Name:**  Aspirin/Paracetamol/Codeine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and fever.  It's often used for headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, and the common cold. The aspirin and paracetamol provide pain relief and fever reduction, while the codeine adds stronger pain relief, particularly for moderate pain.  **Important Note:** This combination is typically only available with a prescription due to the presence of codeine, a controlled substance.  It is crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and duration of treatment exactly as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.  Do not exceed the recommended dose.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, stomach upset.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), liver damage, kidney problems, bleeding (especially with aspirin), addiction (with prolonged codeine use), slowed breathing (especially with higher doses of codeine).
* **Rare but Potentially Fatal:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Reye's syndrome (in children and teenagers with viral infections), serotonin syndrome (with certain other medications).


**How it Works:**

* **Aspirin:**  Reduces pain and fever by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.  It also has antiplatelet effects, meaning it can thin the blood.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):**  Reduces pain and fever through a mechanism that is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve affecting the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.
* **Codeine:** A narcotic analgesic that acts on the central nervous system to reduce pain. It works by binding to opioid receptors, which reduces the perception of pain.

* **Q: Can I take this medication if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  No, do not take this medication without first consulting your doctor.  Codeine is generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the baby.
