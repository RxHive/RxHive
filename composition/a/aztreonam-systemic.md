# Aztreonam (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Aztreonam (Systemic)

### Usage
Aztreonam is a powerful antibiotic belonging to the monobactam class.  Its primary use is to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those caused by gram-negative bacteria.  This includes a range of serious infections such as:

* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Aztreonam effectively combats bacterial infections in the kidneys and bladder.
* **Lower respiratory tract infections:**  This includes pneumonia and other infections affecting the lungs and airways.
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infection):** A life-threatening condition where bacteria spread throughout the bloodstream. Aztreonam is crucial in tackling this severe infection.
* **Skin and skin-structure infections:**  This includes abscesses, cellulitis, and other infections affecting the skin and tissues.
* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections affecting the organs within the abdomen, such as peritonitis (infection of the abdominal lining).
* **Gynecological infections:** Infections affecting the female reproductive organs.

While the above are primary uses, Aztreonam may also be used in other situations, such as surgical prophylaxis (to prevent infections during and after surgery) or in treating specific infections like bacterial meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord) or osteomyelitis (bone infection), although these applications are often considered off-label.  The use of Aztreonam in these situations usually requires close monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the type and severity of infection, the patient's age and weight, and renal function.  Always follow the prescription provided by your healthcare provider.  The following is general information and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.  Aztreonam is typically administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).

**Adults:**

Dosage for systemic infections (like septicemia, skin infections, intra-abdominal infections, and gynecological infections) ranges from 1 gram to 2 grams every 6-12 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 8 grams.  Higher doses might be required in severe cases or certain conditions like cystic fibrosis. For UTIs, the dosage is typically lower (0.5-1 gram every 8-12 hours). For pneumonia, dosages are generally higher (2 grams every 8 hours).


**Children:**

Pediatric dosing is calculated based on weight (mg/kg).  Doses typically range from 90 mg/kg to 120 mg/kg per day, divided into doses administered every 6-8 hours.  The maximum daily dose also varies depending on the infection's severity, usually up to 8 grams or even higher in certain conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis). Specific pediatric dosing should always be determined by a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare professional.

**Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  Lower doses and/or less frequent administration are usually required. Your doctor will adjust the dose based on your creatinine clearance (CrCl).  Aztreonam is dialyzable, meaning some of it can be removed during dialysis.  Specific adjustments are necessary for patients undergoing dialysis.

**Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not typically recommended for patients with liver impairment, but use should be approached cautiously.


### Side Effects

Aztreonam, like many medications, can cause side effects. These can vary from mild to severe.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site (for IM or IV administration)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (detected through blood tests)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis)
* Changes in blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Kidney problems (increased creatinine levels)
* 
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (a serious bowel infection)

If you experience any side effects, particularly serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Aztreonam is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria directly. It does this by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, a vital structure that provides bacteria with their shape and protection. Aztreonam binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) on the bacterial cell wall, preventing the final stages of cell wall construction. This ultimately leads to bacterial cell lysis (rupture) and death.  Aztreonam is effective mainly against gram-negative bacteria, a category of bacteria with a unique cell wall structure.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Aztreonam should not be used by people who are allergic to it or other beta-lactam antibiotics (like penicillin or cephalosporins).  A history of beta-lactam allergy significantly increases the risk of an allergic reaction to aztreonam.
* **Kidney Function:**  Patients with kidney problems require dosage adjustments.  Aztreonam is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, and impaired kidney function can lead to drug accumulation and toxicity.
* **Liver Function:** Though dosage adjustments aren't typically made for liver problems, caution is advised, and close monitoring is necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Aztreonam falls into pregnancy category B (animal studies show no risk, but human studies are lacking).  It's excreted in breast milk in small amounts; therefore, caution is warranted during breastfeeding.  Discuss the use of Aztreonam with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Aztreonam can interact with other medications, particularly anticoagulants (blood thinners). It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking.

### FAQs

**Q: How long should I take Aztreonam?**
A:  The duration of treatment depends entirely on the infection's type, severity, and your response to the medication. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment length.

**Q: Can I stop taking Aztreonam early if I feel better?**
A: No, stopping the medication early could lead to treatment failure and the potential for the infection to return or become resistant to the antibiotic. Always complete the full course of treatment as prescribed.

**Q: How should I store Aztreonam?**
A:  Follow the storage instructions on the medication label.  Generally, antibiotics should be stored at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.  If you have consistent trouble remembering doses, speak to your healthcare provider or pharmacist about strategies for medication adherence.

**Q: Is Aztreonam safe for children?**
A: Aztreonam can be used in children, but pediatric dosing is essential and should always be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Aztreonam?**
A: There are typically no specific dietary restrictions associated with Aztreonam. However, maintaining a healthy diet can support your overall health while you are recovering from an infection.
