# Alcaftadine + Ketorolac

There is no approved combination drug containing alcaftadine and ketorolac.  Alcaftadine is an antihistamine used in ophthalmic solutions (eye drops) for allergic conjunctivitis. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) available as eye drops, oral tablets, and injections, used to reduce pain and inflammation.  They are used separately, never in a combined formulation.  Therefore, I cannot provide details on a generic Alcaftadine + Ketorolac combination as it doesn't exist.

If you are interested in information on each drug individually, please specify which one you'd like details on (Alcaftadine or Ketorolac) and the route of administration (eye drops, oral, injection).
