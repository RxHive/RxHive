# Alcaftadine + Ketorolac
### Generic Name
Alcaftadine + Ketorolac (This combination is not a standard, pre-approved fixed-dose combination.  The information below reflects the properties of each individual drug and should *not* be interpreted as a recommendation for combining them without explicit direction from a healthcare professional.)

### Usage

**Alcaftadine:** This is a topical ophthalmic (eye) medication used to treat allergic conjunctivitis, a condition causing eye redness, itching, and swelling due to allergies.  It's an antihistamine, meaning it blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction.

**Ketorolac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) available in various forms, including eye drops, oral tablets, and injections.  It's primarily used to reduce pain and inflammation.  Ophthalmic ketorolac is used to treat post-operative inflammation and pain after eye surgery, or to reduce pain and inflammation associated with allergic conjunctivitis.


### Dosage

**Because Alcaftadine and Ketorolac are not typically combined in a pre-mixed formulation, dosage instructions cannot be provided for a combined medication.**  Dosage for each drug would be determined individually by a healthcare professional based on the patient's condition, age, and other factors.  

**Alcaftadine:** Dosage for ophthalmic alcaftadine would be indicated on the prescription label and is typically one or two drops in the affected eye(s) multiple times per day.

**Ketorolac (Ophthalmic):** Dosage for ophthalmic ketorolac would also be specified on the prescription label and typically involves one or two drops in the affected eye(s) several times daily, but varies depending on the specific formulation and the reason for use.


**Ketorolac (Oral):** Oral ketorolac dosage varies greatly by formulation and indication and is always prescribed by a doctor. It's crucial to follow the exact dosage instructions given by your healthcare provider.

**Ketorolac (IV):** Intravenous (IV) ketorolac dosage is strictly determined by a physician and should only be administered under direct medical supervision.

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult a healthcare provider if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works

**Alcaftadine:**  Works by competitively blocking histamine receptors on the surface of mast cells and other cells in the eye, thus preventing histamine from triggering an allergic response. This reduces the inflammation and itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis.


**Ketorolac:**  Inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals involved in inflammation and pain signaling. By reducing prostaglandin levels, ketorolac decreases inflammation and pain.


### Precautions

**Alcaftadine:**  Use caution in patients with known sensitivities to alcaftadine or any of its components.

* **Contraindications:** Ketorolac is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to ketorolac or other NSAIDs, severe renal impairment, active peptic ulcers, bleeding disorders, and those at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
