# Alogliptin
### Generic Name
Alogliptin

### Usage
Alogliptin is a medication primarily used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's used *in addition to* diet and exercise, not as a standalone treatment.  Alogliptin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.  Its mechanism helps regulate blood sugar levels more effectively, improving overall diabetes management.

### Dosage

**Adults with Type 2 Diabetes:** The usual starting dose is 25 mg once daily (OD) by mouth.  However, dosage adjustments are necessary based on kidney function:

* **Mild renal impairment (CrCl ≥60 mL/minute):** No dosage adjustment needed.
* **Moderate renal impairment (CrCl ≥30 to <60 mL/min):** 12.5 mg OD.
* **Severe renal impairment (CrCl ≥15 to <30 mL/min):** 6.25 mg OD.
* **End-stage renal disease (CrCl <15 mL/min or on hemodialysis):** 6.25 mg OD, regardless of dialysis timing.

Dosage adjustments for those with mild to moderate liver impairment are not routinely recommended, but caution is advised.  Severe liver impairment requires careful consideration and may necessitate discontinuation.  Consult a doctor for personalized dosage guidance.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of alogliptin in children have not been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Renal function abnormalities (decreased creatinine clearance)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Bullous pemphigoid (a blistering skin disease)
* Hepatic failure (liver failure)
* Increased liver enzymes
* Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue)
* Severe dermatological reactions (skin rashes, urticaria)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Alogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor.  DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretin hormones.  Incretins are hormones that stimulate insulin release from the pancreas after eating. By blocking DPP-4, alogliptin increases the levels of these incretins, leading to more insulin release when blood sugar is high and less glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar) release.  This improves blood sugar control in a way that's responsive to the body's natural processes.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Alogliptin is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, or severe skin reactions) to alogliptin or its components.
* **Pancreatitis:**  A history of pancreatitis increases the risk of developing pancreatitis while using alogliptin.  Careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in individuals with liver problems.  Liver function tests should be monitored.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on kidney function (see Dosage section).
* **Heart Failure:**  Increased risk of heart failure has been reported.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Alogliptin is a Pregnancy Category B drug, but other diabetes medications are generally preferred during pregnancy.  It is unknown if alogliptin passes into breast milk; use with caution if breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Alogliptin can interact with several medications, including ACE inhibitors, corticosteroids, diuretics, other hypoglycemics, and others. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take alogliptin with or without food?** A: Alogliptin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store alogliptin?** A: Store alogliptin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can alogliptin cause hypoglycemia?** A: While less common than with some other diabetes medications, hypoglycemia is possible, particularly if combined with insulin or sulfonylureas.  Monitor blood sugar levels closely.
* **Q:  How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to notice improvements in blood sugar control varies between individuals. Regular monitoring of blood sugar and HbA1c levels will help track effectiveness.
