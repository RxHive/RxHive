# Anthrax Immune Globulin
### Generic Name
Anthrax Immune Globulin

### Usage

Anthrax Immune Globulin is a medicine used to treat inhalational anthrax in adults and children.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is not a standalone treatment. It's always used *in combination* with appropriate antibacterial drugs.  The antibodies in Anthrax Immune Globulin help neutralize the toxins produced by the *Bacillus anthracis* bacteria, a key component in fighting the severe effects of anthrax infection.  While primarily used for inhalational anthrax, its use might be considered in other forms of anthrax depending on the severity and clinical judgment of the healthcare provider.


### Dosage

**Adults (≥17 years):** For inhalational anthrax, the usual intravenous (IV) dose is 420 units (equivalent to 7 vials).  The infusion should begin slowly at 0.5 mL/minute for 30 minutes.  If tolerated, the rate can be increased gradually, not exceeding 2 mL/minute.  However, in severe cases, a higher dose of 840 units (14 vials) may be necessary.

**Children (≤16 years):** The dosage for children with inhalational anthrax is weight-based and ranges from 60 to 420 units (1 to 7 vials). The IV infusion should start at 0.01 mL/kg/minute for 30 minutes. Similar to adults, the rate can be increased gradually, but never exceeding 0.04 mL/kg/minute or the adult maximum rate of 2 mL/minute. For children weighing over 5 kg, severe cases might require a higher dose (2-14 vials depending on weight).  Specific vial recommendations based on weight are provided in the detailed information.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  However, caution is advised for those with renal (kidney) impairment; the medication should be infused at the lowest possible rate due to the increased risk of acute kidney dysfunction.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Nausea

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Edema (swelling)
* Cardiac arrest
* Acute respiratory distress
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Renal insufficiency (kidney failure)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Thromboembolic events (blood clots)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, immediately contact your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Anthrax Immune Globulin contains antibodies derived from the plasma of people immunized against anthrax. These antibodies work by binding to the protective antigen (PA) of the anthrax toxin. By binding to PA, they prevent the toxin's harmful components (edema factor and lethal factor) from entering cells and causing damage, thus neutralizing the toxin's effects. This provides passive immunity to help the body combat the infection.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Anthrax Immune Globulin is contraindicated in individuals with a history of anaphylaxis or severe reactions to the medication, other human immunoglobulin preparations, or any of its components.  It's also contraindicated in IgA-deficient patients with IgA antibodies and those with a history of IgA hypersensitivity.

**Warnings:** There's an increased risk of aseptic meningitis, hemolysis (red blood cell breakdown), hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions, pulmonary edema, thromboembolic events, and renal impairment.  Caution is necessary in elderly patients and those with pre-existing or at-risk renal dysfunction.

**Interactions:**  Estrogen derivatives might increase the risk of blood clots. Live vaccines might have their effectiveness reduced.  Maltose in the product may interfere with some glucose monitoring systems, leading to inaccurate readings.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  There is limited data on the safety of Anthrax Immune Globulin during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The decision to use it in these situations should be made carefully by a healthcare professional, weighing the potential benefits against the risks.
