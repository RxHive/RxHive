# Amlodipine + Perindopril erbumine

**Generic Name:** Amlodipine/Perindopril

**Usage:**

Amlodipine/Perindopril is used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's a combination medication containing a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an ACE inhibitor (perindopril).  By combining these two drugs, blood pressure is often controlled more effectively than with either drug alone. This combination is particularly useful for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication.  It may also be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (such as stroke or heart attack) in high-risk patients with hypertension.  **Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and frequency.**

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, Amlodipine/Perindopril can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A frequent side effect, usually mild and temporary.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by blood pressure changes.
* **Swelling in ankles, feet, or legs (edema):**  More common with amlodipine.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Cough:** A dry, persistent cough is a relatively common side effect associated with perindopril.
* **Flushing:**  Redness and warmth in the face.

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur.  These include:

* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):**  This is a serious allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can cause dizziness, fainting, or lightheadedness.
* **Kidney problems:**  Especially important for patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
* **Changes in liver function:**  Monitor for symptoms such as yellowing of the skin or eyes.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):**  Especially in patients with kidney problems.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These can manifest as rash, itching, difficulty breathing, or swelling.

This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

**How it Works:**

Amlodipine relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow. Perindopril blocks the action of a hormone called angiotensin II, which causes blood vessels to narrow.  Together, these actions lower blood pressure.  The combination of amlodipine and perindopril leads to a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Amlodipine/Perindopril?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure and increase the risk of side effects.  It's best to limit or avoid alcohol while taking this medication.  Discuss with your doctor.
* **Can I take Amlodipine/Perindopril if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Discuss with your doctor the risks and benefits.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Can I stop taking Amlodipine/Perindopril suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking this medication suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure, which can be dangerous.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose if you need to discontinue the medication.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?**  Amlodipine/Perindopril can interact with several other medications, including potassium supplements, diuretics (water pills), and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **How is my blood pressure monitored while on this medication?** Your doctor will likely monitor your blood pressure regularly to ensure the medication is effective and to check for side effects.
