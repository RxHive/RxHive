# Acitretin
### Generic Name
Acitretin

### Usage
Acitretin is primarily used to treat severe psoriasis in adults that hasn't responded to other treatments.  It's a retinoid, meaning it's a derivative of vitamin A.  Its mechanism of action involves regulating the growth and differentiation of skin cells, reducing inflammation, and thus improving the symptoms of psoriasis.  While its primary use is for psoriasis, it may also be used off-label for other disorders of keratinization, although this is less common and requires careful consideration by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For psoriasis, the usual starting dose is 25-50 mg daily, taken once a day with the main meal.  The maintenance dose will be determined by your doctor based on your response to treatment and tolerance of side effects. It typically remains within the 25-50 mg/day range.  For other keratinization disorders (off-label), the initial dose might be similar but adjusted based on individual response, with a typical range of 10-50 mg/day and a maximum of 50 mg/day.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of acitretin in children haven't been established, so it's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided by the manufacturer for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, use is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal dysfunction. Acitretin is not removed by hemodialysis.

### Side Effects
Acitretin can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially more serious.  It is crucial to report any adverse effects to your doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Dry skin (xeroderma) and mucous membranes (xerostomia, xerophthalmia)
*   Cheilitis (inflammation of the lips)
*   Hair loss (alopecia)
*   Skin irritation, itching (pruritus), rash
*   Changes in nails
*   Elevated levels of lipids (fats) in the blood

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
*   Increased pressure in the brain (pseudotumor cerebri)
*   Depression
*   Bone abnormalities (with long-term use)
*   Severe skin reactions (exfoliative dermatitis)

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Acitretin works by binding to and activating specific receptors inside cells (retinoid X receptors and retinoic acid receptors).  This action influences gene expression, leading to changes in skin cell growth and differentiation.  By affecting these processes, acitretin reduces the rapid skin cell turnover characteristic of psoriasis, decreases inflammation, and helps normalize skin appearance.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Acitretin is absolutely contraindicated in women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during treatment or within three years after stopping treatment.  It's also contraindicated in individuals with severe liver or kidney disease, and those with significantly elevated blood lipid levels.  Concomitant use with methotrexate or tetracyclines is also contraindicated.

**Interactions:** Acitretin can interact with several medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking. For example, Acitretin may decrease the effectiveness of certain birth control pills and increase the risk of side effects with some other medications.

**Warnings:** Acitretin can cause severe birth defects.  Strict adherence to pregnancy prevention protocols is mandatory for women of childbearing age.  Regular monitoring of liver function, blood lipid levels, and blood glucose (in diabetic patients) is essential.  Patients should avoid excessive sun exposure due to photosensitivity. The consumption of alcohol should be avoided during and for two months after completing the treatment due to the potential formation of etretinate, a teratogenic metabolite.

### FAQs
*   **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The response to acitretin varies, but improvements in psoriasis symptoms are usually observed within a few weeks, although it might take longer for a complete response.

*   **Q: How should I store acitretin?** A: Store acitretin as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking acitretin?** A: No. Alcohol consumption is strictly prohibited during treatment and for two months after treatment completion to prevent the formation of etretinate.

*   **Q: Can I donate blood while taking acitretin?** A: No. You should not donate blood during treatment and for at least three years afterward to prevent the possibility of exposure to pregnant women.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.
