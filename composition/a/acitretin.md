# Acitretin

**Generic Name:** Acitretin

**Usage:** Acitretin is a retinoid medication primarily used to treat severe forms of psoriasis and other skin conditions like severe acne.  It's typically reserved for cases that haven't responded to other treatments.  Specifically, it's used for:

* **Severe psoriasis:**  Cases that don't improve with topical treatments or other systemic therapies.
* **Severe acne (nodulocystic acne):**  Especially when other treatments have failed.
* **Ichthyosis:** Certain types of this chronic skin condition characterized by dry, scaly skin.

**Important Note:**  Acitretin is a powerful medication with significant side effects and requires careful monitoring by a dermatologist. It's *not* for mild or moderate psoriasis or acne.


**Side Effects:**  Acitretin can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and some serious.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Dry lips, dry skin, hair thinning, itching, nosebleeds, flushing, headache, nausea, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain.
* **Serious side effects:**  Elevated liver enzymes (hepatotoxicity), increased triglycerides and cholesterol (hyperlipidemia),  inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis),  bone and muscle problems (particularly in long-term use),  depression,  pseudotumor cerebri (increased pressure in the brain),  birth defects (teratogenic effects â€“ see FAQs).
* **Other side effects:**  Increased sensitivity to sunlight, inflammation of the mucous membranes (mucositis).

The severity and frequency of side effects vary greatly between individuals.  Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and lipid levels are essential during treatment.


**How it Works:** Acitretin is a retinoid, a derivative of Vitamin A.  It works by:

* **Reducing skin cell growth and turnover:** This helps to normalize the rapid cell growth characteristic of psoriasis and severe acne.
* **Decreasing inflammation:** It reduces the inflammatory response in the skin, leading to a reduction in redness, scaling, and lesions.


**FAQs:**

* **Is acitretin safe during pregnancy?**  **No.** Acitretin is highly teratogenic, meaning it can cause severe birth defects. Women of childbearing age must use highly effective contraception for at least 3 years *before*, during, and after treatment.  Pregnancy tests are typically required before starting and during treatment.  Men should also avoid fathering children during treatment and for a period after due to the medication's potential to affect sperm.
* **How long does treatment last?** The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition and individual response, ranging from several weeks to months.
* **What are the interactions with other medications?** Acitretin can interact with many other medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you're taking.
* **What are the long-term effects?** Long-term use can increase the risk of bone and muscle problems, liver damage, and other side effects. Regular monitoring is vital.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking acitretin?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage, so moderation or avoidance is recommended.
