# Atazanavir + Ritonavir
### Generic Name
Atazanavir/Ritonavir

### Usage
Atazanavir/Ritonavir is a combination drug used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults and children weighing at least 15 kg (approximately 33 lbs).  It's a crucial part of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a combination of medications that work together to suppress the HIV virus, reducing its ability to replicate and improving the immune system's strength.  The primary use is in treating HIV-1 infection, and it's often used in combination with other antiretroviral agents to achieve optimal viral suppression. Although Atazanavir/Ritonavir is not a cure for HIV, it significantly improves the quality of life for individuals living with the virus.  It's important to note that this medication is part of a larger treatment plan and should only be used under the close supervision of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
Dosage varies considerably depending on the patient's weight, age, and other medications they are taking.  Precise dosing instructions must come directly from a prescribing physician.  

* **Oral:**  The usual adult dose of atazanavir/ritonavir is typically 300mg/100mg once daily, taken with food.  Dosing for children is significantly more complex and weight-based, always determined by the physician.  The available formulations include tablets and oral solutions.

* **IV:** Atazanavir/Ritonavir is not available as an intravenous formulation. It is administered orally.

* **Important Note:**  This medication must be taken consistently as prescribed. Missing doses can significantly impact its effectiveness and potentially lead to drug resistance.



### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Elevated bilirubin levels
* Changes in blood cell counts

Less common but potentially serious side effects:

* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Renal impairment

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor.  Protease is an enzyme HIV needs to replicate.  Atazanavir blocks the action of this enzyme, preventing the virus from creating new copies of itself and reducing the viral load in the body.  Ritonavir is a boosting agent; it increases the levels of atazanavir in the blood, making it more effective.  By working together, atazanavir/ritonavir helps to strengthen the immune system, improving the patient's overall health and reducing the risk of opportunistic infections that often complicate HIV infection.


### Precautions
* **Drug Interactions:** Atazanavir/ritonavir interacts with numerous other medications.  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions can be serious and require dosage adjustments or alternative therapies.

* **Liver Disease:** Individuals with pre-existing liver problems should be carefully monitored while taking this medication as it can affect liver function.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The risks and benefits of using atazanavir/ritonavir during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a healthcare professional.  This medication is not typically recommended during pregnancy and may not be safe during breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:**  Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver function, and viral load are essential to ensure the efficacy of the treatment and to detect any potential adverse effects early.  Patients should report any unusual symptoms to their healthcare provider promptly.
