# Atazanavir + Ritonavir

**Generic Name:** Atazanavir/Ritonavir

**Usage:**

Atazanavir/Ritonavir is a combination antiviral medication used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  It's typically part of a combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, meaning it's used with other HIV medications to suppress the virus and improve the immune system. It's not a cure for HIV, but it can significantly reduce the viral load and improve the patient's health and quality of life.  It's often prescribed for treatment-na√Øve patients (those who haven't taken HIV medications before) and sometimes for experienced patients whose previous regimens have failed.

**Side Effects:**

Atazanavir/Ritonavir can cause a variety of side effects, some common and some rare.  The frequency and severity of side effects vary from person to person.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea:**  A frequent side effect, often manageable with dietary changes.
* **Vomiting:** Can be associated with nausea.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can be mild to severe.
* **Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes):**  Indicates liver problems and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**  Can be mild to severe.
* **Rash:**  Allergic reactions are possible.
* **Hyperbilirubinemia:** Increased bilirubin levels in the blood.
* **Elevated liver enzymes:** Indicative of liver dysfunction.
* **Prolonged QT interval:**  A potential heart rhythm abnormality, particularly relevant for those with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:** Numbness or tingling in the extremities.
* **Increased risk of diabetes:**  May worsen existing diabetes or cause new onset.
* **Increased risk of kidney stones:** Particularly in those with a predisposition.


**How it Works:**

Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor.  Proteases are enzymes HIV needs to replicate.  Atazanavir blocks the action of these enzymes, preventing the virus from making copies of itself.  Ritonavir is a boosting agent; it inhibits the metabolism of atazanavir, allowing higher and more effective levels of atazanavir to remain in the body for a longer period.  This combination maximizes the antiviral effect.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Atazanavir/Ritonavir?** A:  Alcohol can interact negatively with Atazanavir/Ritonavir and increase the risk of side effects, particularly liver damage.
