# Azilsartan medoxomil + Chlorthalidone

**Generic Name:** Azilsartan medoxomil/Chlorthalidone

**Usage:**

Azilsartan medoxomil/Chlorthalidone is a combination medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's prescribed when lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and a single medication haven't been enough to control blood pressure.  The azilsartan medoxomil component is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and chlorthalidone is a thiazide diuretic (water pill).  The combination works synergistically to lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, azilsartan medoxomil/chlorthalidone can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is relatively common, especially when starting the medication.
* **Headache:**  Can occur, often resolving with continued use.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Drowsiness:** Feeling sleepy.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Muscle cramps:** Often in the legs.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** This can cause dizziness or fainting, especially when standing up quickly.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  These can lead to symptoms like muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, or confusion.  Chlorthalidone is especially associated with this.
* **Dehydration:**  Due to the diuretic effect of chlorthalidone.
* **Increased blood sugar:** This can be a problem for people with diabetes.
* **Increased uric acid levels:** This can worsen gout.
* **Allergic reactions:** Though rare, these can range from rash to serious reactions.


**Serious side effects, though less common, require immediate medical attention and include:**

* **Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema):** This is a medical emergency.
* **Signs of kidney problems:** Such as decreased urination or changes in urine color.
* **Severe allergic reactions:** Such as difficulty breathing, rash, hives, or swelling.


**How it Works:**

* **Azilsartan medoxomil:** This ARB blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, azilsartan medoxomil helps relax and widen blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.
* **Chlorthalidone:** This thiazide diuretic increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. This reduces the volume of blood, lowering blood pressure.

The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more potent and effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take azilsartan medoxomil/chlorthalidone with other medications?**  You should inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of this medication, particularly low blood pressure. Limit or avoid alcohol consumption.
