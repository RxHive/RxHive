# Aluminium Hydroxide + Simethicone + Milk Of Magnesia
### Generic Name
Aluminium Hydroxide + Simethicone + Milk of Magnesia (Combination)


Note:  This is a combination product.  There isn't one single "generic name" encompassing all three ingredients, as they are often found in various proprietary formulations with different ratios. The generic names refer to the individual components: Aluminum Hydroxide, Simethicone, and Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia is a brand name for Magnesium Hydroxide).  This information describes the combination's typical effects and uses.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach.  The three components work synergistically:

* **Aluminum Hydroxide:** A common antacid that neutralizes stomach acid. It acts quickly to relieve symptoms of excess stomach acid.
* **Simethicone:** An antiflatulent that helps relieve gas and bloating. It works by breaking down gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines.
* **Magnesium Hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia):** Another antacid that also has a laxative effect.  It neutralizes stomach acid and can help relieve constipation, which can sometimes be associated with indigestion.

Therefore, this combination product targets both the acid-related discomfort and gas often experienced with indigestion and heartburn.  It might be used as needed for occasional relief or, under a doctor's supervision, for more frequent use in managing specific gastrointestinal issues.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific brand and the manufacturer's formulation.  **Always refer to the product label for precise instructions.**  Generally, dosage is determined by the severity of symptoms and the patient's age and health conditions.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

* **Adults:** Typical doses are usually taken orally. The exact amount and frequency will be specified on the product label, usually 1-2 tablets or a measured spoonful of liquid suspension, multiple times daily as needed but not exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose.
* **Children:**  This combination is generally not recommended for children without a doctorâ€™s explicit instructions, as appropriate dosage for children varies widely depending on age and weight.  Never administer medication to a child without first consulting their pediatrician.
* **IV Administration:** This combination is not administered intravenously (IV).  All components are intended for oral use.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Constipation (more likely with higher doses of magnesium hydroxide)
* Diarrhea (more likely with higher doses of magnesium hydroxide)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness

Less common but serious side effects require immediate medical attention and include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe constipation or diarrhea
* Dehydration
* Electrolyte imbalances (especially with prolonged use or in patients with kidney problems)

**Consult a healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects.**


### How it Works

As mentioned, the combination product works through the combined action of its components:

* **Aluminum Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide:** These antacids neutralize stomach acid by chemically reacting with it, reducing its acidity and relieving symptoms like heartburn and acid indigestion.
* **Simethicone:** This works mechanically, reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, allowing them to coalesce into larger bubbles that are more easily passed. This relieves gas and bloating.


### Precautions

* **Kidney Disease:** Patients with kidney disease should exercise caution and consult their doctor before using this medication as it can lead to electrolyte imbalances.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** This combination may interact with certain medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics and some cardiac medications. Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions if you are taking other medications.
* **Long-Term Use:**  Prolonged use without medical supervision is not recommended, particularly for those with kidney problems or other underlying health issues.
* **Allergic Reactions:** If you have a known allergy to any of the components, avoid using this medication.


### FAQs
