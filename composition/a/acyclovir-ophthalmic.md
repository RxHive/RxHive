# Acyclovir (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Acyclovir (Ophthalmic)

### Usage

Acyclovir ophthalmic ointment is primarily used to treat herpes simplex keratitis, a viral infection of the cornea (the clear front part of the eye).  This condition can cause pain, redness, blurred vision, and potentially serious damage to the eye if left untreated.  Acyclovir's antiviral action directly targets the herpes simplex virus, reducing its replication and allowing the eye to heal.

### Dosage

**Herpes simplex keratitis:**

* **Adults and Children:**  A small amount (approximately a 1 cm ribbon) of 3% acyclovir ophthalmic ointment should be applied to the affected eye(s) five times daily, roughly every four hours while awake. Treatment should continue for at least three days after the symptoms of keratitis have resolved.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor for guidance if you have kidney or liver disease.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Transient stinging or burning sensation in the eye upon application.
* Conjunctivitis (pinkeye).
* Eye irritation.

**Less Common, but More Serious Side Effects:**

* Foreign body sensation in the eye.
* Epithelial keratopathy (damage to the surface of the cornea).
* Allergic reactions (e.g., blepharitis, eyelid swelling).
* Blurred vision.


**Important Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog antiviral drug.  Once applied to the eye, it's converted into its active form, acyclovir triphosphate. This active form interferes with the herpes simplex virus's ability to replicate by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase, an enzyme crucial for viral DNA synthesis.  By blocking this process, acyclovir effectively reduces the viral load and allows the body's natural defenses to overcome the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Acyclovir ophthalmic ointment is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to acyclovir, valacyclovir, or any components of the formulation.

* **Warnings:**  Patients should be aware that transient stinging or blurred vision may occur. Contact lens wearers should avoid wearing their lenses during treatment.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  While systemic acyclovir crosses the placenta, the amount absorbed systemically from ophthalmic ointment is minimal. Similarly, although systemic acyclovir is excreted in breast milk, the amount from ophthalmic application is considered insignificant to the nursing infant. However, it's always best to consult with your doctor about the use of any medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


* **Drug Interactions:**  Currently, there's no specific information regarding interactions with other drugs when using acyclovir ophthalmic ointment. However, it's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements you are taking to minimize the risk of potential interactions.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see improvement after using acyclovir ophthalmic ointment?**

A:  Improvement usually starts within a few days, but complete healing can take several weeks depending on the severity of the infection.

**Q: Can I use acyclovir ophthalmic ointment for other types of eye infections?**

A: No.  Acyclovir ophthalmic ointment is specifically for herpes simplex keratitis. It won't be effective against other types of eye infections.  See a doctor for diagnosis and proper treatment.

**Q: How should I store acyclovir ophthalmic ointment?**

A: Store the ointment at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q:  Can I stop using the ointment once my symptoms improve?**

A: No. Continue using the ointment as directed by your doctor even if symptoms improve to prevent recurrence and ensure complete healing.  Stopping too early might lead to a relapse.
