# Aztreonam (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Aztreonam (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Aztreonam for oral inhalation is a monobactam antibiotic specifically used to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis patients with lung infections caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.  It's crucial to understand that this is not a treatment for all cystic fibrosis symptoms or bacterial infections.  Its primary target is this specific bacterium in this specific patient population.

### Dosage

**Adults (Cystic Fibrosis with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection):**

*   **Inhalation (nebulizer):** 75 mg three times daily (TID), with at least 4 hours between doses, for a 28-day cycle. This is followed by a 28-day drug-free period, creating a cyclical treatment pattern.  A bronchodilator should be administered beforehand.

**Children (Cystic Fibrosis):**

*   **Infants â‰¥ 3 months, children, and adolescents:** The dosage is the same as for adults.  However, it's vital to note that safety and effectiveness haven't been established for children under 3 months of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency >10%):**

*   Pharyngolaryngeal pain (throat pain)
*   Cough
*   Nasal congestion
*   Wheezing
*   Fever


**Less Common Side Effects (Frequency 1-10%):**

*   Chest discomfort
*   Skin rash
*   Abdominal pain
*   Vomiting
*   Bronchospasm


**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

*   Arthralgia (joint pain)
*   Facial rash
*   Facial swelling
*   Hypersensitivity reactions
*   Joint swelling
*   Pharyngeal edema (throat swelling)


If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Aztreonam is a bactericidal antibiotic.  It works by interfering with the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* bacteria. This binding prevents the final step in the creation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  The disruption of cell wall synthesis leads to bacterial cell lysis (rupture) and ultimately kills the bacteria.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Aztreonam is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to aztreonam or any component of the formulation.

**Warnings:**

*   There's an increased risk of allergic reactions, particularly in patients with a history of beta-lactam allergies (penicillin or cephalosporin allergies).
*   Bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways) may occur.
*   Use caution in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to beta-lactams.

**Interactions:**  The interaction between aztreonam and *Lactobacillus* or estriol requires monitoring as it might reduce the effectiveness of these agents.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Aztreonam is categorized as Pregnancy Category B (animal studies showed no risk, but human studies are lacking).  While it *may* be acceptable to use in pregnant patients with cystic fibrosis and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections, careful consideration should be given, and this should be discussed with a healthcare provider.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, use during breastfeeding should be approached cautiously and discussed with a healthcare professional.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I mix Aztreonam with other nebulizer medications?**

A: No. Aztreonam must be administered alone; do not mix it with other medications in the nebulizer.  If you are using other inhalers, use them before Aztreonam, following the advice of your physician and the proper order of administration (bronchodilator, then mucolytic, then Aztreonam).

**Q: How long does it take to administer Aztreonam via nebulizer?**

A: Typically, it takes 2-3 minutes.

**Q: How should I store Aztreonam?**

A:  Always follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or on the medication packaging.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

**Q:  Are there any specific monitoring parameters?**

A: Yes. Your physician will likely monitor your FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), a measure of lung function, before treatment and during treatment.
