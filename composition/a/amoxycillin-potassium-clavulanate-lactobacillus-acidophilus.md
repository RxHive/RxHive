# Amoxycillin + Potassium Clavulanate + Lactobacillus Acidophilus

**Generic Name:** Amoxicillin/Clavulanate Potassium + Lactobacillus Acidophilus

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat bacterial infections. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium work together to kill bacteria. Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic, but some bacteria have developed resistance to it. Clavulanate potassium prevents this resistance.  Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic added to help restore the balance of good bacteria in the gut, which can be disrupted by antibiotics.  This combination is often prescribed for infections of the:

* Ears (otitis media)
* Sinuses (sinusitis)
* Lungs (pneumonia, bronchitis)
* Skin and soft tissues
* Urinary tract (UTI)
* Teeth and gums (dental abscesses)


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary, but common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea (most common, often caused by the antibiotic, sometimes mitigated by the probiotic), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Rash, hives, itching, swelling (especially of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), difficulty breathing.  These are serious and require immediate medical attention.
* **Other Possible Side Effects:**  Headache, dizziness, vaginal yeast infection (due to disruption of normal flora), changes in taste.


**How it Works:**

* **Amoxicillin:** This is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Clavulanate Potassium:** This is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that break down penicillin-type antibiotics like amoxicillin, rendering them ineffective. Clavulanate potassium prevents this breakdown, allowing the amoxicillin to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.
* **Lactobacillus Acidophilus:** This is a probiotic, a live microorganism considered beneficial for human health.  It helps restore the balance of gut bacteria that can be disrupted by the antibiotic. This can reduce the incidence and severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
