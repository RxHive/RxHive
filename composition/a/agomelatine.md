# Agomelatine
### Generic Name
Agomelatine

### Usage
Agomelatine is primarily used to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults.  It's not typically used for other depressive disorders or in children.  The medication works differently than many other antidepressants, making it a potentially valuable option for those who haven't responded well to other treatments.

### Dosage

**Adults (Major Depressive Disorder):**

* **Initial Dose:** 25 mg orally once daily at bedtime.
* **Dose Adjustment:** After two weeks, if there's no improvement, the doctor may increase the dose to 50 mg once daily at bedtime (this is two 25mg tablets).  This increase requires careful evaluation of benefits and risks, and liver function must be assessed.
* **Discontinuation:**  No tapering of the dose is needed when stopping agomelatine.
* **Switching from SSRIs/SNRIs:** Agomelatine can be started immediately while gradually reducing the dose of the SSRI/SNRI.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of agomelatine haven't been established in patients under 18 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Agomelatine is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in patients with active liver disease, cirrhosis, or serum transaminase levels exceeding three times the upper limit of normal (ULN). If liver enzyme levels rise to three times the ULN during treatment, and the patient has symptoms, the medication must be stopped. If there are no symptoms, liver function tests should be repeated within 48 hours; if levels remain below three times the ULN, treatment may continue with close monitoring.  Levels above three times the ULN or symptoms of liver damage necessitate immediate discontinuation.

* **Renal Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment, but caution is advised in patients with moderate to severe kidney disease.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Nervous system: Abnormal dreams, anxiety, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia
* Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* Endocrine/Metabolic: Weight gain
* Hepatic: Increased levels of liver enzymes ALT and AST (though usually below three times the ULN)
* Musculoskeletal: Back pain


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1%, post-marketing reports and case studies):**

* Aggressive behavior, agitation, akathisia, angioedema, blurred vision, confusion, eczema, erythematous rash, facial edema, hallucinations, hepatic failure, hepatitis, hyperhidrosis, hypomania, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, irritability, jaundice, mania, migraine, myalgia, nightmares, paresthesia, pruritus, restless legs syndrome, restlessness, suicidal ideation, suicidal tendencies, tinnitus, urinary retention, urticaria, weight loss

**Important Note:** If any side effects occur, especially serious ones, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Agomelatine works by acting on two types of melatonin receptors (MT1 and MT2) in the brain. It also blocks the 5-HT2C receptor. This dual action helps to regulate the body's natural sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm) and affects the release of neurotransmitters like noradrenaline and dopamine, improving mood and reducing depressive symptoms. Unlike many other antidepressants, agomelatine doesn't directly impact serotonin levels.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Agomelatine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components, active liver disease or cirrhosis, serum transaminase levels above three times the ULN, and concomitant use of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (like fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin).
* **Interactions:**  Co-administration with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated.  Estrogens and rifampicin can also interact significantly and may require dose adjustments.
* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior, CNS depression, and hepatic impairment or injury.  Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, mild elevations of liver enzymes, risk factors for liver injury, or a history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.  Agomelatine should generally be avoided in patients aged 75 and older.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Agomelatine is classified as Pregnancy Category B, but use during pregnancy should be avoided.  It's unknown whether it's excreted in breast milk, so a decision to discontinue breastfeeding or treatment must be made based on the individual circumstances.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking agomelatine?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided during treatment due to the risk of increased CNS depression.

* **Q: Can I drive while on agomelatine?** A:  If you experience drowsiness or dizziness, you should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery.

* **Q: How should I store agomelatine?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full therapeutic effect may not be seen for several weeks.  Continue taking the medication as prescribed even if you don't notice immediate improvement.  Consult your doctor if you don't see improvements after an appropriate trial period.

* **Q: Can I stop taking agomelatine suddenly?** A: No dose tapering is typically necessary upon discontinuation; however, always consult your healthcare provider before stopping any medication.
