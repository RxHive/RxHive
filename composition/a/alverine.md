# Alverine
### Generic Name
Alverine

### Usage
Alverine is primarily used to provide symptomatic relief from painful menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea).  It's also used to alleviate symptoms associated with spastic functional gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and diverticular disease of the colon.  These conditions involve painful spasms in the intestines.  Alverine works by relaxing these muscles, thereby reducing pain and discomfort.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For both dysmenorrhea and gastrointestinal spasms, the typical oral dose is 60-120 mg, taken 1 to 3 times daily.

**Children:** Alverine is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. For children aged 12 and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional if you have concerns about your liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not specified in available data) may include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Wheezing
* Nausea
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Abnormal liver function tests
* Hepatitis
* Jaundice
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Other hypersensitivity reactions

If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works
Alverine acts as a spasmolytic agent. This means it directly relaxes the smooth muscles found in the gastrointestinal tract and the uterus.  By reducing the involuntary contractions (spasms) in these muscles, it alleviates the pain associated with conditions like dysmenorrhea and IBS. Importantly, alverine does not affect the heart, blood vessels, or trachea (windpipe).

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Alverine should not be used by individuals with:

* Known hypersensitivity or allergy to alverine or any component of the formulation.
* Paralytic ileus (paralysis of the intestines).
* Intestinal obstruction.

**Warnings:**  Alverine may increase the risk of central nervous system (CNS) effects and abnormal liver function tests, including jaundice.  Use with caution and under medical supervision if you have a history of liver problems.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Alverine should be avoided during pregnancy.  Because it's unknown whether alverine is excreted in breast milk, breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.

**Interactions:** Currently, no significant drug interactions are known. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to ensure there are no potential interactions.
