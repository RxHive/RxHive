# Amoxycillin + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Amoxycillin + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat respiratory tract infections, particularly those involving both bacterial and mucus-related components.  Amoxicillin, a penicillin antibiotic, targets bacterial infections, while ambroxol acts as a mucolytic agent, thinning and loosening mucus to make it easier to cough up.  It's commonly prescribed for conditions like bronchitis, pneumonia (some forms), and sinusitis when a bacterial infection is suspected along with significant mucus production.  **It is crucial to note that this combination should only be used under the guidance of a physician.  Self-medication is dangerous.** The specific usage will depend on the diagnosis and severity of the infection.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but commonly include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion.  More serious gastrointestinal issues are possible, though less common.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis - a medical emergency).  Amoxicillin is a penicillin, and allergic reactions are a possibility, ranging in severity.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache.
* **Liver:** In rare cases, liver problems can occur.
* **Other:**  Changes in taste, thrush (oral yeast infection).

This list is not exhaustive, and more serious, though rarer, side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe allergic reactions or other concerning symptoms.

**How it Works:**

* **Amoxicillin:** This is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to bacterial death.  It's effective against a range of bacteria commonly causing respiratory infections.
* **Ambroxol:** This is a mucolytic agent that works by increasing the secretion of watery mucus and reducing the viscosity (thickness) of existing mucus. This makes it easier to expectorate (cough up) the mucus, thereby clearing the airways and assisting in the recovery process.  The mechanism is not fully understood but is believed to involve influencing the function of goblet cells that produce mucus.
