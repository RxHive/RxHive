# Actarit
### Generic Name
Actarit

### Usage
Actarit is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) primarily used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  It works by modulating the immune system to reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease.  Currently, there is no established use in pediatric populations.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Rheumatoid Arthritis):** The typical oral dosage is 200-300 mg per day, divided into three doses (approximately 100 mg three times a day).  Treatment typically lasts for 24 weeks.  Dosage adjustments should only be made under the strict supervision of a physician.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Actarit in children have not been established.  It should not be administered to children.

### Side Effects
While not all patients experience side effects, some reported adverse reactions include:

* Nephrotic syndrome (kidney disorder)
* Interstitial pneumonia (lung inflammation)
* Acute renal failure (sudden kidney failure)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue)
* Photosensitivity reactions (increased sensitivity to sunlight)

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Actarit, a phenylalkanoic acid derivative, works by modulating the immune system.  Specifically, it acts on the synovial cells (cells lining the joints) in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.  This action reduces cell-to-cell interactions with lymphocytes (immune cells) that infiltrate the synovium (joint lining).  By inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Actarit helps alleviate the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and slow the disease's progression.  The exact mechanisms are complex and still under investigation.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Actarit should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or its components.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should exercise extreme caution and only use Actarit under strict medical supervision due to a lack of established safety data.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Actarit may interact with other medications.  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking before starting Actarit.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Patients with impaired kidney or liver function require careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments, as Actarit is processed by these organs.
* **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function is essential during treatment with Actarit to detect potential adverse effects early.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Actarit?** A:  The onset of therapeutic effects varies between individuals.  It may take several weeks or longer to observe a noticeable improvement in symptoms.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Actarit if I feel better?** A: No.  Do not stop taking Actarit without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to a relapse of symptoms or worsen the underlying condition.
