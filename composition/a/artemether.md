# Artemether
### Generic Name
Artemether

### Usage
Artemether is an antimalarial drug primarily used to treat acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by the *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite.  It's highly effective when used in combination with lumefantrine, a synergistic partner that enhances its antimalarial action.  This combination therapy targets the erythrocytic stages of the parasite's life cycle, meaning it works against the malaria parasites that infect red blood cells.  Artemether/lumefantrine is particularly useful in areas where malaria is resistant to other treatments like chloroquine.  While primarily for uncomplicated malaria, it may also be used to treat infections caused by unidentified Plasmodium species.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Acute Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria):**  The standard dosage involves taking a single dose of 80 mg of artemether along with 480 mg of lumefantrine. This combined dose is repeated at 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after the initial dose, for a total of six doses over three days.  This is an oral medication.


**Pediatric Dosage (Acute Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria):**  Dosage for children is weight-based and administered orally in combination with lumefantrine. The specific artemether dose is as follows:


* 5–14 kg: 20 mg artemether with 120 mg lumefantrine
* 15–24 kg: 40 mg artemether with 240 mg lumefantrine
* 25–34 kg: 60 mg artemether with 360 mg lumefantrine
* >34 kg: 80 mg artemether with 480 mg lumefantrine

Similar to adult dosage, these combined doses are given at the time of diagnosis and repeated at 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours after the initial dose, resulting in a total of six doses over three days.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, dose reduction may be necessary; however, artemether/lumefantrine is contraindicated in cases of severe renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance on appropriate dosage adjustments.

### How it Works

Artemether is metabolized in the body to its active form, dihydroartemisinin.  This active metabolite works by inhibiting the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins within the *Plasmodium* parasite. By disrupting these essential processes, dihydroartemisinin prevents the parasite from multiplying and effectively combats the malaria infection. Lumefantrine works synergistically to further enhance the effectiveness of the treatment.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Artemether/lumefantrine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to artemether, lumefantrine, or any components of the formulation.
* **Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment:**  Patients with severe kidney or liver disease should not use artemether/lumefantrine.
* **Cardiovascular Conditions:** Use caution in patients with a history of QT prolongation (a type of irregular heartbeat) or other significant cardiovascular issues.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood can pose a risk; careful monitoring is needed.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of artemether/lumefantrine during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established.  Use only when clearly needed and under close medical supervision.
* **Drug Interactions:** Consult a physician before using other drugs concurrently as some interactions may exist.
* **Children Under 5kg:**  Use extreme caution in children under 5kg (approximately 11 pounds), as safety and effectiveness in this weight range have not been fully established.
