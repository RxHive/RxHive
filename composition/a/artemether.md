# Artemether

**Generic Name:** Artemether

**Usage:** Artemether is an antimalarial drug. It's used to treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, particularly when it's severe or complicated. It's almost always used in combination with other antimalarial drugs, most commonly lumefantrine (CoartemÂ® is a common brand name for this combination).  It is *not* typically used alone for uncomplicated malaria.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, fatigue
* **Other:**  Rash, itching, fever (paradoxically, sometimes a worsening of fever initially before it subsides), changes in heart rhythm (rare but serious).

More serious, though rare, side effects can include:

* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.
* **Neurological effects:** Seizures, coma (especially at high doses or in patients with pre-existing conditions).
* **Cardiovascular effects:**  Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Liver damage (though generally mild and reversible).

**How it Works:** Artemether is a derivative of artemisinin, a natural compound extracted from the *Artemisia annua* plant.  It works by interfering with the parasite's heme detoxification process.  Malaria parasites produce heme as a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion. Heme is toxic to the parasite, and artemether disrupts the parasite's ability to detoxify it, leading to its death.  The exact mechanism is complex and involves the generation of free radicals within the parasite.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is artemether safe for pregnant women?** A:  The use of artemether during pregnancy should be carefully considered and only used when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. It's crucial to consult a doctor.

* **Q: Can I take artemether with other medications?** A:  Interactions with other medications are possible. It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects usually resolve on their own. If you experience severe side effects, such as allergic reactions, seizures, or severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q:  Can I buy artemether over-the-counter?** A: No.  Artemether is a prescription-only medication.  Self-treating malaria can be dangerous and lead to drug resistance.  Always consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  Artemether typically starts to work quickly, often within hours, but a full course of treatment is necessary to eliminate the parasites completely.

* **Q: Is artemether effective against all types of malaria?** A:  Artemether is primarily effective against *Plasmodium falciparum*, the most dangerous species of malaria.  It may have limited effectiveness against other species.
