# Alvimopan
### Generic Name
Alvimopan

### Usage
Alvimopan is a medication used to speed up the recovery of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after certain types of bowel surgery. Specifically, it's used following surgeries that involve partial removal of the bowel and reconnection (primary anastomosis).  The primary goal is to reduce the time it takes for bowel function to return to normal after surgery, a condition known as postoperative ileus.  This helps patients recover faster and potentially reduces their hospital stay.  It does *not* treat the underlying bowel condition necessitating the surgery.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Postoperative Ileus):** The typical adult dose is 12 mg given orally. The first dose is administered 30 minutes to 5 hours before surgery.  Following surgery, the patient takes 12 mg twice daily (BID), starting the day after surgery, until discharge from the hospital. Treatment should not exceed a maximum of 7 days or 15 total doses (180 mg total).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of alvimopan in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, but use should be cautious. Alvimopan is not recommended for patients with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to severe kidney impairment, but caution is advised. Alvimopan is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Urinary retention
* Anemia
* Back pain

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Myocardial infarction (heart attack) â€“ While rare, a higher incidence of heart attacks has been observed in patients taking alvimopan compared to placebo in long-term studies. The causal relationship remains unclear.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Alvimopan is a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the effects of opioids at specific receptors in the body.  Opioids, often used for pain relief after surgery, can slow down bowel function. By blocking these receptors, alvimopan helps to counteract the opioid-induced slowing of gut motility, facilitating faster recovery of bowel function.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Alvimopan should not be used in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than 7 consecutive days immediately before surgery.

**Increased Risk:** Patients taking alvimopan may have an increased risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack), although a definitive causal link hasn't been established.


**Use with Caution:**
* Patients with gastric or pancreatic anastomosis (surgical connections).
* Patients undergoing surgery for complete bowel obstruction.
* Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
* Patients with renal impairment.
* Patients of Japanese descent (may experience increased GI side effects due to higher drug exposure).


**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Alvimopan is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  The effects on breastfeeding are unknown; the decision to breastfeed should consider the potential risk to the infant and the benefits of breastfeeding and medication for the mother.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take alvimopan with other medications?**
A: Alvimopan may interact with opioid analgesics, potentially increasing the risk of side effects. It may also interact with methylnaltrexone. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

**Q: How should I store alvimopan?**

**Q: How long will I be on alvimopan?**
A: Treatment typically lasts for up to 7 days post-surgery.  The duration depends on your individual recovery.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance if you miss a dose.

**Q: Is alvimopan safe for everyone?**
A: Alvimopan is not suitable for everyone.  People with certain medical conditions, such as severe liver or kidney disease, should not take it.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss its use with their healthcare provider.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medication, including alvimopan.
