# Ardeparin
### Generic Name
Ardeparin

### Usage

Ardeparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant.  Its primary use was in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following knee replacement surgery.  It's crucial to note that Ardeparin was withdrawn from the US market in 2000 and is therefore no longer readily available.  Any information provided here is for historical and educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Knee Replacement Surgery, DVT Prophylaxis):**

Ardeparin was typically administered subcutaneously (subQ). The dosage was calculated based on the patient's weight.  There were two formulations:

* **Formulation 1 (5000 aXaU/0.5 mL):** Recommended for patients up to 100 kg. The dosage was 50 antifactor Xa Units per kilogram (aXaU/kg) of body weight, given every 12 hours. The volume administered was calculated as:  Patient's weight (kg) x 0.005 mL/kg = volume (mL).
* **Formulation 2 (10000 aXaU/0.5 mL):** Recommended for patients over 100 kg. The dosage was also 50 aXaU/kg of body weight every 12 hours, but the volume calculation was: Patient's weight (kg) x 0.0025 mL/kg = volume (mL).

Treatment typically started the evening of surgery or the following morning and continued until the patient was fully mobile or for a maximum of 14 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Safety and efficacy in children were not established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling did not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment. For patients with renal impairment, no adjustment was generally recommended, but caution was advised in cases of severe renal failure. Ardeparin was not considered dialyzable.


### Side Effects

* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Mild bleeding
* Injection site irritation, pain, bruising (ecchymoses)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Erythema (redness)
* Hemorrhagic complications (serious bleeding)


It's important to note that this list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.

### How it Works

Ardeparin works by binding to antithrombin III, a naturally occurring protein that inhibits blood clotting.  This binding enhances antithrombin III's ability to inhibit factor Xa, a crucial enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade. By inhibiting factor Xa, Ardeparin reduces the formation of blood clots.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ardeparin was contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Ardeparin or pork products (as it's derived from pork), active hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia with a positive in vitro test for anti-platelet antibodies against Ardeparin.
* **Increased Risk:**  There was an increased risk of hemorrhage (bleeding), and dermatological allergic reactions (rashes, hives).
* **Cautions:**  Ardeparin should be used with caution in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and those with renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with oral anticoagulants, platelet aggregation inhibitors, or NSAIDs (including aspirin) increased the risk of hemorrhage.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Ardeparin was categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus exist.  Its excretion in breast milk was unknown, thus caution was advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Ardeparin administered?** A: Ardeparin was given via deep subcutaneous injection into the abdomen (avoiding the navel), thighs, or upper arms. It was not for intramuscular or intravenous use.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Given that Ardeparin is no longer available, this question is moot.  Always consult a healthcare provider regarding missed doses of any medication.

* **Q: How should I store Ardeparin?** A:  As Ardeparin is no longer available, this question is irrelevant.  Proper storage instructions would have been detailed on the original product packaging.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects associated with Ardeparin?** A: Long-term effects, as with any medication, can vary. Since Ardeparin is no longer available, this question cannot be answered definitively without access to historical post-market surveillance data.
