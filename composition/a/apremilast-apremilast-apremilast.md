# Apremilast + Apremilast + Apremilast

The request for information on "Apremilast + Apremilast + Apremilast" is nonsensical.  Apremilast is a single drug.  Listing it three times doesn't change its properties or effects.  The information below will therefore describe Apremilast.


**Generic Name:** Apremilast

**Usage:**

Apremilast is primarily used to treat:

* **Psoriatic arthritis:**  It reduces joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.
* **Plaque psoriasis:** It helps clear skin lesions and reduce scaling.
* **Active and progressive psoriatic arthritis:** Used to control symptoms.
* **Oral therapy only:** It is not indicated for topical application.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea

Serious, but less common, side effects can include:

**How it Works:**

Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor.  PDE4 enzymes are involved in inflammation. By inhibiting these enzymes, apremilast reduces the production of inflammatory substances in the body, thereby easing symptoms of psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms.
