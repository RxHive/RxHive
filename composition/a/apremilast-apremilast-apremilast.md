Please note:  I cannot provide medical advice. The information below is for educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice from a doctor or other qualified healthcare provider.  Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting, stopping, or changing any medication, including generic medications.  The repeated inclusion of "Apremilast" in your request suggests a focus on this specific drug.  However, providing information on three identical instances is redundant. I will therefore proceed with information on Apremilast only.


### Generic Name
Apremilast


### Usage
Apremilast is primarily used to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.  It's also approved for treating active psoriatic arthritis in adults.  While its primary use is in these dermatological and rheumatological conditions, research continues to explore its potential in other inflammatory diseases.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's individual needs.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions precisely.

* **Oral Administration (Tablets):**  The typical starting dose is 30 mg twice daily.  The physician may adjust the dosage based on the patient's response and tolerability.  There is no specific dosage adjustment based on weight in general, however, adjustments may be considered for patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment.  

* **Pediatric Use:** Apremilast is not approved for use in children.

* **IV Administration:** Apremilast is not administered intravenously. It is an oral medication only.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of apremilast can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Weight loss

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can include:

* Depression
* Anxiety
* Suicidal thoughts
* Severe allergic reactions (rare but potentially life-threatening)

**It is essential to contact a healthcare professional immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.**


### How it Works
Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor.  PDE4 is an enzyme involved in inflammation. By inhibiting PDE4, apremilast reduces the production of inflammatory substances in the body, thus helping to alleviate the symptoms of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.  This mechanism helps to decrease inflammation and improve symptoms.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Apremilast should not be used in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to apremilast or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** Apremilast may interact with other medications.  It is critical to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of apremilast during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using apremilast if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with moderate to severe hepatic or renal impairment.  Consult with your doctor.

* **Infections:**  Apremilast might increase the risk of infections.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The onset of effects varies, but many patients notice improvements in their symptoms within a few weeks of starting treatment.

* **Q: Can I stop taking apremilast suddenly?** A: No, it's important to follow your doctor's instructions on how to discontinue apremilast to avoid potential withdrawal effects.  Do not stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store apremilast?** A: Store apremilast tablets in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.
