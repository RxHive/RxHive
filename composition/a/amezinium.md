# Amezinium
### Generic Name
Amezinium

### Usage
Amezinium is primarily used as a vasopressor to treat various forms of hypotension (low blood pressure).  This includes essential hypotension (low blood pressure of unknown cause), symptomatic hypotension (low blood pressure caused by another condition), orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up), and age-related hypotension.  It's also used to prevent hypotension during peridural and spinal anesthesia (numbing procedures for surgery) and to counteract hypotension during hemodialysis (kidney dialysis).

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Oral:** For essential, symptomatic, orthostatic, or age-related hypotension, the starting dose is typically 10 mg once or three times daily. The dose is adjusted based on individual response, but should not exceed 30 mg three times daily to minimize side effects.
* **Intravenous (IV):** For hypotension during peridural and spinal anesthesia, 5-10 mg is administered slowly.
* **Oral (Hemodialysis):** For preventing hemodialysis-induced hypotension, 10 mg is given at the start of the dialysis session.

**Children:**

* The dosage for children 12 years and older is the same as for adults for treating hypotension and during peridural/spinal anesthesia.  Amezinium is not typically used in younger children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, nervousness, anxiety, and abnormal gait.
* Cardiovascular: Palpitations, tachycardia (fast heart rate), increased blood pressure (though paradoxically, hypotension is also possible), and chest pain.
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea.
* Other:  Increased thirst, flushing, and fatigue.

Less common but serious side effects may include:  arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), allergic reactions, and significant changes in blood pressure.  Any concerning side effects require immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Amezinium is a sympathomimetic agent. It primarily acts on post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons.  It achieves its effect by selectively inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and the reuptake of norepinephrine within these neurons. This leads to increased norepinephrine levels in the synaptic cleft, resulting in enhanced stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, ultimately causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and an increase in blood pressure.  A small amount of norepinephrine is also directly released from nerve endings.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amezinium is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, cardiovascular shock, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, angle-closure glaucoma, tachyarrhythmia (rapid, irregular heartbeat), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), and vascular sclerosis (hardening of the arteries).
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with severe heart failure, cardiopulmonary disease, or arrhythmias; and in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of Amezinium during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  Use during pregnancy should be avoided unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.
* **Drug Interactions:** Amezinium may interact with many other medications, including MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, other sympathomimetics, and certain antihypertensives.  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.

### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Amezinium?** A: Store Amezinium as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Amezinium suddenly?** A:  No, abruptly stopping Amezinium can be harmful.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Is Amezinium habit-forming?** A: Amezinium is not considered habit-forming.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
