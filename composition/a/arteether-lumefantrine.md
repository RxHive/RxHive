# Arteether + Lumefantrine

**Generic Name:** Artemether + Lumefantrine

**Usage:**

Artemether + lumefantrine is used to treat uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*.  It's crucial to note that this drug is only effective against this specific type of malaria parasite and is not effective against other types of malaria.  It is typically prescribed for a specific duration and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.  A proper diagnosis of malaria is necessary before starting treatment.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Loss of appetite
* Changes in skin color (yellowing)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality) â€“ particularly a concern in patients with pre-existing heart conditions
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine)
* Neurotoxicity (especially in children, characterized by seizures or other neurological symptoms)

**How it Works:**

Artemether and lumefantrine work synergistically to kill the malaria parasite.  Artemether is an artemisinin derivative that rapidly kills the parasites in the blood. Lumefantrine inhibits parasite growth and prevents the parasite from reproducing, thus extending the antimalarial effect and preventing recurrence.
