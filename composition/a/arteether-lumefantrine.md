# Arteether + Lumefantrine
### Generic Name
Artemether + Lumefantrine

### Usage
Artemether + lumefantrine is an antimalarial medication used to treat uncomplicated malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, a particularly dangerous species of malaria parasite.  It's a combination therapy, meaning it uses two different drugs that work together to effectively combat the parasite at different stages of its life cycle. This combination approach helps to prevent the development of drug resistance, a significant concern in malaria treatment. While primarily used for uncomplicated malaria, it might be considered in some instances of severe malaria under strict medical supervision, though this is not its typical application.  The decision to use it in severe cases will be based on individual patient needs and local guidelines.

### Dosage

Dosage is determined by body weight and is typically provided as a fixed combination tablet.  The specific dosage regimen should always be prescribed by a healthcare professional and followed precisely.  It is crucial to complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms improve, to prevent recurrence and the potential development of drug resistance.  There is no standard IV formulation of Artemether + Lumefantrine. It's administered orally only.

**Typical Dosage (Oral Tablets) - Consult a healthcare professional for precise instructions based on individual needs:**

* **Adults and children over 35kg:** The dosage is usually calculated based on weight and the specific formulation's strength.  Follow the doctor's instructions meticulously.  Treatment typically involves taking doses over several days.
* **Children under 35kg:**  Dosage for children under 35 kg needs to be carefully calculated based on body weight.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dose and administration schedule.  Liquid formulations are sometimes used for easier administration to younger children.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite. These are often mild and temporary.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality), severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), neurological problems (including seizures), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), and liver damage.  
* **Important Note:** If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Artemether and lumefantrine work synergistically to eliminate the malaria parasite. Artemether acts quickly to kill the parasites within red blood cells (the asexual blood stages).  Lumefantrine, while having some action against the asexual blood stages, more importantly, prevents the parasites from replicating. This dual action ensures a more thorough elimination of the parasite from the bloodstream and reduces the chances of recurrence and the development of drug resistance.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to either artemether or lumefantrine.
* **Drug Interactions:** Artemether + lumefantrine can interact with several other drugs.  It is crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, including herbal remedies, that you are taking. Some interactions can affect the effectiveness of the antimalarial drug or increase the risk of side effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered after careful evaluation of the risks and benefits by a healthcare professional.  It should be used only when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Individuals with pre-existing liver or kidney problems should use this medication with caution, as it can potentially worsen these conditions.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Cardiac Conditions:**  Individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, especially those affecting the heart's rhythm, should be closely monitored while taking this medication due to the potential risk of a prolonged QT interval.
