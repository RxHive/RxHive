# Alpelisib
### Generic Name
Alpelisib

### Usage

Alpelisib is a targeted therapy used to treat a specific type of advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  It's specifically indicated for postmenopausal women and men with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer that has a *PIK3CA* mutation. This mutation is detected using an FDA-approved test.  Alpelisib is used *after* the cancer has progressed despite treatment with endocrine therapy (hormone-based therapy).  Importantly, it's typically administered in combination with another drug called fulvestrant.  The primary use is to slow or stop the growth of this type of breast cancer. There are currently no notable secondary uses approved outside of this specific indication.

### Dosage

The recommended dosage of Alpelisib is 300 mg once daily (OD) by mouth (oral administration).  This is given in combination with fulvestrant (a recommended dose of 500 mg on days 1, 15, and 29 of the first month, then once monthly thereafter). Treatment continues until the cancer progresses or until the side effects become unbearable.  

**Important Considerations:**  The decision to use Alpelisib is based on the presence of a *PIK3CA* mutation detected in a tumor tissue or plasma sample.  If a plasma test is negative, a tumor tissue biopsy is necessary for confirmation.

Dosage adjustments are sometimes necessary based on factors like liver or kidney function and side effect severity.  Specific guidelines for dose reductions due to side effects like rash, diarrhea, and hyperglycemia are provided in the prescribing information and should be followed closely by a healthcare professional.  The prescribing information details adjustment based on the specific side effect and its severity (graded 1-4, with 4 being the most severe).  There is no established dosage for children or pediatric patients.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Dry mucous membranes
* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Indigestion (dyspepsia)
* Increased serum lipase (a marker of pancreatic function)
* Nausea
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Vomiting
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash
* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* Decreased levels of serum albumin, calcium, glucose, magnesium, and potassium
* Increased levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
* Weight loss
* Decreased platelet count
* Low lymphocyte count (lymphocytopenia)
* Prolonged partial thromboplastin time (a blood clotting test)
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT)
* Increased serum creatinine


Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% or less of patients)  include:

* Severe diarrhea
* Erythema multiforme (a type of skin reaction)
* Urinary tract infections (including those with sepsis)
* Anemia
* Osteonecrosis of the jaw (bone death in the jaw)
* Acute kidney injury
* Pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a severe skin reaction)
* Ketoacidosis (a dangerous complication of diabetes)
* Vaginal dryness
* Severe hypersensitivity reactions

If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Alpelisib is a type of medication called a PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) inhibitor. PI3K is an enzyme involved in cell growth and survival.  In some breast cancers, mutations in the *PI3KCA* gene lead to excessive PI3K activity, promoting uncontrolled cell growth. Alpelisib works by specifically blocking the activity of the PI3K alpha isoform, thus disrupting the signaling pathways that drive cancer cell growth.  By inhibiting this enzyme, Alpelisib helps slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells.  When used with fulvestrant, their combined action is more effective against the tumor than either drug alone.

### Precautions

* **Contraindication:** Alpelisib is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to it or its components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Alpelisib's metabolism and effectiveness can be affected by other drugs.  The potential interactions with BCRP/ABCG2 inhibitors, CYP2C9 substrates, and strong CYP3A4 inducers necessitate careful monitoring and may require dose adjustments or avoidance of concomitant medications.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Alpelisib may harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after the final dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for one week after the final dose.

* **Other Precautions:**  Alpelisib increases the risk of several side effects, including severe skin reactions, gastrointestinal problems (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis), hyperglycemia, severe hypersensitivity reactions, and lung problems (pneumonitis).  Regular monitoring of blood glucose, liver and kidney function, and other relevant parameters is crucial.  Patients should inform their healthcare provider of any new or worsening symptoms.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Alpelisib?**  A:  Treatment continues until your cancer progresses or the side effects become unacceptable. Your doctor will monitor your progress closely.

* **Q: Can I take Alpelisib with other medications?** A: Itâ€™s crucial to discuss all medications and supplements you are taking with your doctor to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose within 9 hours of the scheduled time. If more than 9 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time.

* **Q: How should I store Alpelisib?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label.  Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  Are there long-term effects associated with Alpelisib?** A: Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring for side effects is essential.  Your doctor will discuss any long-term risks with you.
