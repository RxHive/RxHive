# Alpelisib

**Generic Name:** Alpelisib

**Usage:** Alpelisib is an oral medication used in combination with other therapies to treat certain types of breast cancer.  Specifically, it's indicated for:

* **Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-), advanced or metastatic breast cancer** in adult patients with a PIK3CA mutation, usually in combination with fulvestrant (another breast cancer medication).
*  It may also be used in other settings based on clinical trial results and physician judgment.  It's crucial to note that alpelisib is not used for all types of breast cancer.

**Side Effects:**  Alpelisib can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others serious. These can include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Diarrhea (often severe), nausea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, rash, stomatitis (mouth sores), increased blood sugar levels, and hyperglycemia.
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Liver problems (hepatotoxicity),  pneumonitis (lung inflammation), increased risk of infections,  high cholesterol and triglycerides, prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality), and potentially severe skin reactions.

**It is crucial to report any concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.** The frequency and severity of side effects can vary from person to person.


**How it Works:** Alpelisib is a kinase inhibitor.  Specifically, it's a selective inhibitor of the PI3Kα (phosphoinositide 3-kinase alpha) enzyme.  This enzyme is often overactive in certain cancers, including some breast cancers with PIK3CA mutations. By blocking PI3Kα, alpelisib helps to slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells.  It works by interrupting a signaling pathway crucial for cancer cell growth and survival.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is alpelisib a chemotherapy drug?** A: No, alpelisib is a targeted therapy, not a chemotherapy drug.  Targeted therapies work by specifically targeting cancer cells, unlike chemotherapy which affects rapidly dividing cells throughout the body.

* **Q:  Who should not take alpelisib?** A:  Patients with severe liver problems, certain heart rhythm issues, or those who are allergic to alpelisib or its components should not take it.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should generally avoid it.  This is not an exhaustive list; a doctor should determine suitability.

* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?** A:  Alpelisib can interact with other medications.  It's vital to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions can significantly increase the risk of side effects.

* **Q: How is alpelisib administered?** A: Alpelisib is taken orally (by mouth) as a tablet.  The dosage and duration of treatment are determined by a doctor based on individual factors.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of alpelisib?** A: The long-term effects of alpelisib are not fully understood, as research is ongoing.  Regular monitoring is crucial to detect and manage potential long-term side effects.
