# Ammonium Molybdate Tetrahydrate
### Generic Name
Ammonium Molybdate Tetrahydrate

### Usage
Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate is primarily used as a molybdenum supplement in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions.  Its main purpose is to prevent molybdenum deficiency in individuals receiving long-term TPN, where dietary intake of this essential trace mineral is absent. Molybdenum deficiency can lead to various metabolic issues, and supplementation helps avoid these problems.  While not a primary therapeutic agent for any specific disease, it plays a crucial role in supporting overall nutritional health within the context of TPN therapy.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The dosage information below is for molybdenum itself; the provided amount of ammonium molybdate needs to be calculated accordingly.  Remember that an ammonium molybdate injection of 46 mcg/mL provides molybdenum at a concentration of 25 mcg/mL.  Consult official prescribing information for the precise conversion factor of your specific product.

**Adults:**

* **TPN supplementation to prevent deficiency:** 20-120 mcg molybdenum per day intravenously (IV).  The specific dosage will depend on individual needs and the patient's overall metabolic status.
* **Treating established molybdenum deficiency due to prolonged TPN:** 163 mcg/day intravenously for 21 days.


**Children:**  Dosage for children should be determined by a healthcare professional, considering the child's age and overall health. Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for molybdenum in children vary significantly by age group (see below). Supplementation should only occur when deemed necessary by a medical professional.

* **Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for molybdenum (IOM 2011):**
    * Infants <6 months: 2 mcg/day
    * Infants 6-12 months: 3 mcg/day
    * Children 1-3 years: 17 mcg/day
    * Children 3-8 years: 22 mcg/day
    * Children 8-13 years: 34 mcg/day
    * Adolescents >13 years: 43 mcg/day

**Administration:** Ammonium molybdate should always be administered intravenously and *never* undiluted into a peripheral vein to prevent phlebitis (inflammation of the vein).


### Side Effects

Common side effects are not well-defined for therapeutic doses. However, at high doses, the following have been reported:

* Copper deficiency
* Gout-like symptoms

If you experience any adverse effects, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Molybdenum is an essential trace element acting as a cofactor for several enzymes involved in critical metabolic pathways. These enzymes participate in the breakdown (catabolism) of sulfur-containing amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines, which are vital components of proteins and nucleic acids. By acting as a cofactor, molybdenum ensures these enzymes function correctly, enabling proper metabolism and preventing deficiencies related to the impaired activity of these molybdenum-dependent enzymes.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or its components, those with copper deficiency (unless receiving copper supplementation), and for undiluted administration into a peripheral vein.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No specific drug interactions are extensively documented; however, interactions might exist with drugs affecting copper metabolism or those impacting sulfur amino acid metabolism. Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ammonium molybdate is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  While molybdenum is excreted in breast milk, its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and monitoring under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  The increased molybdenum requirements during lactation should be considered.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal impairment may be needed, although specific guidelines are not currently provided by the manufacturer. Close monitoring is essential.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ammonium molybdate without a doctor's prescription?** A: No, ammonium molybdate is typically administered only as part of a total parenteral nutrition regimen under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional. It should not be self-administered.
* **Q: How is ammonium molybdate stored?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.  Generally, it should be stored in a cool, dry place, protected from light and excessive heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider for guidance on how to proceed if you miss a scheduled dose of ammonium molybdate as part of your TPN regimen.
* **Q: Is ammonium molybdate safe for long-term use?** A:  The long-term safety depends on proper monitoring of molybdenum levels and overall metabolic health.  Continuous medical supervision is crucial for long-term administration.  High doses can lead to adverse events.
