# Amoxycillin + Potassium Clavulanate

**Generic Name:** Amoxicillin/Clavulanate Potassium

**Usage:**

Amoxicillin/Clavulanate Potassium is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  It's effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  Common uses include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, tonsillitis
* **Ear infections (otitis media):**  Middle ear infections in children and adults.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Abscesses, cellulitis
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):**  Cystitis, pyelonephritis
* **Dental infections:**  After tooth extraction or other dental procedures.


**Specific uses and dosages will vary depending on the infection and the individual patient.  A doctor should always prescribe and supervise the treatment.**


**Side Effects:**

Amoxicillin/Clavulanate Potassium is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and temporary, but some can be serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching
* **Headache**
* **Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis)**

**Serious, but less common side effects include:**

* **Allergic reactions:**  These can range from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).  Signs of anaphylaxis include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, and a rapid heartbeat.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.**
* **Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD):** This is a serious complication that can occur after taking antibiotics.  Symptoms include severe diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.
* **Liver problems:**  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and pale stools.
* **Seizures:**  More likely in patients with kidney problems or those taking high doses.


**How it Works:**

Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that works by interfering with the bacteria's ability to build their cell walls.  Clavulanate potassium is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  Many bacteria produce beta-lactamases, enzymes that break down penicillin-type antibiotics rendering them ineffective. Clavulanate inhibits these enzymes, allowing amoxicillin to work effectively against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant.
