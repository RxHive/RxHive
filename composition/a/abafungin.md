# Abafungin
### Generic Name
Abafungin

### Usage
Abafungin was an investigational broad-spectrum antifungal agent being explored for the treatment of dermatomycoses (fungal skin infections) and onychomycosis (fungal nail infections).  It was designed to target a range of fungal species commonly causing these infections.  However, it's important to note that Abafungin's development has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and it is not currently available for clinical use.  Therefore, any information provided here is for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for its use.

### Dosage
Since Abafungin never reached the market, there are no officially established dosage recommendations for adults or children.  Dosage information would have been determined through clinical trials had the drug's development continued.

### Side Effects
As Abafungin did not complete clinical development, comprehensive data on side effects are unavailable. Any potential side effects would have been identified during clinical trials, but this information has not been published.

### How it Works
Abafungin was designed to function by inhibiting the enzyme sterol 24-C-methyltransferase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting this enzyme, Abafungin would alter the composition of the fungal cell membrane, leading to disruption of its structure and function, ultimately resulting in fungal cell death.

### Precautions
Given that Abafungin never progressed beyond the investigational phase, detailed precautions and contraindications are not publicly available.  Had it reached the market, information on interactions with other drugs, warnings for pregnant women, children, or the elderly, and other relevant safety measures would have been thoroughly investigated and documented.
