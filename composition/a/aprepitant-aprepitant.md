# Aprepitant + Aprepitant
### Generic Name
Aprepitant

### Usage
Aprepitant is a medication primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (CINV â€“ Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting).  It's particularly effective against delayed-onset nausea and vomiting, which typically occurs one to five days after chemotherapy.  While its main application is in cancer treatment, it may also be used off-label to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with other highly emetogenic (nausea-inducing) treatments.  The use of aprepitant outside of preventing CINV should always be under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the reason for prescribing and the patient's specific circumstances.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Here's a general guideline:

**For preventing CINV (Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting):**

* **Adults (Oral):**  A typical regimen involves a single 125mg dose on Day 1 of chemotherapy, followed by an 80mg dose daily on Days 2 and 3.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary depending on the emetogenic potential of the chemotherapy regimen used.
* **Children (Oral):**  The use of aprepitant in children is not as widely established, and dosage must be carefully determined by a pediatrician or oncologist based on weight and the chemotherapy regimen.  This is not an off-the-shelf dosage.  
* **IV Administration:**  Aprepitant is available as an intravenous (IV) formulation in some regions, but its use and dosage are strictly determined by a medical professional in a hospital setting.  Dosage will vary substantially depending on the patient's needs.

**Important Note:** The information provided here is a simplified overview.  The actual dosage will depend on several factors, including the type and intensity of chemotherapy, the patient's age, weight, liver and kidney function, and other concurrent medications.  A doctor will determine the correct dose.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  These are relatively mild and often resolve without treatment.  They include hiccups, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These require immediate medical attention. They include:
    * Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
    * Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), indicating potential liver problems.
    * Changes in mood or behavior, such as depression, anxiety, or agitation.
    * Irregular heartbeat.

If you experience any side effects, particularly the serious ones listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Aprepitant is a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in the vomiting reflex.  By blocking the NK1 receptors in the brain, aprepitant prevents the signals that trigger nausea and vomiting, effectively reducing or preventing these side effects from chemotherapy or other emetogenic substances.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Aprepitant is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to aprepitant or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Aprepitant can interact with several medications, including certain antifungals, anticoagulants, and other drugs metabolized by the liver.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of aprepitant during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:**  Individuals with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take aprepitant without a prescription?**  A: No, aprepitant is a prescription medication and should only be used as directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How should I store aprepitant?** A: Store aprepitant at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking aprepitant?**  A: It's generally advisable to avoid alcohol while taking aprepitant, as it could increase the risk of side effects or interact with other medications.  Discuss this with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance; do not try to make up for a missed dose on your own.
* **Q:  Is aprepitant habit-forming?** A: No, aprepitant is not considered a habit-forming medication.
