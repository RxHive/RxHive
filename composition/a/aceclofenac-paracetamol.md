**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Paracetamol (Acetaminophen):** This is an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer).  Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is thought to affect the production of prostaglandins in the central nervous system.

The combination of Aceclofenac and Paracetamol provides a synergistic effect, meaning that the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.  Aceclofenac targets inflammation while paracetamol primarily targets pain.
