# Aminoglutethimide
### Generic Name
Aminoglutethimide

### Usage
Aminoglutethimide is primarily used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer and to suppress adrenal function in Cushing's syndrome.  In breast cancer, it works by inhibiting the production of estrogen, a hormone that fuels the growth of some breast cancer cells.  In Cushing's syndrome, it helps control excessive cortisol production by the adrenal glands.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and individual patient response.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage.

* **Breast Cancer:**  Treatment typically begins with 250 mg twice daily for two weeks, then gradually increases to a maximum of 1 gram daily.  This is usually combined with hydrocortisone (20-40 mg nightly) to replace the cortisol that aminoglutethimide suppresses.  Treatment often continues for a minimum of 2.5 months at the full dose.

* **Cushing's Syndrome:** Initial dosage is 250 mg four times daily (every 6 hours).  The dose can be adjusted upwards (in increments of 250 mg every 1-2 weeks) to a maximum of 2 grams daily, based on monitoring of cortisol levels.  Hydrocortisone replacement (e.g., 20-30 mg daily in the morning) may be necessary.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of aminoglutethimide in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  In patients with kidney problems (renal impairment), the dose may need to be reduced because aminoglutethimide is primarily excreted through the urine.  A healthcare professional should carefully adjust the dosage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Skin rashes
* Lethargy
* Headache
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Vomiting
* Fever

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Agranulocytosis (severely low white blood cell count)
* Pancytopenia (low counts of all blood cells)
* Adrenal insufficiency (failure of the adrenal glands to produce enough hormones)
* Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)
* Gastrointestinal toxicity (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Tachyarrhythmia (rapid heartbeat)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Aminoglutethimide interferes with the production of steroid hormones in the body.  It inhibits several enzymes involved in steroid synthesis, including aromatase (the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens) and enzymes involved in cortisol production. By blocking these enzymes, it reduces the levels of estrogen (important in some breast cancers) and cortisol (excessive in Cushing's syndrome).  Because it also affects cortisol production, supplemental hydrocortisone is often given to prevent adrenal insufficiency.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Aminoglutethimide should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to glutethimide or aminoglutethimide.

* **Drug Interactions:** Aminoglutethimide can accelerate the metabolism of dexamethasone, requiring the use of hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid replacement if needed. It can also diminish the effects of coumarin and warfarin anticoagulants.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Aminoglutethimide is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus. It's not known if it's excreted in breast milk, so a decision regarding its use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, carefully weighing the benefits and risks.

* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor blood pressure and thyroid function regularly.  Baseline and periodic blood tests (hematologic studies) are recommended to check for blood cell abnormalities.  Liver function tests may also be necessary.  Patients should be aware of the potential for hypotension, tachyarrhythmia, and gastrointestinal issues.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take aminoglutethimide with food?** A: Yes, aminoglutethimide may be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store aminoglutethimide?** A: Store aminoglutethimide as directed on the prescription label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.  Consult with your healthcare provider if you have questions or concerns.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking aminoglutethimide suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking aminoglutethimide without first consulting your healthcare provider.  Stopping suddenly could have serious consequences.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of aminoglutethimide?**  A: Long-term use can be associated with adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism; regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is necessary.
