# Axitinib
### Generic Name
Axitinib

### Usage
Axitinib is primarily used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer) that has not responded to or has progressed after one prior systemic therapy (treatment affecting the whole body).  It's also sometimes used off-label for the treatment of advanced differentiated thyroid cancer, though this use isn't officially approved by regulatory agencies.  In both cases, axitinib targets the growth of cancer cells by interfering with their blood supply.

### Dosage
Axitinib dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and whether it's used as a single agent or in combination with other therapies.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's precise instructions.  

**Renal Cell Carcinoma (Adult):**

* **Second-line single-agent therapy:** The usual starting dose is 5 mg twice daily (BID), taken approximately every 12 hours.  This dose can be increased to 7 mg BID, and then 10 mg BID if tolerated for at least two consecutive weeks.  If side effects occur, the dose may be reduced to 3 mg BID and then 2 mg BID.


* **First-line combination therapy (with avelumab or pembrolizumab):**  The starting dose is typically 5mg BID.  Dosage adjustments (increases or decreases) are made based on tolerability and response, usually after 2 weeks (avelumab) or 6 weeks (pembrolizumab), following the same principles as outlined above for second-line single therapy.

**Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (Adult, Off-label):**

Dosage approaches vary. Some regimens start with 5 mg BID on an empty stomach, with dose adjustments (in 20% increments) based on response and tolerance. Others start with 5 mg BID with food, with potential increases if tolerated.  Dose reductions are made in case of side effects.  This off-label use requires careful monitoring by a physician.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of axitinib in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary based on factors such as liver or kidney function.  Patients with mild hepatic impairment generally don't require initial dose adjustment, whereas those with moderate impairment might need a 50% dose reduction. Severe impairment may preclude its use.  Similarly, kidney function impacts dosing decisions in some cases, and caution is advised for individuals with severely compromised kidney function.

**Administration:** Axitinib is an oral medication, typically taken as tablets.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Decreased appetite
* Hand-foot syndrome (pain and redness of the palms and soles)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Heart attack
* Stroke
* Bleeding (including internal bleeding)
* Blood clots
* Liver damage
* Kidney damage
* Thyroid problems
* Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS - a rare but serious brain disorder)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Axitinib is a type of targeted therapy known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the activity of certain enzymes called tyrosine kinases, specifically vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs).  These receptors are crucial for the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), which tumors need to grow and spread. By inhibiting VEGFRs, axitinib reduces the blood supply to the tumor, thereby slowing or stopping its growth.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Axitinib should not be used by individuals with known allergies to axitinib or its components.
* **Cardiovascular Issues:**  Axitinib can increase the risk of heart problems, including heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots.  Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or risk factors should be carefully monitored.
* **Bleeding:**  Axitinib increases the risk of bleeding. Individuals with bleeding disorders or who are taking medications that increase bleeding risk should discuss this with their physician.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Axitinib can cause liver damage. Liver function tests should be monitored regularly.
* **Hypertension:** Axitinib frequently elevates blood pressure. Blood pressure monitoring is crucial.
* **Renal Impairment:** Caution is needed in individuals with reduced kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Axitinib is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus. Effective contraception is essential for women of reproductive age during treatment and for a week after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for two weeks afterward.
* **Drug Interactions:** Axitinib can interact with certain medications, particularly those metabolized by the liver enzymes CYP3A4/5.  Discuss all current medications with your doctor to avoid potential interactions.
* **Surgery:** Axitinib should be temporarily stopped before elective surgery and for a period following major surgery to allow for adequate wound healing.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Axitinib with food?** A: Axitinib can generally be taken with or without food, but consistency is recommended.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Simply resume your regular dosing schedule.

* **Q: How should I store Axitinib?** A: Store Axitinib at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Axitinib?** A: Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice, as they can increase axitinib levels in the blood.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Axitinib?** A:  Consult your doctor. Alcohol can potentially interact with some medications, and it's best to discuss this with your healthcare provider before combining it with axitinib.

* **Q:  How long will I need to take Axitinib?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your individual response and is determined by your physician.
