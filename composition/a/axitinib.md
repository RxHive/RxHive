**How it Works:** Axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by blocking the activity of certain enzymes called tyrosine kinases, specifically vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs).  These receptors play a crucial role in the growth and spread of blood vessels that feed tumors. By inhibiting VEGFRs, axitinib reduces the blood supply to the tumor, hindering its growth and potentially causing it to shrink.
