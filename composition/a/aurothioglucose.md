# Aurothioglucose
### Generic Name
Aurothioglucose

### Usage
Aurothioglucose is a gold-containing medication that was formerly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.  This was specifically in cases where other treatments had proven ineffective. It's important to note that due to significant side effects, limited efficacy compared to newer treatments, and a slow onset of action, its use has dramatically decreased since the 1980s.  Aurothioglucose is no longer widely available in many countries, including the United States and the Netherlands.  It is essentially obsolete in modern rheumatologic practice.

### Dosage
Because Aurothioglucose is no longer widely available, specific dosage information is difficult to find and should not be relied upon.  Historically, it was administered via intramuscular injection, with dosage and frequency varying depending on the patient's response and the severity of their arthritis.  Dosage and administration were strictly determined and monitored by a physician specializing in rheumatology.  Any attempt to use this information to self-medicate or obtain the drug without a prescription is strongly discouraged.


### Side Effects
Aurothioglucose carries a significant risk of side effects, which contributed to its decline in use.  These include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Skin rashes, itching, mouth sores, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and changes in blood counts.
* **Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Kidney problems (nephropathy), liver damage, blood disorders (thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis), and severe allergic reactions.  In rare cases, fatal reactions have been reported.

**It is crucial to note:** If any adverse effects occur, medical attention should be sought immediately.  This is especially true for serious side effects like those listed above.


### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action of Aurothioglucose in treating rheumatoid arthritis is not fully understood. However, it's believed that it works through several pathways:  one involves inhibiting protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in inflammatory processes. Another proposed mechanism involves its uptake by macrophages (immune cells), potentially inhibiting their migration and phagocytic activity, thereby suppressing immune responses that contribute to rheumatoid arthritis.

### Precautions
Aurothioglucose has numerous precautions.  Its use is generally contraindicated (should be avoided) in individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver disease, blood disorders, or those with known hypersensitivity to gold compounds.  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is also generally avoided due to the potential risks to the fetus or infant.  Patients should inform their physician of all other medications they are taking, as interactions with other drugs are possible. Regular monitoring of blood counts and kidney and liver function was essential when the drug was used.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is Aurothioglucose still available?**  A:  Aurothioglucose is largely unavailable in many countries. Its use has been discontinued due to the availability of safer and more effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.
* **Q:  What are safer alternatives to Aurothioglucose?** A: Modern treatments for rheumatoid arthritis include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologics, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), all of which offer superior efficacy and a better safety profile.  A rheumatologist can determine the best approach for individual needs.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.
* **Q: Can I store Aurothioglucose at home?** A: Because Aurothioglucose is essentially obsolete, storage information is irrelevant.
