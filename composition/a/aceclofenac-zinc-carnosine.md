# Aceclofenac + Zinc Carnosine

**Generic Name:** Aceclofenac + Zinc Carnosine

**Usage:**  Aceclofenac + Zinc Carnosine is a combination medication used primarily to treat osteoarthritis and other forms of joint pain and inflammation.  Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation, while zinc carnosine is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent believed to help protect cartilage and improve joint health. This combination aims to provide both rapid pain relief (Aceclofenac) and potential long-term joint protection (Zinc Carnosine). It's typically used for the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis pain and inflammation, not to cure the underlying condition.


**Side Effects:**  Like other NSAIDs, Aceclofenac can cause side effects, though the incidence and severity can vary depending on the individual and dosage.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, ulceration (in severe cases).
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased risk of heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure.
* **Central Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness.
* **Renal:**  Fluid retention, kidney problems (especially in those with pre-existing kidney disease).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, swelling, breathing difficulties (rare but serious).

Zinc Carnosine side effects are generally mild and rare, but may include mild gastrointestinal upset.


**How it Works:**

* **Aceclofenac:** This NSAID works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, Aceclofenac helps to alleviate pain and inflammation in the joints.
* **Zinc Carnosine:**  The mechanism of Zinc Carnosine's action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to act as an antioxidant, protecting cartilage from damage caused by free radicals.  It also has anti-inflammatory properties, potentially contributing to reducing joint inflammation and improving joint function.
