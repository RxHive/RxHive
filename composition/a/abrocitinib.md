# Abrocitinib
### Generic Name
Abrocitinib

### Usage
Abrocitinib is a medication primarily used to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults.  It's specifically indicated for those whose condition hasn't responded adequately to other systemic treatments, including biologics, or when such therapies aren't advisable.  It's a targeted therapy working to reduce the inflammation and itching associated with this chronic skin condition.  Currently, it is not approved for use in children.

### Dosage
**Adult Atopic Dermatitis:**  The typical starting dose is 100 mg once daily (OD).  If there's insufficient improvement after 12 weeks, the doctor may increase the dose to 200 mg OD.  If there's still no adequate response after the dose increase, treatment should be discontinued. Abrocitinib can be used with or without topical corticosteroids.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Several factors influence dosage.  Patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B) don't require dose adjustments, but it's not recommended for those with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).  For renal impairment, adjustments are needed.  Mild impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min) doesn't necessitate changes, while moderate impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min) requires starting at 50 mg OD, with potential increase to 100 mg OD after 12 weeks if needed.  Abrocitinib is not recommended for patients with severe or end-stage renal disease (eGFR <29 mL/min) or those on renal replacement therapy.  Individuals who are poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 or are taking strong CYP2C19 inhibitors should also begin with a lower dose (50mg OD), potentially increasing to 100mg OD after 12 weeks if needed.  Treatment should be interrupted or discontinued if serious infections, like serious opportunistic infections, or significant hematologic abnormalities (low platelet, lymphocyte, or neutrophil counts, or low hemoglobin) develop.  Dosage modifications may also be needed in case of such issues.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of abrocitinib haven't been established in children.

**Administration:** Abrocitinib is administered orally. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water; do not crush, split, or chew them.  It can be taken with or without food.

**Serious but Rare Side Effects:** Abrocitinib carries a risk of serious infections (including tuberculosis reactivation), malignancy (including lymphoma), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), thrombosis (blood clots), and death.  These are less common but potentially life-threatening.


**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above as serious or concerning, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Abrocitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.  JAK enzymes play a key role in inflammation.  By inhibiting JAK1, a specific type of JAK enzyme, abrocitinib reduces the inflammatory response that contributes to the symptoms of atopic dermatitis, lessening itching and inflammation in the skin.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Abrocitinib is contraindicated in patients taking antiplatelet therapies (except low-dose aspirin â‰¤81 mg daily) during the first 3 months of treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Abrocitinib interacts with various medications, particularly those affecting CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 enzymes and P-glycoprotein (P-gp).  Consult your doctor about any other medications you're taking to assess potential interactions. This includes the need for dosage adjustments for some medications if used concurrently.
* **Infections:** Abrocitinib increases the risk of serious infections.  Patients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB) before starting treatment and monitored for signs of infection throughout therapy.  Live vaccines should be avoided.
* **Malignancies and Cardiovascular Risks:** Abrocitinib may increase the risk of certain cancers and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).  This is especially pertinent for those with a history of smoking or cardiovascular risk factors.  Regular skin examinations are recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Abrocitinib use during pregnancy is not recommended and there is limited data on its safety and effects on the baby.  Breastfeeding is also discouraged due to potential risks to the infant.
* **Hematologic Monitoring:** Regular blood tests are usually recommended to monitor blood cell counts during abrocitinib therapy.
