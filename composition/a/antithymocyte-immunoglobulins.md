# Antithymocyte immunoglobulins

**Generic Name:**  Antithymocyte globulin (ATG)  *(Note: This is a class of drugs, not a single generic name.  Specific brand names exist, such as  Thymoglobulin® and Atgam®)*

**Usage:**

ATG is used to suppress the immune system.  Its primary uses include:

* **Prevention of rejection in organ transplantation:**  This is its most common use. ATG helps prevent the recipient's immune system from attacking the transplanted organ (kidney, liver, heart, etc.).
* **Treatment of autoimmune diseases:**  In cases where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, ATG can help to dampen this response. Examples include:
    * Aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure)
    * Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
    *  Severe forms of autoimmune diseases like lupus or  myasthenia gravis (occasionally)
* **Treatment of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD):** This is a complication of bone marrow or stem cell transplantation where the donated cells attack the recipient's body.

**Side Effects:**

ATG can cause a wide range of side effects, some mild and others serious.  The severity varies depending on the dose, the patient's overall health, and the specific ATG product used.  Common side effects include:

* **Infections:** This is a major risk due to immune suppression.  Patients are at increased risk for bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections.
* **Fever:** Often an early sign of an infection or other reaction.
* **Chills:** Often associated with fever.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Gastrointestinal upset is common.
* **Headache:**  A relatively common side effect.
* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site.
* **Cytokine release syndrome (CRS):** This can be a serious side effect involving flu-like symptoms, low blood pressure, and organ damage.
* **Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs):**  A potentially life-threatening complication.
* **Serum sickness:**  An allergic reaction that can cause fever, rash, joint pain, and swelling.
* **Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Leukopenia (low white blood cell count):** Increased risk of infection.
* **Lymphopenia (low lymphocyte count):** Further immune suppression.
* **Increased risk of malignancy:** Long-term use can slightly increase the risk of cancer.


**How it Works:**

ATG is a mixture of antibodies that target T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell crucial for the immune response). By binding to these T cells, ATG either directly kills them or marks them for destruction by other immune cells. This significantly reduces the number of active T cells, thereby suppressing the immune system's activity.  This suppression is temporary and the immune system will recover over time.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does ATG treatment last?** The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition being treated. It can range from a few days to several weeks.
* **Are there any alternatives to ATG?** Yes, other immunosuppressant drugs are available, but ATG is often used when other therapies have failed or are not suitable.  The choice depends on the specific clinical situation.
* **What monitoring is required during ATG treatment?** Close monitoring of blood counts (especially white blood cells and platelets), kidney function, and for signs of infection is essential.  Regular blood tests are necessary.
* **Can ATG be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Generally, ATG is avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.
* **What are the long-term effects of ATG?** The long-term effects are generally related to the increased risk of infections and the potential for increased susceptibility to malignancies.  However, many patients experience no long-term complications.
