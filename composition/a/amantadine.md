# Amantadine
### Generic Name
Amantadine

### Usage
Amantadine is primarily used in two distinct ways: as an antiviral medication and as a treatment for Parkinson's disease and related movement disorders.

**Antiviral Use:** Historically, amantadine was used to treat and prevent influenza A infections. However, due to widespread resistance among influenza A strains, its use for this purpose is now largely obsolete and is not recommended by major health organizations like the CDC and AAP.

**Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders:**  In Parkinson's disease, amantadine is used as an adjunctive therapy to manage dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that can occur in patients taking levodopa, a common Parkinson's medication.  It may also be used to treat mild motor symptoms in Parkinson's or as an alternative treatment for drug-induced parkinsonism (symptoms similar to Parkinson's caused by other medications).  It's important to note that amantadine is not a first-line treatment for Parkinson's disease itself; its role is primarily in managing specific side effects or symptoms.  Off-label uses include treating multiple sclerosis-related fatigue, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and tardive dyskinesia, although further research is needed to fully validate its efficacy in these conditions.


### Dosage

Amantadine comes in immediate-release and extended-release forms (tablets, capsules, syrup), and dosages vary significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare provider.  The information below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults:**  Dosage for Parkinson's disease typically starts low and is gradually increased to find the optimal balance between effectiveness and side effects.  Extended-release formulations usually require once-daily dosing, while immediate-release forms may necessitate twice-daily or even more frequent doses.  Intravenous (IV) administration is possible but only in specific situations like acute akinetic crisis and is usually administered by a medical professional.  Dosage ranges differ widely based on the specific indication (Parkinson's, drug-induced parkinsonism, etc.) and formulation. 

**Children:** Amantadine is sometimes used off-label in children for conditions like ADHD and autism.  The dosing in pediatric populations is based on weight and age and is carefully adjusted to minimize side effects.  It is crucial to consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage and monitoring.  Again,  dosages for influenza A are no longer recommended due to resistance.

**Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are critical in patients with impaired kidney function because amantadine is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.  Lower doses or less frequent dosing are necessary to avoid accumulation and toxicity.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):

* Dizziness
* Hallucinations
* Delusions
* Insomnia
* Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)
* Constipation
* Dry mouth
* Livedo reticularis (a skin condition)


Less common but serious side effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) â€“ a life-threatening condition
* Suicidal ideation or behavior
* QT interval prolongation (risk of abnormal heart rhythms)

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, immediate medical attention should be sought.


### How it Works

**Antiviral Action:** Amantadine interferes with the M2 protein of the influenza A virus, preventing the virus from entering and replicating within host cells.  Its effectiveness has been significantly diminished by the emergence of resistant strains.

**Antiparkinsonian Action:** The exact mechanism isn't completely understood, but amantadine is thought to work through several pathways, including its action as a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and potential effects on dopamine release. While not directly anticholinergic, it can cause anticholinergic-like side effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Amantadine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or severe renal impairment.  IV administration has additional contraindications related to cardiovascular health.
* **Drug Interactions:** Amantadine can interact with numerous other drugs, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness or leading to adverse effects.  Healthcare providers should be informed of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of amantadine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally discouraged unless the potential benefits significantly outweigh the risks.  Amantadine is excreted in breast milk.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults are more susceptible to amantadine's side effects, particularly those affecting the nervous system and cardiovascular system.  Careful monitoring and dose adjustment are essential.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Dose adjustment is critical in patients with renal impairment.  Caution is advised in those with liver problems.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I stop taking amantadine suddenly?**

A: No, abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including confusion and hyperpyrexia (high fever).  The dose should be tapered gradually under medical supervision.

**Q: How should I store amantadine?**

A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

**Q: Is amantadine effective against influenza B?**

A: No, amantadine has minimal or no effect against influenza B.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.

**Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking amantadine?**

A: Because amantadine can cause dizziness and drowsiness, avoid activities requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.
