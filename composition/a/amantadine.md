# Amantadine

**Generic Name:** Amantadine

**Usage:**

Amantadine is primarily used to treat:

* **Influenza A virus infection:**  While resistance is now widespread, it may still be used in some cases (primarily for prophylaxis, or prevention, in high-risk individuals) if the strain is susceptible and other treatments are not tolerated or available.  It's important to note that its effectiveness against influenza is limited and has been largely superseded by other antiviral medications.
* **Parkinson's disease:**  Amantadine is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, particularly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow movement).  It's often used as an adjunctive therapy, meaning it's used in addition to other Parkinson's medications.  It can also help reduce dyskinesia (involuntary movements) associated with levodopa therapy.
* **Drug-induced parkinsonism:** Amantadine can also be used to treat Parkinson-like symptoms caused by certain medications.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:**  These are often mild and can subside with continued use.
* **Dizziness and lightheadedness:** These can be more pronounced in older adults and those with pre-existing conditions.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty sleeping is a relatively common side effect.
* **Ankle swelling:** Fluid retention can lead to swelling in the ankles.
* **Constipation:** Reduced bowel movements.
* **Headache:** Mild to moderate headaches are possible.
* **Confusion and hallucinations:** These are more likely to occur in older adults or those with cognitive impairment.
* **Drowsiness and fatigue:**  Feeling tired and sleepy.
* **Livido reticularis (lace-like purplish discoloration of the skin):** This is a relatively uncommon but characteristic side effect.


Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* **Severe skin reactions:**  These can be life-threatening.
* **Seizures:**  Individuals with epilepsy or a history of seizures should use caution.
* **Psychotic symptoms:** Worsening of existing psychosis or new-onset psychosis.
* **Cardiovascular issues:** Such as irregular heartbeat.


**How it Works:**

The mechanism of action differs depending on the condition being treated:

* **Influenza A:**  Amantadine blocks the M2 protein ion channel on the influenza A virus, preventing viral uncoating and replication within the host cell.
* **Parkinson's Disease:**  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to increase the release of dopamine and/or block the reuptake of dopamine in the brain.  This leads to improved motor function.

**FAQs:**

* **Is amantadine addictive?**  Amantadine is not considered addictive in the same way as opioids or other substances of abuse, however, abrupt cessation after long-term use can lead to withdrawal symptoms.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking amantadine?**  Alcohol can exacerbate side effects like dizziness and drowsiness, so it's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking amantadine.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can amantadine be taken with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting amantadine, as interactions are possible.
* **Is amantadine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  The safety of amantadine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before taking it.
