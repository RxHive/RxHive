# Ammonium Citrate
### Generic Name
Ammonium Citrate

### Usage
Ammonium citrate itself isn't a medication used to treat specific medical conditions like a typical drug.  It's primarily used as an inactive ingredient in pharmaceutical formulations.  Its role is often as a buffering agent, helping to stabilize the pH of a solution, or as an excipient â€“ a substance included to improve the drug's physical properties, like its solubility or flowability during manufacturing.  You won't find ammonium citrate listed as a treatment for a disease on its own; rather, it's a component *within* medications.  In some food applications, it's used as an indirect food additive, particularly in adhesives that might come into contact with food packaging.

### Dosage
There's no standard dosage for ammonium citrate as a standalone medication because it isn't one.  The amount used depends entirely on its role within a specific pharmaceutical product and is determined by the pharmaceutical manufacturer based on the drug's formulation and intended use.  A doctor or pharmacist would never prescribe "ammonium citrate" as a treatment; they would prescribe a medication *containing* ammonium citrate as an inactive ingredient.

### Side Effects
Since ammonium citrate is not a drug taken on its own, side effects are not directly attributable to it in isolation.  Any potential side effects would be related to the specific medication it's a part of, and those would be listed in that medication's information.  However, it is important to note that ammonium citrate can be irritating to the skin and eyes and should be handled with care.  Ingestion of large amounts could lead to gastrointestinal upset.

### How it Works
Ammonium citrate's mechanism of action depends entirely on its use within a larger pharmaceutical formulation. As a buffer, it helps maintain a consistent pH level.  As an excipient, it assists in the manufacturing process and may affect the drug's properties, ensuring it dissolves correctly or flows smoothly during production.  It does not have a direct therapeutic effect on the body itself.

### Precautions
Ammonium citrate is considered a relatively low-risk substance when used in regulated quantities within pharmaceutical preparations. However, direct contact with skin or eyes should be avoided.  Large doses ingested can cause digestive issues.  People with pre-existing kidney conditions should exercise caution, as ammonium citrate's metabolism involves the kidneys.  Always refer to the specific medication's information regarding safety and precautions.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, and individuals with underlying health concerns, should consult their healthcare provider before taking any medication containing ammonium citrate.
