# Antazoline + Naphazoline
### Generic Name
Antazoline + Naphazoline

### Usage

Antazoline and naphazoline, when combined, primarily treat the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva in the eye, causing redness, itching, and watery eyes) and nasal congestion (stuffiness or blocked nasal passages).  The combination medication works by addressing both the allergic reaction (Antazoline) and the vascular congestion (Naphazoline) contributing to these symptoms.  While not always explicitly labeled for this, it's understood that the combination is effective in reducing symptoms related to allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and other similar conditions.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Allergic Conjunctivitis (Ophthalmic):**  1-2 drops of a 0.05% solution in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours.  Combination products containing Antazoline and Naphazoline (or similar formulations like Xylometazoline and Antazoline) are typically used.
* **Nasal Congestion (Intranasal):** 1-2 drops in each nostril twice daily (BID) for a maximum of 3 days.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Allergic Conjunctivitis (Ophthalmic):** Generally not recommended for children under 12 years old.
* **Nasal Congestion (Intranasal):** Children aged 6-12 years: 1 drop in each nostril once daily (OD) for a maximum of 3 days.  Adolescents can typically use the adult dose.


**Important Note:**  Always follow the specific instructions on the product label.  The strength of the solution and exact dosage recommendations may vary slightly depending on the brand and formulation.  Combination therapy (using Antazoline + Naphazoline) is usually preferred over using either medication alone.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes (ophthalmic use), temporary blurred vision.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased intraocular pressure (eye pressure), mydriasis (pupil dilation), allergic dermatitis (skin rash), cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), hypertension (high blood pressure), drowsiness, and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar, primarily with nasal use).


If any adverse effects occur, especially the serious ones listed above, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Antazoline is an antihistamine.  It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. By blocking histamine, Antazoline helps to reduce the itching, redness, and swelling associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

Naphazoline is a decongestant that acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist.  It constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages and conjunctiva, reducing swelling and relieving nasal congestion and eye redness.  The combined effect provides relief from both the allergic response and the associated inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Antazoline, Naphazoline, or any of the formulation's ingredients.  It's also contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma (for ophthalmic use), when used with contact lenses (ophthalmic use), and generally in young children (ophthalmic use).
* **Cautions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, those taking MAO inhibitors, elderly individuals, and patients with infections, injuries, or dry eyes.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult a doctor before using it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:**  Potentially dangerous interactions could occur when this medication is used with MAO inhibitors (monoamine oxidase inhibitors).

### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I use this medication?** A:  Generally, for nasal congestion, use is limited to 3 days maximum. Consult your doctor for longer-term use.  For ophthalmic use, consult your physician or follow the recommendations on the product label.
* **Q: Can I use this with other eye drops?** A:  Maintain a 5-minute interval if using with other eye drops. Consult your doctor or pharmacist to ensure no harmful interactions will occur.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, use it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct heat and light.  Discard ophthalmic solutions after 4 weeks of opening the container.
* **Q: Is this medication safe for contact lens wearers?** A:  No. Contact lens wearers should remove their lenses before application and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them.  Contact lenses should not be inserted if eyes remain red.
