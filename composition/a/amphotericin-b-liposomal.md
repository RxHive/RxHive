# Amphotericin B Liposomal
### Generic Name
Amphotericin B Liposomal

### Usage
Amphotericin B liposomal is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication used to treat serious and life-threatening invasive fungal infections.  It's particularly valuable when other antifungal drugs have failed or are unsuitable.  The primary use is in treating systemic infections caused by various fungi, including *Aspergillus* species, *Candida* species, and *Cryptococcus* species.  Secondary uses extend to treating less common fungal infections like coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, leishmaniasis (visceral, cutaneous, and mucosal), and infections related to contaminated steroid products (e.g., meningitis, osteoarticular infections).  Its use in these secondary indications is often off-label, meaning it's not officially approved for these conditions by regulatory agencies but is used based on clinical experience and research.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, renal function, and overall health.  It is crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.  Amphotericin B liposomal is administered intravenously (IV).

**Adults:** The typical dose ranges from 3 to 5 mg/kg per day, given as a single daily infusion. However,  doses may be higher (up to 7.5 mg/kg/day) for certain severe infections like central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The duration of treatment is highly variable, ranging from several weeks to months, depending on the response to treatment and the type of infection.

**Children:** Dosage for children also ranges from 3 to 5 mg/kg per day, administered as a single daily infusion.  Higher doses might be needed for severe infections.  Pediatric dosing requires careful calculation and close monitoring by a physician.

**Important Note:**  Lipid-based formulations like liposomal amphotericin B are *not* interchangeable with conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate and have different dosing recommendations.  Never switch between these formulations without consulting a doctor.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fever and chills (infusion-related reactions)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Headache
* Hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Kidney problems (nephrotoxicity)


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

*  Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*  Acute renal failure
*  Cardiac arrhythmias
*  Blood disorders (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Amphotericin B liposomal works by targeting the cell membranes of fungi. It binds to ergosterol, a component of fungal cell membranes, creating pores or channels. This disrupts the membrane's integrity, allowing essential ions and molecules to leak out of the fungal cells, eventually leading to their death.  The liposomal formulation helps reduce the drug's toxicity compared to conventional amphotericin B by encapsulating it in a lipid (fatty) vesicle, which protects cells in the body while still allowing delivery to the fungal cells.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Amphotericin B liposomal is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in patients with a known allergy to amphotericin B or any components of the formulation.
* **Renal Function:**  Monitor kidney function closely during treatment, as nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) is a potential risk. Prehydration with intravenous fluids may help mitigate this risk.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:**  Regularly monitor serum electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, due to the potential for electrolyte disturbances.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking, as interactions may occur.  Some medications can increase the risk of side effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Amphotericin B crosses the placenta. Use during pregnancy is only warranted when the benefits outweigh the risks.  The safety of use during breastfeeding is unknown.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions are common.  Premedication with antipyretics (fever reducers), antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids may be used to reduce the incidence and severity of these reactions.  The infusion should be slowed or stopped if significant reactions occur.
