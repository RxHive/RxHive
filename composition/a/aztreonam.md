# Aztreonam

**Generic Name:** Aztreonam

**Usage:** Aztreonam is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those caused by gram-negative bacteria.  These infections may affect the:

* **Respiratory tract:** Pneumonia, bronchitis
* **Skin and soft tissues:** Abscesses, cellulitis
* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Infections within the abdomen
* **Septicemia (bloodstream infections)**
* **Gynecological infections:** Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
* **Meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord)**  *Often used in combination with other antibiotics*
* **Neutropenic fever** (fever in patients with low white blood cell counts)


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, aztreonam can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching
* **Injection site reactions (if administered intravenously or intramuscularly):** Pain, redness, swelling
* **Less common but more serious side effects:**  These require immediate medical attention and include allergic reactions (such as hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), seizures, and changes in blood counts.


**How it Works:** Aztreonam is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the production of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By disrupting cell wall synthesis, aztreonam prevents bacteria from multiplying and eventually leads to their death. It is specifically effective against gram-negative bacteria because it targets the unique structure of their outer membrane.  It does *not* affect gram-positive bacteria.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is aztreonam effective against all bacterial infections?** A: No, aztreonam is primarily effective against gram-negative bacteria. It's ineffective against gram-positive bacteria and many other types of microorganisms.
* **Q: Can I take aztreonam with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions with other drugs are possible.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
