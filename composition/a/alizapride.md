# Alizapride
### Generic Name
Alizapride

### Usage
Alizapride is primarily used to treat nausea and vomiting. This includes postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), meaning nausea and vomiting that occur after surgery.  It's also used to manage nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy.  While not its primary indication, alizapride's prokinetic properties (meaning it improves gut motility) may offer some benefit in certain gastrointestinal disorders, although this is not a common or widely accepted use.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Nausea and Vomiting (Oral):**  75-300 mg per day, divided into multiple doses. The exact dosage will depend on the severity of the symptoms and individual response.
* **Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (Intravenous/Intramuscular):** 2-5 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses. The first dose is typically given 30 minutes before chemotherapy, and the second dose 4-8 hours afterward.  For highly emetogenic chemotherapy (chemotherapy that is very likely to cause vomiting), higher doses may be needed and given via slow IV infusion. The maximum dose per course of chemotherapy is 4.5 grams.  A healthcare professional will determine the specific dosing regimen.

**Children:**

* **Nausea and Vomiting (Oral):** 5 mg/kg/day.  The dosage and frequency should always be determined by a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using alizapride in patients with kidney problems.  Always consult a doctor before administering alizapride in individuals with compromised liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Diarrhea

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:

* Extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements)
* Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation)
* Galactorrhea (inappropriate milk production)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Alizapride works by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain. The CTZ plays a vital role in triggering nausea and vomiting. By blocking dopamine's action in this area, alizapride prevents the signals that lead to these symptoms.  Its similar structure to metoclopramide suggests similar mechanisms for influencing gut motility as well, although its primary function remains antiemetic.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Alizapride is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to alizapride or related compounds, pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia (a movement disorder) from neuroleptic use, Parkinson's disease, during pregnancy, and in conditions where increased gastrointestinal motility is undesirable (e.g., gastrointestinal perforation or partial bowel obstruction).
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) depression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and hyperprolactinemia (high prolactin levels).
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Always inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, as alizapride may interact with other drugs, potentially leading to adverse effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Alizapride is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, breastfeeding while using alizapride is not recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking alizapride?** A: No.  Alizapride may cause drowsiness and dizziness, impairing your ability to drive or operate machinery.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking alizapride?** A: No. Alcohol can worsen the side effects of alizapride, including drowsiness and dizziness.
* **Q: How should I store alizapride?** A: Store alizapride as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice on missed doses. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Is alizapride suitable for long-term use?** A: The duration of treatment with alizapride depends on the specific condition being treated and should be determined by your healthcare provider.  It's generally not intended for long-term use unless specifically indicated.
