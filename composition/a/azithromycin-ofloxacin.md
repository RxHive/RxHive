# Azithromycin + Ofloxacin

**Generic Name:** Azithromycin + Ofloxacin

**Usage:**  Azithromycin + Ofloxacin combination is not a standard, pre-formulated generic medication.  Azithromycin and Ofloxacin are frequently prescribed *separately* for treating various bacterial infections, often overlapping in their efficacy against certain pathogens.  A doctor might prescribe them together in specific cases, typically based on a patient's unique infection and antibiotic susceptibility testing.  Possible uses for a *concurrent* prescription (not a combined drug) might include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Pneumonia, bronchitis (especially when caused by bacteria susceptible to both antibiotics).
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:**  Abscesses, cellulitis (again, only when the causative bacteria are susceptible).
* **Genitourinary infections:**  Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), though this would usually require specific testing to determine suitability.

**It is crucial to understand that this combination is NOT a standard formulation and should only be used under strict medical supervision.**  The doctor will tailor the dosage and duration of both drugs individually based on the patient's specific condition.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects listed below are for *individual* use of Azithromycin and Ofloxacin.  The combination may lead to a higher incidence or severity of these effects.  Always report any side effects to your doctor.

* **Azithromycin:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), liver problems (rare but serious).
* **Ofloxacin:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, insomnia, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), tendonitis or tendon rupture (rare but serious), seizures (rare but serious).


**How it Works:**

* **Azithromycin:**  A macrolide antibiotic. It works by binding to the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and preventing bacterial growth.  It has a broad spectrum of activity against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
* **Ofloxacin:** A fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, thereby preventing bacterial growth.  It also has a broad spectrum of activity.
