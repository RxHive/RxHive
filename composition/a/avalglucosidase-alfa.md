# Avalglucosidase Alfa
### Generic Name
Avalglucosidase Alfa

### Usage

Avalglucosidase alfa is a prescription medicine used to treat late-onset Pompe disease in patients aged 1 year and older.  Pompe disease is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This enzyme deficiency leads to a buildup of glycogen, a type of sugar, in the body's cells, particularly in muscles.  The accumulation of glycogen causes progressive muscle weakness and damage, affecting various bodily functions depending on the disease's severity and the age of onset. Late-onset Pompe disease typically manifests later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, and symptoms can vary widely between individuals.  Avalglucosidase alfa works by replacing the missing or deficient GAA enzyme, helping to break down the accumulated glycogen and alleviate the symptoms of the disease.

### Dosage

The dosage of avalglucosidase alfa is determined by the patient's actual body weight and is administered intravenously (IV).  It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for precise dosage instructions, as they will tailor the treatment to the individual's needs.  Generally:

* **Patients weighing less than 30 kg:** The typical dose is 40 mg/kg every two weeks.
* **Patients weighing 30 kg or more:** The typical dose is 20 mg/kg every two weeks.

Children and adolescents follow the same weight-based dosage guidelines.  Before each infusion, pre-treatment with antihistamines, antipyretics (fever reducers), and/or corticosteroids may be considered to minimize the risk of infusion-related reactions. The healthcare provider will determine the appropriate pre-treatment regimen.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Hypersensitivity reactions (ranging from mild to severe, including anaphylaxis)
* Infusion-related reactions (varying in severity)
* Antibody development

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may involve:

* Chills
* Dizziness
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Skin reactions (rash, itching, redness)
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Muscle aches (myalgia)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Fever

Any serious side effects, particularly hypersensitivity reactions or severe infusion reactions, require immediate medical attention.  Consult a healthcare professional immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Avalglucosidase alfa is a recombinant human GAA enzyme. It functions by replacing the missing or insufficient GAA enzyme in individuals with Pompe disease.  The enzyme has a mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) tag, which allows it to bind to receptors on the surface of cells. This binding facilitates the enzyme's entry into the cell's lysosomes, the cellular compartments responsible for waste breakdown. Once inside the lysosome, avalglucosidase alfa breaks down the accumulated glycogen, reducing its levels and improving muscle function.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Avalglucosidase alfa carries a boxed warning for hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction).  Medical personnel must be prepared to manage such reactions.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion-related reactions are common.  Close monitoring during and after infusions is essential.
* **Cardiorespiratory Risk:** Patients with underlying cardiac or respiratory conditions, or those susceptible to fluid overload, may be at increased risk of complications. Careful monitoring is crucial for these individuals.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of avalglucosidase alfa during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult a healthcare provider to discuss the risks and benefits.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Currently, no significant drug interactions are known, but it's always essential to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is avalglucosidase alfa administered?**  A: It's administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: Treatment is usually long-term, and the duration depends on the individual's response and condition.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss rescheduling.
* **Q: How should I store avalglucosidase alfa?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking this medication?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions associated with avalglucosidase alfa, but maintaining a healthy diet is always advisable.
* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking this medication?** A: Fatigue is a potential side effect.  If you experience fatigue, avoid activities requiring alertness until the effect subsides.
