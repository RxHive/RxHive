# Alpha Lipoic Acid
### Generic Name
Alpha Lipoic Acid

### Usage
Alpha lipoic acid (ALA), also known as thioctic acid, is primarily used to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a type of nerve damage that often affects people with diabetes.  It's believed to help by improving nerve function and reducing oxidative stress, which contributes to nerve damage. While its main application is in diabetic neuropathy, some research suggests potential benefits in other conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and Alzheimer's disease; however, more research is needed to confirm these applications.  It is important to note that ALA is not a first-line treatment for these conditions and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the formulation and route of administration. Always follow your doctor's prescription.

* **Diabetic Neuropathy (Intravenous):** For severe symptoms, an initial intravenous dose of 600 mg daily may be given.  This is typically transitioned to oral therapy after 2-4 weeks.
* **Diabetic Neuropathy (Oral):** Dosages vary by formulation. Some common oral formulations include:
    * Alpha lipoic acid hyper-release formulation: 600 mg daily.
    * R-Alpha lipoic acid tromethamine: 480 mg daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Alpha lipoic acid is **not** recommended for use in children and adolescents.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always discuss any existing medical conditions with your doctor before starting ALA treatment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency not defined):**

* Nervous system:  Hypoesthesia (reduced sensation), neuralgia (nerve pain), paresthesia (abnormal sensation), seizure (rare).
* Dermatologic: Cheilosis (cracking of the lips).
* Gastrointestinal: Anorexia (loss of appetite).
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain).
* Respiratory: Cough, dry throat, nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat).


**Less Common Side Effects (<1%):**

* Dermatologic: Ecchymoses (bruising), eczema, pruritus (itching), skin rash, urticaria (hives).
* Endocrine and metabolic: Decreased serum glucose level.
* Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, dysgeusia (altered taste), gastrointestinal pain, nausea, vomiting.
* Hematologic: Platelet disorder.
* Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity reaction.
* Local (Injection site): Injection-site reaction.
* Ophthalmic (Injection): Diplopia (double vision).
* Respiratory: Respiratory distress (especially with rapid intravenous injection).
* Other: Fever.

**Post-marketing reports:**  Additional side effects have been reported after the drug's release, including dizziness, headache, edema (swelling), weight loss, and various gastrointestinal issues.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Alpha lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant and plays a role in glucose metabolism.  In the context of diabetic neuropathy, it's believed to work through several mechanisms:

* **Antioxidant Activity:** It scavenges harmful free radicals, reducing oxidative stress that contributes to nerve damage.
* **Improved Glucose Uptake:** ALA may enhance the ability of muscle cells to take up glucose, improving insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes.
* **Regeneration of Other Antioxidants:** ALA can regenerate other antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin E, extending their protective effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  ALA is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to ALA or any of its components, and in children and adolescents.
* **Drug Interactions:** ALA may interact with certain medications, particularly those that affect blood sugar levels. Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of ALA use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Discuss the potential risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Glucose Metabolism:** ALA can lower blood glucose levels.  Individuals with diabetes should monitor their blood glucose closely while using ALA, and adjust their diabetes medication as needed under their doctor's guidance.
* **Intravenous Administration:** Rapid intravenous injection may lead to serious side effects like respiratory distress.  Intravenous administration should be done slowly, ideally using a syringe pump.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Alpha lipoic acid with other supplements?**  A:  Itâ€™s important to discuss any supplements you are considering taking with your healthcare professional.  Some supplements might interact negatively with ALA.

* **Q: How should I store Alpha lipoic acid?** A: Store ALA according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Will Alpha lipoic acid cure my diabetic neuropathy?** A: ALA may help manage symptoms and slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy, but it is not a cure.

* **Q: How long will it take to see results?** A:  The timeframe for noticing improvements varies greatly depending on the individual and the severity of the condition. It is important to have patience and to continue the treatment as prescribed by your doctor.


* **Q:  Can Alpha lipoic acid cause a change in my urine odor?** A: Yes, this is a known side effect.  The change in odor is generally temporary and considered harmless.
