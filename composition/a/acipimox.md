# Acipimox

**Generic Name:** Acipimox

**Usage:** Acipimox is used to lower triglyceride levels in the blood in people with very high triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia).  It's typically used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise, not as a standalone treatment.  It's *not* used to treat high cholesterol (high LDL or total cholesterol).  Its use is often reserved for patients who haven't responded adequately to lifestyle changes or other medications.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects of acipimox are generally mild and include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn.
* **Skin reactions:** Rash, itching.
* **Headache:**  May occur in some patients.
* **Elevated Liver Enzymes:**  In some cases, acipimox can temporarily raise liver enzymes, requiring monitoring of liver function.  This is usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  While rare, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is a serious potential side effect that requires immediate medical attention.

**How it Works:** Acipimox is a nicotinic acid derivative.  It works by inhibiting the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (fat stores) into the bloodstream. This reduction in free fatty acids leads to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. The exact mechanism isn't completely understood, but it's believed to involve influencing the activity of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is acipimox a first-line treatment for high triglycerides?** A: No, lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight loss) are usually the first line of treatment. Acipimox is typically reserved for those who don't respond adequately to these changes.  Other medications like fibrates may also be considered before acipimox.
* **Q: Does acipimox lower cholesterol?** A: No, acipimox primarily lowers triglycerides. It may have a minimal effect on some cholesterol levels, but it's not a primary treatment for high cholesterol.
* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions with acipimox?** A:  Acipimox can interact with several medications, including some diabetes medications and blood thinners.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results from acipimox?** A:  The reduction in triglyceride levels typically occurs gradually over several weeks of treatment.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially severe gastrointestinal problems or signs of pancreatitis (severe abdominal pain).
