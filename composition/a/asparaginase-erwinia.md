# Asparaginase (Erwinia)
### Generic Name
Asparaginase (Erwinia)

### Usage

Asparaginase (Erwinia) is an enzyme used in chemotherapy. Its primary purpose is to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  It's specifically indicated for patients who have an allergy to asparaginase derived from *Escherichia coli*.  This means it serves as an alternative to other forms of asparaginase when those are unsuitable.  It's always used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, not as a standalone treatment.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Asparaginase (Erwinia) is not interchangeable with other asparaginase products (like those derived from *E. coli*, pegaspargase, or calaspargase pegol).  Dosage and administration must be carefully determined by a healthcare professional. Thromboprophylaxis (prevention of blood clots) with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is often recommended during treatment, especially for high-risk patients.  However, LMWH should be withheld if the platelet count drops below 30,000/mm³.

Dosage varies significantly depending on whether it's replacing *E. coli* asparaginase or pegaspargase and the patient's age and size.  Both intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) administration routes are possible. For IV administration, monitoring of serum asparaginase activity levels is often recommended; if levels are inadequate, a switch to IM administration might be considered.

* **As a substitute for *E. coli* asparaginase:**  25,000 units/m² per scheduled dose of *E. coli* asparaginase.  This applies to both adults and children and adolescents.
* **As a substitute for pegaspargase:** 25,000 units/m² three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for six doses, replacing each planned pegaspargase dose. This applies to both adults and children and adolescents.
* **Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) induction (pediatric):**  Infants, children, and adolescents under 14 years old may receive 6,000 units/m² three times a week for nine doses, starting on day 4 of week 1. This is given in combination with other chemotherapy drugs (allopurinol, vincristine, prednisone, methotrexate, and daunorubicin).


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):

* Nausea and vomiting
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (serum transaminases)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Antibody development

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% or less):

* Thrombosis (blood clots)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Abdominal pain, diarrhea, stomatitis (mouth sores)
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin levels)
* Fever
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Hyperammonemia (high ammonia levels)
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke) – frequency not well defined
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) and sagittal sinus thrombosis (blood clot in the brain) – post-marketing reports


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

### How it Works

Asparaginase is an enzyme that breaks down asparagine, an amino acid.  Leukemia cells often lack the ability to produce their own asparagine, making them dependent on the body's supply. By reducing the amount of circulating asparagine, asparaginase deprives leukemia cells of this essential nutrient, leading to their death.  This is a targeted approach, meaning it affects cancer cells more than normal cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Asparaginase (Erwinia) is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) to this medicine or any of its components; those with a history of serious pancreatitis, thrombosis, or hemorrhagic events from prior asparaginase treatment; and pregnant or potentially pregnant women.
* **Interactions:** Asparaginase can increase blood levels of dexamethasone (a corticosteroid).
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Effective contraception is essential during and for three months after treatment. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for three months afterward.
* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring of blood counts, liver function, blood sugar, and other parameters is crucial. Patients should be carefully observed for signs of pancreatitis, thrombosis, or bleeding.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Asparaginase (Erwinia) stored?** A:  Storage instructions should be followed carefully, as provided by the manufacturer. Generally, this involves refrigeration.

* **Q: Can I take other medications with Asparaginase (Erwinia)?** A:  It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions can occur.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Never adjust your dosage without consulting your doctor.  Missed doses should be addressed based on your doctor's instructions.

* **Q:  How long will I be on Asparaginase (Erwinia)?** A: The duration of treatment varies greatly depending on the individual's condition and response to the therapy.

* **Q: Are there alternative treatments available?**  A:  Yes, there are other types of asparaginase and other chemotherapy regimens that may be used.  Your oncologist will determine the best approach for you.
