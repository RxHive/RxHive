# Aliskiren
### Generic Name
Aliskiren

### Usage
Aliskiren is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  It's a direct renin inhibitor, meaning it works by blocking the renin enzyme, a key player in the body's system that regulates blood pressure.  This, in turn, lowers blood pressure.  Currently, it does not have notable secondary uses beyond hypertension management.

### Dosage

**Adults (Hypertension):**

*   The typical starting dose is 150 mg once daily, taken with or without food, though consistency in relation to meals is recommended.
*   The dose may be increased to a maximum of 300 mg once daily if blood pressure remains uncontrolled.

**Children (Hypertension):**  (Note:  Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 6 years old.)

*   **Children aged 6 years and older, weighing 20-50 kg:** The starting dose is 75 mg once daily.  This can be increased to 150 mg once daily if blood pressure is not adequately controlled.  The maximum dose is 150 mg daily.
*   **Children aged 6 years and older, weighing 50 kg or more:** The dosage is the same as for adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment:** No initial dosage adjustment is usually necessary.
*   **Renal Impairment:**  For creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min, no initial dosage adjustment is necessary. For CrCl < 30 mL/min, and for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis,  dosage adjustments are not specifically defined in manufacturer labeling; use with extreme caution and under close medical supervision.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Skin rash
*   Diarrhea
*   Increased creatine phosphokinase levels
*   Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels
*   Cough

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**  These are based on post-marketing surveillance and case reports.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these:

*   Abdominal pain
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Anemia
*   Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
*   Decreased hematocrit or hemoglobin
*   Dyspepsia (indigestion)
*   Erythema (redness of the skin)
*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*   Gout
*   Hepatic insufficiency (liver failure)
*   Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
*   Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
*   Increased liver enzyme levels
*   Increased uric acid levels
*   Myositis (muscle inflammation)
*   Nausea
*   Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)
*   Periorbital edema (swelling around the eyes)
*   Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
*   Pruritus (itching)
*   Rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue)
*   Seizures
*   Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reaction)
*   Urticaria (hives)
*   Vomiting


### How it Works

Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor.  Renin is an enzyme that plays a vital role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. Aliskiren directly inhibits renin, preventing the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.  This subsequently reduces the formation of angiotensin II and aldosterone, powerful hormones that constrict blood vessels and increase fluid retention. By decreasing these hormones, aliskiren lowers blood pressure.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Allergy to aliskiren or any ingredient in the formulation.
*   Concurrent use with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in patients with diabetes or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m².
*   Children under 6 years old.
*   History of angioedema (swelling) following treatment with aliskiren, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs.
*   Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.
*   Pregnancy (Category C in the first trimester; Category D in the second and third trimesters; may cause fetal harm).
*   Breastfeeding (excretion in breast milk is unknown).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

*   Use with caution in patients with volume depletion, hyponatremia, a history of angioedema, renal impairment, or severe congestive heart failure.
*   Monitor for angioedema and hypotension, especially at the start of treatment, when changing doses, and regularly throughout therapy.
*   Increased risk of symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and angioedema), and renal effects, including acute renal failure.  
*   Aliskiren can cause fetal harm, so it must be discontinued immediately if pregnancy is detected.


**Drug Interactions:**  Aliskiren's effects can be significantly altered by other medications.  Important interactions include those with:

*   ACE inhibitors
*   Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)
*   Other antihypertensives
*   MAO inhibitors
*   NSAIDs
*   Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors
*   Prostacyclin analogues

Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take aliskiren with food?** A: Yes, aliskiren can be taken with or without food, but consistency is recommended. High-fat meals can reduce absorption.

*   **Q: How should I store aliskiren?** A: Store aliskiren as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

*   **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking aliskiren?** A: No, it's best to avoid grapefruit juice while taking aliskiren as it can interact with the medication and affect its effectiveness.

*   **Q: Can I take potassium supplements while taking aliskiren?** A: No, avoid potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium while taking aliskiren to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).

*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or concerning.
