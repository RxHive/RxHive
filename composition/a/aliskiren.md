# Aliskiren

**Generic Name:** Aliskiren

**Usage:** Aliskiren is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's often used in combination with other blood pressure medications, particularly when other medications alone haven't been effective enough in controlling blood pressure.  It is *not* recommended for use in patients with diabetes or kidney disease.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, aliskiren can cause side effects.  Common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea**
* **Nausea**
* **Vomiting**
* **Dizziness**
* **Headache**
* **Muscle cramps**
* **Fatigue**
* **Upper respiratory infection**

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)**  This is especially important to monitor in patients with kidney problems.
* **Allergic reactions** (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* **Angioedema** (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* **Kidney problems** (worsening of existing kidney disease)

**How it Works:** Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor.  Renin is an enzyme in the body that plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This system regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. By inhibiting renin, aliskiren reduces the production of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels and increases blood pressure.  This leads to lower blood pressure.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take aliskiren with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible, particularly with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and other medications that affect potassium levels.  Combining aliskiren with an ACE inhibitor or ARB is generally not recommended due to increased risk of kidney problems and hyperkalemia.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking aliskiren?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally alright, but excessive alcohol intake can worsen blood pressure and interact negatively with the medication.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, angioedema, or significant changes in kidney function.
* **Q: Is aliskiren safe for pregnant women?** A: No, aliskiren is not recommended during pregnancy because it can harm the developing fetus.  Alternative blood pressure medications should be considered.
* **Q: Can aliskiren cause weight gain?** A: While not a common side effect, some individuals may experience weight gain or changes in appetite.
* **Q: How long does it take for aliskiren to work?** A: It may take several weeks to see the full effect of aliskiren on blood pressure.  Regular monitoring is necessary.
