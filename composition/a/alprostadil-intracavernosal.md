# Alprostadil Intracavernosal
### Generic Name
Alprostadil Intracavernosal

### Usage

Alprostadil, specifically in its intracavernosal form, is primarily used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED).  This means it helps men achieve and maintain an erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse.  The underlying cause of the ED can be vascular (related to blood vessels), psychogenic (related to psychological factors), neurogenic (related to nerve damage), or a mix of these.  Alprostadil can also be administered intraurethrally (via a suppository inserted into the urethra), though this route is less commonly used.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's response and the route of administration.

* **Intracavernosal Injection:**  The initial dose is typically 2.5 mcg for vascular, psychogenic, or mixed etiology ED, and 1.25 mcg for neurogenic ED. The dose is then carefully titrated upward (in small increments of 2.5-10 mcg) until an erection suitable for intercourse (lasting under 1 hour) is achieved.  The maximum frequency is less than 3 times per week, with at least 24 hours between doses.  Self-administration is possible after proper training.

* **Intraurethral Suppository:**  The dosage range is 125-1000 mcg.  Treatment typically starts with 125-250 mcg, adjusted until the erection lasts for approximately 30-60 minutes. No more than two suppositories should be used within 24 hours.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Alprostadil intracavernosal is not indicated for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Manufacturer labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with renal (kidney) or hepatic (liver) impairment.  Always consult a physician for guidance in these cases.


### Side Effects

The side effects of Alprostadil vary depending on the route of administration.

**Intracavernosal Injection:**

* **Common (≥10%):** Penile pain
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Prolonged erection (4-6 hours), penile fibrosis, injection site hematoma, ecchymosis (bruising), rash, and edema (swelling).
* **Rare (<1%):** Priapism (prolonged, painful erection lasting more than 6 hours—a medical emergency), injection site hemorrhage.

**Intraurethral Suppository:**

* **Common (≥10%):** Penile pain, urethral burning
* **Less Common (1-10%):** Urethral bleeding, testicular pain, headache
* **Rare (<1%):** Syncope (fainting), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), leg pain, perineal pain

Any persistent or worsening side effects should be reported immediately to a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Alprostadil is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the penis's blood vessels, causing the arteries to widen. This increases blood flow into the corpora cavernosa (the erectile tissue of the penis), leading to an erection. The increased blood flow also compresses the veins that drain blood from the penis, maintaining the erection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Alprostadil is contraindicated in men with hypersensitivity to the drug, urethral stricture, certain penile conditions, sickle cell disease or trait, blood clotting disorders, those prone to venous thrombosis,  and in situations where sexual activity is inadvisable. It should not be used with other intracavernosal vasodilators.  Men with penile implants should also avoid using this medication.

* **Warnings:** There's an increased risk of penile fibrosis (scarring), injection site bleeding (especially in patients on anticoagulants), and needle breakage with intracavernosal injections.  Prolonged erections (priapism) are a serious complication and require immediate medical attention.  The use of Alprostadil during pregnancy is contraindicated.
