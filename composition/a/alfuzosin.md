# Alfuzosin

**Generic Name:** Alfuzosin

**Usage:**

Alfuzosin is used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also known as an enlarged prostate.  It relaxes the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making urination easier.  It's specifically used to improve urinary flow and reduce symptoms like frequent urination, especially at night (nocturia), weak urine stream, and the feeling that the bladder isn't completely empty.  It is *not* a treatment for prostate cancer.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Drowsiness
* Nasal congestion
* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up, leading to dizziness or fainting)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast heartbeat
* Chest pain
* Priapism (a prolonged and painful erection)


**How it Works:**

Alfuzosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker.  In the prostate and bladder neck, alpha-1 receptors cause muscle contraction.  By blocking these receptors, alfuzosin relaxes the muscles, allowing for improved urine flow.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking alfuzosin?**  Alcohol can worsen the dizziness and drowsiness caused by alfuzosin. It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **Can alfuzosin cause impotence (erectile dysfunction)?** While rare, it's possible.  If you experience erectile dysfunction, consult your doctor.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Can I stop taking alfuzosin suddenly?** No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to worsening symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping the medication.

* **Can alfuzosin interact with other medications?** Yes. It can interact with several medications, including other blood pressure medications, certain antidepressants, and antifungal medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

* **Who shouldn't take alfuzosin?** People with a history of severe liver disease, severe hypotension, or allergy to alfuzosin should not take this medication.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before using this medication.

* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to see the full benefits of alfuzosin.
