# Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live
### Generic Name
Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live

### Usage
Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live is used for active immunization to prevent febrile acute respiratory disease caused by adenoviruses type 4 and 7.  This vaccine is currently approved only for use in military personnel aged 17-50 years.  It's crucial to understand that this vaccine is *not* intended for the general population or for use outside of this specific demographic.

### Dosage
**Prevention of febrile acute respiratory disease:**  A single dose of the vaccine is administered orally. This consists of two tablets â€“ one containing live adenovirus type 4 and the other containing live adenovirus type 7.  Both tablets must be swallowed whole; do not chew, crush, or break them.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of this vaccine haven't been established in children under 17 years old.  Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this age group.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are necessary based on hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling. However, always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

### Side Effects
The following side effects have been reported:

**Common (occurring in >10% of individuals):** Nasal congestion, diarrhea, headache, nausea, and cough.

**Less Common (occurring in 1-10% of individuals):** Fever (pyrexia), limb pain, and runny nose (rhinorrhea).

**Rare (occurring in <1% of individuals):** Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), hematuria (blood in the urine), gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines), pneumonia, and hematochezia (blood in the stool).

**Serious but less common side effects** may occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after receiving the vaccine, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
This vaccine contains live, but not attenuated (weakened), adenoviruses type 4 and 7. When administered orally, these viruses replicate within the intestinal tract, stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against these specific adenoviruses. This acquired immunity helps protect against future infections caused by these adenovirus types.  The immune response is achieved through the live viruses replicating in the gut, prompting antibody production.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine.
* Inability to swallow the tablets whole.
* Pregnancy (the vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women).  A pregnancy test is required for women of reproductive age before receiving the vaccine.  Effective contraception should be used during and for six weeks after vaccination.

**Warnings:**

* There's a potential for shedding of the virus in the stool for up to 28 days after vaccination.  This can pose a risk to individuals in close contact, such as young children, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals.  Good hygiene practices, including frequent handwashing, are essential.
* The vaccine may interact with immunosuppressants or other medications affecting the immune system.  Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* The safety and effectiveness of the vaccine have not been fully established in immunocompromised individuals.
* Postpone vaccination if the recipient is suffering from a moderate or severe illness.  Mild illness is usually not a contraindication. However, vaccination should be delayed if accompanied by diarrhea or vomiting.
