# Avibactam + Ceftazidime
### Generic Name
Avibactam + Ceftazidime

### Usage

Avibactam and Ceftazidime is a combination antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections in adults.  It's primarily used for complicated intra-abdominal infections (infections within the abdomen) and complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs).  These infections are often caused by bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. The combination targets bacteria that produce beta-lactamases, enzymes that can break down many common antibiotics like Ceftazidime, rendering them ineffective.  Avibactam's role is to inhibit these beta-lactamases, allowing Ceftazidime to work effectively.  It's crucial to understand that this combination is reserved for severe infections and is typically used only when other antibiotics haven't been successful.


### Dosage

**Adults:** Dosage varies depending on the infection and the patient's kidney function (creatinine clearance, ClCr).  The typical dosage for complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections is 2.5 grams (0.5g avibactam + 2g ceftazidime) every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for a duration ranging from 5-14 days (intra-abdominal infections often requiring the addition of metronidazole).  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function:

* **ClCr > 50 mL/min:** No dose adjustment is needed.
* **ClCr 50-31 mL/min:** 1.25 g (0.25 g avibactam + 1 g ceftazidime) every 8 hours.
* **ClCr 30-16 mL/min:** 0.94 g (0.19 g avibactam + 0.75 g ceftazidime) every 12 hours.
* **ClCr 15-6 mL/min:** 0.94 g (0.19 g avibactam + 0.75 g ceftazidime) every 24 hours.
* **ClCr < 5 mL/min:** 0.94 g (0.19 g avibactam + 0.75 g ceftazidime) every 48 hours.


**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Avibactam + Ceftazidime in children haven't been established.


**Administration:**  The medication is administered intravenously (IV) and should be infused over a period of 2 hours.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Anxiety
* Constipation

Less common but potentially serious side effects (occurring in less than 1% of patients) may include:

* Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Low potassium levels (hypokalemia)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils in the blood)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Prolonged prothrombin time (increased bleeding risk)
* Acute kidney failure
* Kidney dysfunction
* Candidiasis (yeast infection)
* Hives (urticaria)
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash
* Injection site phlebitis (inflammation of a vein at the injection site)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Avibactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Beta-lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that break down beta-lactam antibiotics (like ceftazidime), making them ineffective.  Avibactam binds to and inhibits these enzymes, preventing them from destroying ceftazidime.  Ceftazidime, a cephalosporin antibiotic, works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis, ceftazidime weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to bacterial death.  The combination of avibactam and ceftazidime provides a synergistic effect, enhancing the antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  This combination is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to avibactam, ceftazidime, or any components of the formulation. Cross-sensitivity with other beta-lactam antibiotics is possible.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are required for patients with impaired kidney function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Avibactam + Ceftazidime is categorized as pregnancy category B.  While generally considered safe during pregnancy,  it's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare professional.  Avibactam is excreted in breast milk, and caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with probenecid, warfarin, certain vaccines (cholera, typhoid), chloramphenicol, and some oral contraceptives may affect the efficacy or safety of Avibactam + Ceftazidime.  Discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients should be well-hydrated during treatment.  Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis), kidney and liver function changes, and bleeding.  Abrupt withdrawal should be avoided.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Avibactam + Ceftazidime with food?** A:  It can be taken without regard to food.

* **Q: How should I store Avibactam + Ceftazidime?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist; do not double the dose.
