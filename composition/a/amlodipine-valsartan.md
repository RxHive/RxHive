# Amlodipine + Valsartan
### Generic Name
Amlodipine/Valsartan

### Usage

Amlodipine/Valsartan is a combination medication used primarily to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by targeting two different systems in the body that contribute to high blood pressure.  Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that relaxes blood vessels, making it easier for blood to flow. Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that prevents the constriction of blood vessels, further lowering blood pressure.  This combined action makes it particularly effective in controlling blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke.  While primarily used for hypertension, it may sometimes be considered for patients with established cardiovascular disease to help manage the condition and prevent complications.

### Dosage

Dosage of Amlodipine/Valsartan is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on factors like blood pressure, overall health, and response to the medication.  There is no single "one-size-fits-all" dosage.   Commonly, the medication is available in tablet form for oral administration.


* **Adults:** The starting dose is typically lower and then adjusted based on response. The doctor will slowly increase the dose as needed and tolerated. The maximum dose is determined based on individual patient needs and tolerance.  Specific dosages vary greatly depending on the formulation and combination of amlodipine and valsartan within the tablet.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and do not adjust it without consulting them.

* **Children:**  Amlodipine/Valsartan is generally **not** recommended for use in children.  Separate amlodipine and valsartan formulations may be used in children under specific circumstances and with careful monitoring by a physician, but this is not common with the combination drug.

* **IV Administration:** Amlodipine/Valsartan is not available as an intravenous (IV) formulation. Both Amlodipine and Valsartan are available as IV medication, separately, but these are administered under strict medical supervision in specific circumstances.

**Important Note:**  Never start or stop taking Amlodipine/Valsartan or change the dose without consulting your doctor.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Swelling in the ankles or feet
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Flushing (redness of the face)
* Constipation
* Runny nose

Less common, but serious side effects that require immediate medical attention:

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema) â€“ this is a medical emergency.
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Chest pain
* Shortness of breath
* Severe dizziness or fainting


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Amlodipine/Valsartan combines the actions of two distinct classes of antihypertensive drugs.  Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, relaxes and widens blood vessels (vasodilation). This reduces the resistance to blood flow, lowering blood pressure. Valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking this hormone, valsartan prevents blood vessel constriction, further contributing to lower blood pressure.  The combined effect of these two mechanisms leads to more effective blood pressure control compared to either drug used alone.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Amlodipine/Valsartan should not be taken by individuals with known allergies to amlodipine, valsartan, or any other components of the medication.  It's also generally avoided in individuals with severe liver disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, including certain diuretics, potassium supplements, and other blood pressure medications.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy due to the potential risk to the developing fetus. Consult your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking this medication.  Its use during breastfeeding should also be carefully considered and discussed with your healthcare provider.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication.  Careful monitoring and dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** This medication should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney impairment, as dosage adjustments might be needed.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Amlodipine/Valsartan?** A:  While small amounts of alcohol may not pose significant risks, excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure excessively and can interact negatively with this medication.  It's best to limit alcohol intake or avoid it entirely while on this medication.  Always consult your doctor regarding alcohol consumption.

* **Q: How should I store Amlodipine/Valsartan?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the label.  Keep it out of the reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Amlodipine/Valsartan suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping this medication can be harmful and lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing your medication regimen.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q:  Is Amlodipine/Valsartan a cure for high blood pressure?**  A: No, it's a medication to help manage and control high blood pressure. Lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and stress management are also crucial in managing hypertension.
