# Azithromycin + Lactic acid bacillus
### Generic Name
Azithromycin + Lactic acid bacillus (combination)


**Note:**  This information is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of any medical condition.  The specific formulation of Azithromycin + Lactic acid bacillus will vary depending on the manufacturer and may include additional excipients.  The information below is a general overview and may not apply to all formulations.


### Usage

This combination medication typically treats bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, often those complicated by dysbiosis (an imbalance of gut bacteria).  Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, directly targets and kills susceptible bacteria.  Lactic acid bacillus, a probiotic, helps restore the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut, mitigating the potential for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and promoting gut health.  The combination is often used in cases where both antibacterial action and gut flora restoration are considered beneficial.  The specific bacterial infections treated will depend on the physician's assessment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific formulation, the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  There isn't a standardized universal dosage for this combination therapy since it's not a pre-packaged, universally available, single product.  The Azithromycin component will usually be administered according to standard Azithromycin dosing guidelines, which typically involve a short course of therapy (e.g., 3-5 days).  The Lactic acid bacillus component's dosage will depend on the specific probiotic strain and the manufacturer's recommendations, usually taken daily as directed.

**Crucially:** This combination is not typically a pre-packaged medication.  A healthcare professional will prescribe Azithromycin and a separate probiotic supplement (containing lactic acid bacillus) individually, tailoring the dosage to the patient's needs.  *Do not attempt to combine these medications without direct instruction from a physician.*  There is a potential for interactions depending on the specific formulations of each.

**Oral Administration:** Both components are usually administered orally. Azithromycin is available as tablets, capsules, and suspensions.  The probiotic will often be in capsule or powder form.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by the prescribing physician and pharmacist.

**IV Administration:** Azithromycin is available for intravenous administration in certain cases of severe infection.  However, lactic acid bacillus is not administered intravenously.


### Side Effects

**Azithromycin:**

*   Common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
*   Less Common but Serious:  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), liver inflammation (hepatitis), prolonged QT interval (heart rhythm abnormality)
*   Rare:  Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)


**Lactic Acid Bacillus (Probiotic):**

*   Generally well-tolerated.  However, some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort (gas, bloating) initially.  These side effects usually resolve as the body adjusts.


**Combined Medication Considerations:**  The combined side effects will depend on the individual response to each component.


### How it Works

Azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial growth and causing bacterial cell death.  This action effectively targets and eliminates the infecting bacteria.  Lactic acid bacillus works by colonizing the gut and competing with harmful bacteria for resources and space.  By increasing the population of beneficial bacteria, it helps restore the gut's microbial balance, reduces the prevalence of harmful bacteria, and minimizes the potential for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and other gut-related issues.


### Precautions

*   **Allergies:**  Individuals with known allergies to azithromycin or any macrolide antibiotics should avoid this medication.  Allergic reactions to probiotics are rare but possible.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Azithromycin can interact with other medications, including certain antifungals, anticoagulants, and drugs metabolized by the liver.  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking. Probiotics may interact with some medications, though this is less common.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult your healthcare provider.
*   **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Azithromycin should be used cautiously in individuals with liver or kidney disease. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
*   **Other Conditions:**  Pre-existing medical conditions should be discussed with a healthcare professional before initiating this medication.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to work?**  A: The effects of azithromycin are usually seen within a few days, while the benefits of the probiotic may take a little longer to become fully apparent.
*   **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: Alcohol can interact negatively with some antibiotics. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking azithromycin.  Consult your doctor.
*   **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store Azithromycin as directed on the label.  Probiotics should usually be stored in a cool, dry place.
*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Follow the instructions on the prescription or consult your pharmacist or doctor.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**  A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
