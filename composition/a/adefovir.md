# Adefovir

**Generic Name:** Adefovir Dipivoxil

**Usage:**

Adefovir dipivoxil is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection in adults.  It's not a cure, but it can help to suppress the virus, reducing the amount of virus in the blood (viral load) and improving liver function.  It may be used alone or in combination with other antiviral medications.  In some cases, it might be used to treat HBV infection in children, although this is less common and typically only considered in specific circumstances under close medical supervision.  It's important to note that adefovir is **not** effective against hepatitis C or other viral infections.

**Side Effects:**

Adefovir dipivoxil can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent.  The most common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A frequent complaint.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Abdominal pain:** Pain in the stomach area.
* **Back pain:**  Aching or pain in the back.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Kidney problems:**  Adefovir can affect kidney function, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.  Regular blood tests to monitor kidney function are crucial.
* **Decreased bone mineral density:** Leading to an increased risk of fractures.  This is a more long-term concern.
* **Fanconi syndrome:** A rare but serious kidney disorder affecting the way the kidneys reabsorb nutrients.
* **Rhabdomyolysis:**  A breakdown of muscle tissue, potentially life-threatening.


**How it Works:**

Adefovir dipivoxil is a nucleotide analog.  Once it enters the body, it's converted to adefovir, which interferes with the hepatitis B virus's ability to replicate.  Specifically, it inhibits the activity of the viral DNA polymerase, an enzyme essential for the virus to make copies of itself. By blocking this enzyme, adefovir reduces the amount of virus in the body and helps to slow the progression of liver disease.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long do I need to take adefovir?**  A: The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor and depends on factors like your viral load, liver health, and response to treatment. Treatment is often long-term, sometimes for life.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking adefovir?** A:  It's generally recommended to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking adefovir, as alcohol can further stress the liver.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: Can I take adefovir with other medications?** A:  You should inform your doctor of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) you are taking to avoid potential drug interactions.  Some interactions may necessitate dose adjustments or the avoidance of certain medications.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain, muscle weakness or pain, changes in urination, or unusual fatigue.
