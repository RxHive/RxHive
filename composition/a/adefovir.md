# Adefovir
### Generic Name
Adefovir

### Usage
Adefovir is primarily used to treat chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  It's a type of antiviral medication called a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (ntRTI).  Adefovir works by interfering with the hepatitis B virus's ability to replicate, thereby reducing the viral load in the body and improving liver function.  While its primary use is in chronic HBV, it is not used to treat acute hepatitis B infections or other viral infections.

### Dosage

**Adults (Chronic Hepatitis B):** The usual adult dose is 10 mg taken orally once daily.  The duration of treatment varies considerably depending on factors such as the presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), the level of HBV DNA, and the presence of liver cirrhosis.  Treatment may continue for months to years, even after viral suppression is achieved.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate duration of treatment based on individual patient needs and response to therapy.

**Children (Chronic Hepatitis B):**  The dosage for children aged 12 years and older is the same as for adults (10 mg orally once daily).  However, the safety and efficacy of adefovir have not been established in children younger than 12 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (renal impairment).  The dosage and frequency of administration will be reduced based on the level of kidney function, as determined by creatinine clearance (CrCl).  Patients on hemodialysis will receive a modified dosage schedule.  For individuals with liver impairment (hepatic impairment), dosage adjustment is generally not required, but close monitoring is recommended.  Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dose for individuals with renal or hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Weakness
* Back pain
* Cough
* Rhinitis
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Increased serum creatinine levels (indicating kidney problems)
* Renal failure
* Fanconi syndrome (a rare kidney disorder)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Myopathy (muscle disease)
* Osteomalacia (softening of the bones)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Proximal tubular nephropathy (kidney damage)
* Hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate levels)


It's crucial to report any side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.  The severity of side effects can vary from person to person.


### How it Works

Adefovir is a nucleotide analog that inhibits hepatitis B viral DNA polymerase, a crucial enzyme for viral replication.  By blocking this enzyme, adefovir prevents the hepatitis B virus from making copies of itself, thereby reducing the viral load and allowing the body's immune system to better control the infection. This, in turn, leads to improvements in liver function and reduces the risk of liver damage.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Adefovir is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to adefovir or any of its components.

**Drug Interactions:** Adefovir may interact with other medications, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, ribavirin, and tenofovir.  These interactions can either increase the risk of side effects or reduce the effectiveness of the medication.  It's essential to inform a healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken before starting adefovir.

**Warnings:**  Adefovir can cause nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), particularly in individuals with pre-existing kidney problems.  Close monitoring of renal function is crucial, especially during long-term therapy.  Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported upon discontinuation of adefovir.  Therefore, careful monitoring of liver function is essential following treatment cessation.  Adefovir should be used cautiously in patients with underlying liver disease and in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  The potential risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take adefovir with food?**  A: Adefovir can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store adefovir?** A: Store adefovir at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I stop taking adefovir when I feel better?** A: No, do not discontinue adefovir without consulting your doctor.  Stopping treatment prematurely can lead to a resurgence of the virus and potential liver damage.  Your doctor will determine when it's safe to discontinue therapy based on your individual circumstances.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects associated with adefovir?** A: Long-term use of adefovir may be associated with kidney problems and bone-related issues in some individuals. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is important to detect and manage potential long-term effects.
