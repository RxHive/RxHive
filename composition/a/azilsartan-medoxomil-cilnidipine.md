# Azilsartan medoxomil + Cilnidipine
### Generic Name
Azilsartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine

### Usage
Azilsartan medoxomil/cilnidipine is a combination medication used primarily to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by targeting two different systems involved in blood pressure regulation. Azilsartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), which blocks the effects of a hormone that narrows blood vessels. Cilnidipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, which relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow. By combining these two mechanisms, the medication offers a more comprehensive approach to lowering blood pressure than either drug alone.  This combination is particularly useful for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication.


### Dosage

Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and personalized to the individual's needs and response to treatment.  There isn't a universally standardized dosage across all formulations, and strength may vary depending on the manufacturer.  Always refer to the specific prescribing information provided with your medication.

**General guidance (this is not a substitute for professional advice):**  Dosage is typically once daily, usually taken in the morning. It's crucial to take this medication as prescribed, even if you feel well.  Skipping doses can lead to inconsistent blood pressure control.

* **Oral:** The typical starting dose will be a single tablet of a specific strength combination, as prescribed.  Your doctor may adjust the dose based on your blood pressure readings.  
* **IV:** This combination is not available in an intravenous (IV) formulation.  Intravenous medications for hypertension are usually different drugs administered under close medical supervision.

**Children:** This medication is not typically used in children.  Treatment for hypertension in children requires specialized pediatric care and different medications.

**Elderly:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients due to potential changes in kidney function.  A doctor will monitor closely and adjust accordingly.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Swelling in the ankles or feet
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)

Less common but serious side effects that require immediate medical attention:

* Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema) â€“ This is a rare but serious allergic reaction.
* Chest pain
* Irregular heartbeat
* Severe dizziness or fainting
* Signs of kidney problems (such as decreased urination or changes in urine color)

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Azilsartan medoxomil blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict.  By blocking this hormone, azilsartan helps relax and widen the blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure. Cilnidipine works by blocking the entry of calcium into the muscle cells of blood vessels.  Less calcium means these muscles relax, causing the blood vessels to dilate (widen) further, reducing resistance to blood flow and lowering blood pressure. The combined effect of these two mechanisms results in a more substantial and sustained reduction in blood pressure compared to using either drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is not suitable for people with a history of angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) related to ACE inhibitors or ARBs.  It should also be avoided by those with severe liver or kidney disease.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and other prescription medications.  Some medications can interact with azilsartan medoxomil/cilnidipine and affect their effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects.  Grapefruit juice can interact with some calcium channel blockers and should be avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication should not be taken during pregnancy unless specifically advised by a doctor.  The safety of this medication during breastfeeding is not fully established.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider.
* **Elderly Patients:**  As mentioned previously, dose adjustments may be necessary for older adults due to potential changes in kidney function.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Dizziness is a potential side effect.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience dizziness until you know how this medication affects you.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  A: No, you should never stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can cause a sudden spike in blood pressure, which can be dangerous.  Your doctor will gradually reduce your dose if needed.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as instructed on the label. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for people with kidney problems?** A: This medication may require dose adjustment or may not be appropriate for people with severe kidney problems. Your doctor will assess your kidney function and determine the suitability of this medication.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol intake can lower blood pressure excessively and should be avoided, especially while taking antihypertensive medication.  Consult your doctor for guidance.
