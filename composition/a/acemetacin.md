# Acemetacin
### Generic Name
Acemetacin

### Usage
Acemetacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to manage pain and inflammation.  Its primary use is in treating various forms of arthritis, including acute gout flares, chronic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis. It's also effective for managing pain and inflammation from soft tissue rheumatic disorders, injuries, lower back pain, and post-surgical pain.  Acemetacin provides relief from both the pain and the underlying inflammation causing it.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the severity, and the patient's individual health.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  

**Adults:**

* **Acute Gout Flares:**  For immediate-release formulations, the initial dose is typically 120 mg, followed by 60 mg every 6 hours (maximum 300 mg/day) for up to two days in patients without pre-existing gastrointestinal issues. The dose is then usually reduced. Extended-release formulations may be used at a different dosage regimen (180 mg/day in divided doses).
* **Other Pain and Inflammation:** Immediate-release formulations are typically dosed at 60-180 mg/day in 1-3 divided doses. Extended-release formulations are usually prescribed at 90-180 mg/day in 1-2 divided doses.  Extended-release formulations are generally not recommended for initial treatment of acute pain.

**Children and Adolescents:**  The safety and efficacy of Acemetacin in children and adolescents have not been established; therefore, its use is contraindicated in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  For mild to moderate impairment, adjustments may not be necessary, but caution is advised. Severe impairment typically contraindicates the use of Acemetacin.  Always consult your doctor before adjusting the dosage.

**Administration:** Acemetacin is typically administered orally. Immediate-release forms can be taken with or after food. Extended-release capsules should be swallowed whole.

### How it Works
Acemetacin is a unique NSAID; its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood. It's a glycolic acid ester of indomethacin and works by reducing inflammation and pain, though it's a weaker inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase than many other NSAIDs. While the precise way it achieves this is still under investigation, the result is pain and inflammation reduction.

### Precautions
Acemetacin is contraindicated in several situations:  known allergy to Acemetacin or indomethacin, history of asthma, bronchospasm, or allergic reactions to NSAIDs or aspirin;  history of peptic ulcers or GI bleeding;  certain blood disorders; nasal polyps with angioneurotic edema; third trimester of pregnancy; children and adolescents; and severe heart, liver, or kidney failure.  

Use with caution in patients with:  edema or hypertension, history of GI ulcers, coagulopathy, smoking or alcohol use, older age or debility, other forms of asthma (excluding aspirin-sensitive asthma), mild-to-moderate liver or kidney impairment, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, Parkinson's disease, inducible porphyria, psychiatric disorders, varicella zoster infection, during surgery, epilepsy, or those performing tasks requiring alertness.  Acemetacin may also impair female fertility.

Acemetacin can interact with other medications, including zidovudine, fosphenytoin/phenytoin, other NSAIDs, and penicillins.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
