# Atracurium
### Generic Name
Atracurium

### Usage
Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.  Its primary use is as an adjunct to general anesthesia, facilitating endotracheal intubation (insertion of a breathing tube) and providing skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery.  It's also used to help with mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who are adequately sedated.  Off-label uses include managing shivering during therapeutic hypothermia.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage must be individualized due to patient variability. Adequate pain control and sedation are crucial before and during atracurium administration.

* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Paralysis:**  For mechanical ventilation in patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (PaO2/FiO2 < 150) and to relieve shivering from therapeutic hypothermia (off-label):  Initial IV bolus of 0.4-0.5 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 4-20 mcg/kg/min (0.24-1.2 mg/kg/h). For shivering, use may be up to 48 hours.

* **Neuromuscular Blockade (Surgery/Intubation):** For endotracheal intubation, surgery, or mechanical ventilation (as an adjunct to general anesthesia):

    * **IV Bolus:** 0.4-0.5 mg/kg initially, followed by 0.08-0.1 mg/kg 20-45 minutes later to maintain the block. Repeat doses at 15-25-minute intervals as needed.  The initial dose might be reduced to 0.3-0.4 mg/kg in patients with significant cardiovascular disease or a history of increased histamine release risk (e.g., severe anaphylactoid reactions or asthma). After succinylcholine for intubation (balanced anesthesia): 0.3-0.4 mg/kg.  Pretreatment/priming with 10% of the intubation dose (0.04-0.05 mg/kg) 2-4 minutes before the larger second dose can be considered.
    * **Continuous Infusion:** For extended procedures, initiate a continuous infusion at initial signs of recovery from the bolus dose, starting at 9-10 mcg/kg/min (0.54-0.6 mg/kg/h). Maintenance is usually 5-9 mcg/kg/min (0.3-0.54 mg/kg/h) under balanced anesthesia; the range is 2-15 mcg/kg/min (0.12-0.9 mg/kg/h).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly by age.  Always consult the prescribing information for precise pediatric guidelines. Generally, lower doses are used for infants and children, with careful titration based on clinical response.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is usually necessary for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

* **Common (1-10%):** Flushing.
* **Less Common (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):** Bradycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, erythema, hypersensitivity reactions, hypotension, increased bronchial secretions, injection site reactions, laryngospasm, pruritus, seizures, tachycardia, urticaria, and wheezing.

Any adverse effect necessitates contacting a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Atracurium works by blocking neuromuscular transmission at the neuromuscular junction. It competitively binds to the cholinergic receptor sites, preventing acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) from binding and initiating muscle contraction. This results in muscle relaxation.  Atracurium is metabolized in the body, primarily by non-enzymatic Hofmann elimination, which means it doesn't require liver or kidney metabolism for elimination.  This is a significant advantage in patients with liver or kidney disease.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to atracurium or any formulation component, known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol (present in multi-dose vials).
* **Increased Risk:** Anaphylaxis, bradycardia.
* **Use with Caution:** In elderly patients and patients with a history of anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Drug Interactions:** Atracurium's effects can be increased or decreased by several other medications (see detailed interaction list in the original data).  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Atracurium is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning the risk to the fetus is unknown.  Excretion in breast milk is also unknown, warranting caution in breastfeeding mothers.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does atracurium's effect last?** A: The duration depends on the dose and method of administration (bolus vs. infusion).  It typically lasts for several minutes to an hour, but it can be extended with continuous infusion.

* **Q: Can I drive after receiving atracurium?** A:  No. Atracurium causes significant muscle weakness and impairs respiratory function. Driving is strictly prohibited until the effects have completely worn off and you receive clearance from your doctor.

* **Q: How is atracurium stored?** A: Store atracurium according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at room temperature away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Atracurium is usually administered by healthcare professionals in controlled settings. If you have questions about your treatment plan, consult your doctor or nurse.

* **Q:  Is atracurium safe for long-term use?** A:  Atracurium is not intended for long-term use. Prolonged use carries the risk of serious side effects, including prolonged paralysis and myopathy (muscle disease).
