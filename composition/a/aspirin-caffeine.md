# Aspirin + Caffeine

**Generic Name:** Acetylsalicylic acid + Caffeine

**Usage:**  Aspirin + Caffeine combination is used to relieve mild to moderate pain, such as headache, muscle aches, and menstrual cramps.  Caffeine enhances the pain-relieving effects of aspirin. It's also sometimes used to reduce fever.  It's important to note that this combination is an over-the-counter (OTC) medication and should be used as directed on the product label.  Consult a doctor if symptoms persist or worsen.  This combination is not recommended for long-term use without medical supervision.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects can include stomach upset, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.  More serious, though less common, side effects can include allergic reactions (such as hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), stomach bleeding, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and increased blood pressure.  Stop use and seek medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


**How it Works:** Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body.  It also reduces fever by affecting the area of the brain that regulates temperature. Caffeine acts as a mild stimulant, increasing alertness and potentially enhancing the pain-relieving effects of aspirin by constricting blood vessels.
