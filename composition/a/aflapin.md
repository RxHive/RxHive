# Aflapin

There is no drug officially known as "Aflapin."  It's possible this is a misspelling, a brand name specific to a certain region, or a completely fabricated name.  To provide accurate information, I need the correct name of the medication or its active ingredient.

If you can provide the correct name or more information (e.g., what condition it treats), I can offer details about its generic name, usage, side effects, mechanism of action, and FAQs.
