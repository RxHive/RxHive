# Afloqualone
### Generic Name
Afloqualone

### Usage
Afloqualone is a skeletal muscle relaxant primarily used to relieve muscle tension associated with neck-shoulder-arm syndrome (a condition causing pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and arms) and back pain.  It's also indicated for the treatment of spastic paralysis, a condition where muscles become stiff or contracted involuntarily.  The drug's effectiveness in relieving muscle spasms makes it useful in managing pain and improving function in these conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For muscle relaxation and spastic paralysis, the typical oral dosage is 20 mg three times a day (TID). Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage regimen.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of afloqualone in children have not been established. It should not be used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult your doctor before taking afloqualone if you have liver or kidney disease.

Common side effects may include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Feeling of heaviness
* Headache (rare)
* Head titubation (involuntary head shaking)

### How it Works

Afloqualone's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of both polysynaptic reflexes (PSR) and monosynaptic reflexes (MSR) in the spinal cord.  It's noteworthy that afloqualone demonstrates a higher selectivity for PSR inhibition compared to MSR inhibition.  This selective action, along with its reported high selectivity for gamma motor neurons, contributes to its muscle relaxant effects.  Essentially, it interferes with the nerve signals that cause muscle spasms and contractions.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Afloqualone should be avoided by women who are pregnant or may become pregnant.  The excretion of afloqualone in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding is not recommended during afloqualone use.

* **Interactions:** Afloqualone can interact with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, potentially increasing their sedative effects.  Concurrent use with azelastine (nasal), bromperidol, oxomemazine, and suvorexant should be avoided or carefully managed under a doctor's supervision.  If you are taking other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, inform your doctor before starting afloqualone.

* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are mentioned in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, individuals with hypersensitivity to afloqualone or its components should avoid use.

* **Increased Risk:**  Use caution in elderly patients due to increased sensitivity to CNS depressants. Be aware of the increased risk for hypersensitivity reactions (rash, urticaria), CNS depression, and photosensitivity.


* **Other precautions:**  Monitor for central nervous system effects like changes in mental status and excessive drowsiness.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for afloqualone to work?** A: The onset of action and duration of effect can vary depending on the individual.  Consult your doctor for specific timing information.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking afloqualone?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol consumption while taking afloqualone, as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and other CNS-depressant effects.

* **Q: How should I store afloqualone?** A: Store afloqualone as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
