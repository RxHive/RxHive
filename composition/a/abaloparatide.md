# Abaloparatide
### Generic Name
Abaloparatide

### Usage
Abaloparatide is a medication used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who are at high risk for fractures.  This high-risk group includes women with a history of osteoporotic fractures, those with multiple risk factors for fractures, or those who haven't responded well to, or can't tolerate, other osteoporosis treatments.  Its primary use is to reduce the risk of vertebral (spine) and non-vertebral fractures.


### Dosage
The typical adult dosage of abaloparatide is 80 mcg given once daily as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  The injection site should be rotated daily and administered at approximately the same time each day.  The cumulative lifetime duration of abaloparatide (or its similar drug, teriparatide) therapy should not exceed two years.  

Patients should ensure adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D through diet or supplementation. However, caution is necessary to avoid hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels).  A serum calcium level should be checked before starting treatment, and abaloparatide should not be used in patients with pre-existing hypercalcemia or a hypercalcemic disorder.  

**Pediatric use:** The safety and effectiveness of abaloparatide in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Increased uric acid levels
* Antibody development
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Hypercalciuria (increased calcium in urine)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Palpitations
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Nausea
* Upper abdominal pain
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels)
* Swelling at the injection site
* Pain at the injection site

Many other side effects have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including insomnia, lethargy, malaise, pain, dyspnea (shortness of breath), various gastrointestinal issues, skin rashes, pruritus (itching), hypersensitivity reactions, and musculoskeletal pain.  

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Abaloparatide is an analog of a human parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP[1-34]).  It works by acting as an agonist at the PTH1 receptor, stimulating osteoblast function (bone-building cells). This increased activity of osteoblasts leads to an increase in bone mass and strength, ultimately reducing fracture risk.


### Precautions
* **Contraindicated:** Abaloparatide is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, dyspnea, urticaria) to abaloparatide or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of hypercalcemia, orthostatic hypotension, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), hypercalciuria, and urolithiasis (kidney stones).
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with active or recent urolithiasis.
* **Boxed Warning (Osteosarcoma):**  Studies in animals showed a dose-dependent increase in osteosarcoma. While the relevance to humans is unclear, the drug is not recommended for patients at increased risk of osteosarcoma (e.g., Paget's disease, unexplained high alkaline phosphatase, open epiphyses, bone metastases, skeletal malignancies, hereditary predispositions, or prior skeletal radiation therapy).  Cumulative use of abaloparatide and similar drugs should not exceed two years.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long should I take abaloparatide?** A: The typical treatment duration is up to two years.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate length of treatment.
