# Aminolevulinic Acid (Topical)
### Generic Name
Aminolevulinic Acid (Topical)

### Usage

Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) topical is a photosensitizing agent used in conjunction with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to treat actinic keratosis (AK), a precancerous skin condition characterized by rough, scaly patches.  The specific type of light used in PDT depends on the formulation of ALA:

* **ALA gel (10%):** Used with narrowband red light for mild-to-moderate AK of the face and scalp.
* **ALA solution (20%):** Used with blue light for minimally to moderately thick AK of the face, scalp, or upper extremities.
* **ALA patch (8 mg):** Used with narrowband red LED light for mild-to-moderate AK of the face and scalp (hairless areas).

While not formally approved for this use, ALA solution is sometimes used off-label to treat actinic cheilitis, a similar condition affecting the lips.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the formulation and the area being treated.  Always follow your doctor's instructions and the specific product labeling.  Examples are provided below but should not be considered a substitute for professional guidance.

**Actinic Keratosis:**

* **Gel (10%):**  Apply a thin layer (~1 mm thick) to the affected area, extending about 5 mm beyond the lesion's edge. The total area treated should not exceed 20 cmÂ², and no more than 2g should be used at once. Cover with a light-blocking dressing for 3 hours, then remove the dressing, wipe off excess gel, and proceed with red light illumination.
* **Solution (20%):** Apply to the lesion only, avoiding surrounding healthy skin.  Blue light illumination follows after 3 hours (upper extremities) or 14-18 hours (face and scalp).
* **Patch (8 mg):** Apply one patch per lesion (maximum of 8 patches per treatment session). Leave in place for 4 hours before removal and subsequent narrowband red LED light illumination.

**Actinic Cheilitis (Off-Label Use):**

* **Solution (20%):** Apply to the lip lesion(s), followed by photodynamic therapy 2-3 hours later.  Repeat treatments as needed, up to three sessions, at four-week intervals.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of ALA topical in children under 18 have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Burning sensation
* Skin scaling, crusting, or exfoliation
* Erythema (redness)
* Itching
* Local pain or discomfort

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:

* Skin blistering or ulceration
* Eyelid edema
* Hemorrhage (bleeding) at the treatment site
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  Contact your healthcare provider for any concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

ALA is a precursor to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photosensitizer.  When applied topically and subsequently exposed to specific wavelengths of light (red or blue, depending on the formulation), ALA is converted to PpIX within the skin cells.  PpIX absorbs the light energy, producing a reaction that destroys abnormal precancerous cells.  Precancerous and cancerous cells accumulate more PpIX than normal cells, making this a targeted therapy.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** ALA topical is contraindicated in patients with known allergies to ALA, porphyrins, or any formulation components.
* **Porphyria:** Individuals with porphyria (a group of inherited disorders affecting porphyrin metabolism) should not use ALA.
* **Photodermatoses:** Patients with photodermatoses (skin conditions aggravated by sunlight) should avoid ALA.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While topical application is not expected to result in significant systemic exposure, consult your doctor before using ALA if pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  ALA may interact with other photosensitizing agents, potentially increasing the risk of photosensitivity. Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting ALA treatment.
* **Eye Protection:**  Always wear appropriate eye protection during PDT treatment, both the patient and the healthcare provider.
* **Sunlight Avoidance:**  Strictly avoid sun exposure for a specified period (usually 40-48 hours) after ALA application, as the treated skin becomes highly photosensitive.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does ALA treatment take?** A: The total treatment time varies depending on the formulation and the type of photodynamic therapy used. It usually involves applying the ALA and then undergoing a light treatment session several hours later.

* **Q: How many treatments are needed?** A: The number of treatments required depends on the severity of the condition and the individual response. Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment plan.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a treatment?** A: Contact your healthcare provider to reschedule your appointment.

* **Q: How should I store ALA topical?** A: Store according to the product label instructions.  Generally, this involves storing at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.  Minor side effects are common, but severe side effects should be addressed promptly.
