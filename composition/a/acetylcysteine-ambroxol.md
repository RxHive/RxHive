# Acetylcysteine + Ambroxol

**Generic Name:** Acetylcysteine + Ambroxol

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat productive coughs (coughs that produce mucus) associated with respiratory tract infections like bronchitis and pneumonia.  Acetylcysteine helps to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. Ambroxol assists in the expectoration of mucus and may also have a mild bronchodilating effect (widening airways).  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the symptoms, not the underlying infection itself.  Always consult a doctor for diagnosis and treatment of infections.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain
* **Respiratory:**  Rarely, bronchospasm (constriction of airways) may occur, particularly in individuals with asthma or a history of bronchospasm.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis, a rare but serious reaction).
* **Other:**  Headache, dizziness, unpleasant taste in the mouth.


**How it Works:**

* **Acetylcysteine (Mucolytic):**  This is a mucolytic agent. It breaks down the disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous (thicker) and easier to expel. This helps clear the airways and improves breathing.
* **Ambroxol (Expectorant):**  This is an expectorant that increases the production of fluid in the respiratory tract, which helps to further thin the mucus and facilitates its removal through coughing. It may also have a mild bronchodilating effect, although this is not its primary mechanism of action.
