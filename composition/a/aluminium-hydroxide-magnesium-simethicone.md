# Aluminium Hydroxide + Magnesium + Simethicone

**Generic Name:** Aluminium Hydroxide, Magnesium Hydroxide, and Simethicone

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat heartburn, upset stomach, and acid indigestion.  It's an antacid that neutralizes stomach acid and a simethicone that helps relieve gas.  It's often used for symptomatic relief, not a cure for underlying conditions.  Always follow prescribed dosage and consult a doctor for persistent or severe symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  While generally considered safe, side effects can occur, though they are usually mild.  These may include:

* **Constipation:**  This is a common side effect, particularly with aluminum-containing antacids.
* **Diarrhea:** This is more likely with magnesium-containing antacids.
* **Changes in bowel movements:**  The consistency of your stools might alter.
* **Abdominal cramping:**  Mild discomfort in the stomach area.
* **Nausea or vomiting:**  Less common but possible.
* **Phosphate depletion (with long-term use):**  Aluminum-containing antacids can interfere with phosphate absorption.  This is more of a concern with prolonged or high-dose usage.
* **Magnesium toxicity (with long-term use and kidney impairment):**  High doses of magnesium can be harmful, especially to people with kidney problems.

**How it Works:**

* **Aluminum Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide:** These are antacids that work by neutralizing the hydrochloric acid in your stomach.  Aluminum hydroxide works more slowly but provides longer-lasting relief, while magnesium hydroxide works more quickly.  The combination aims to balance the speed and duration of acid neutralization, minimizing side effects.
* **Simethicone:** This is an anti-foaming agent that helps break up gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, relieving bloating and gas pressure.
