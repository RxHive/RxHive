# Ambroxol + Levosalbutamol + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Levosalbutamol + Guaifenesin

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat symptoms of respiratory tract infections, particularly those involving bronchitis and other conditions causing cough with phlegm.  It's used to relieve chest congestion and ease breathing.  Ambroxol acts as a mucolytic (thinning mucus), Levosalbutamol is a bronchodilator (opens airways), and Guaifenesin is an expectorant (helps to cough up phlegm).  It's important to note that this combination is not a treatment for the underlying infection itself; it manages the symptoms.  Always follow a doctor's prescription and dosage instructions.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific dosages of each component. Common side effects may include:

* **From Ambroxol:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, headache, dizziness.  Rarely, allergic reactions such as skin rashes or itching.
* **From Levosalbutamol:** Tremors, nervousness, headache, palpitations, increased heart rate, muscle cramps. In rare cases, more serious cardiovascular effects.
* **From Guaifenesin:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, stomach upset.


Serious side effects are less common but should be reported immediately to a doctor. These may include allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), severe dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or unusual changes in breathing.


**How it Works:**

* **Ambroxol:** Increases the production of surfactant in the lungs, helping to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Levosalbutamol:** Relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways, widening the passageways and making breathing easier. It's a beta-2 agonist, meaning it stimulates beta-2 receptors in the lungs.
* **Guaifenesin:** Increases the fluid content of the respiratory tract, thereby reducing the viscosity of mucus and facilitating its expectoration (coughing out).


The combination of these three ingredients aims to address different aspects of respiratory symptoms â€“ thinning the mucus, opening the airways, and facilitating its expulsion.
