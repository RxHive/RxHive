# Apixaban

**Generic Name:** Apixaban

**Usage:** Apixaban is used to prevent blood clots in people with certain conditions, including:

* **Atrial fibrillation (AFib):**  A type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of stroke. Apixaban reduces the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (blood clots traveling to other parts of the body) in patients with non-valvular AFib.
* **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE):**  Apixaban is used to treat DVT and PE and to reduce the risk of these conditions recurring after initial treatment.  It's also used for preventing DVT in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, apixaban can cause side effects.  Some common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most common and serious side effect.  Bleeding can occur anywhere in the body, and can range from minor bruising to severe internal bleeding.
* **Bruising:** Increased bruising is common.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.


**Serious side effects, while less common, require immediate medical attention and include:**

* **Severe bleeding (internal or external):**  Look for signs like unusual bleeding, dizziness, weakness, black stools, or blood in urine or vomit.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Liver damage:**  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.


This is not an exhaustive list, and the frequency and severity of side effects can vary from person to person.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of possible side effects and how to manage them.


**How it Works:** Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor.  Factor Xa is a key protein in the blood clotting cascade.  By blocking factor Xa, apixaban prevents the formation of blood clots.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking apixaban?** A:  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally okay, but excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of bleeding.  Discuss your alcohol consumption with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Can I take apixaban with other medications?** A:  Apixaban can interact with other medications, especially those that also affect blood clotting.  It's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Q: How long will I need to take apixaban?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your condition and individual needs.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
