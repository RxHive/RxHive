# Apixaban
### Generic Name
Apixaban

### Usage

Apixaban is a blood thinner (anticoagulant) that works by blocking a protein in the blood called factor Xa.  This protein is crucial in the blood clotting process. By inhibiting factor Xa, apixaban reduces the formation of blood clots.  Its primary uses are:

* **Treatment and prevention of blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) and lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE):** Apixaban is used to treat existing clots and to prevent new ones from forming after a DVT or PE event.
* **Stroke and systemic embolism prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF):**  Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots forming in the heart. These clots can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body, causing a systemic embolism. Apixaban helps reduce this risk.
* **Prevention of blood clots after hip or knee replacement surgery:** Apixaban is effective in preventing blood clots that can occur as a complication of these surgeries.

While less common, apixaban is sometimes used off-label in the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious condition where the body develops antibodies against heparin, another blood thinner.


### Dosage

Apixaban dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated and individual patient factors.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.  Here's a general overview.  **This information should not be used in place of your doctor's specific instructions.**

* **Treatment of DVT/PE:**  Typically starts with 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then reduces to 5 mg twice daily for a variable duration (often 3-6 months or longer, depending on the cause and recurrence risk).

* **Prevention of DVT/PE (after initial treatment):** A lower dose of 2.5 mg twice daily is often prescribed long-term.

* **Prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in AF:**  A common dose is 5 mg twice daily.  However, this may be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily for patients over 80, weighing less than 60 kg, or with a creatinine level above 1.5 mg/dL.

* **Prevention of blood clots after hip or knee replacement:** Usually 2.5 mg twice daily, starting 12-24 hours after surgery.

* **Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (off-label):** Dosage varies depending on whether the patient has thrombosis (blood clot formation) and the initial anticoagulant used.


Apixaban is typically available in tablet form.  Never crush or break tablets unless explicitly instructed to do so by your doctor or pharmacist.



### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):

* Bleeding (this can range from minor nosebleeds to serious internal bleeding)

Less common but potentially serious side effects:

*  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*  Spinal or epidural hematoma (bleeding around the spinal cord, potentially leading to paralysis)
*  Gastrointestinal bleeding
*  Increased liver enzyme levels


If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Apixaban selectively and reversibly inhibits factor Xa, a crucial clotting factor.  Factor Xa is part of the coagulation cascade that leads to the formation of thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin (the protein that forms blood clots).  By blocking factor Xa, apixaban prevents the formation of thrombin and subsequently reduces clot formation.


### Precautions

* **Bleeding:**  Apixaban significantly increases the risk of bleeding.  Avoid activities that increase the risk of injury.  Tell your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and especially other blood thinners (including NSAIDs).
* **Surgery and Invasive Procedures:** Inform your doctor and dentist that you are taking apixaban before any surgery or invasive procedure, including dental work.  Your doctor may recommend stopping apixaban temporarily.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Apixaban is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with kidney or liver problems.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of apixaban and are at increased risk of bleeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking apixaban?** A: It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor.  Excessive alcohol intake can increase the risk of bleeding.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about missed doses.

* **Q: How should I store apixaban?** A: Store apixaban at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I stop taking apixaban suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking apixaban suddenly without your doctor's guidance.  Stopping abruptly can increase the risk of blood clots.

* **Q: What are the signs of bleeding I should watch out for?** A: Watch for unusual bruising, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, dark or bloody stools, or any other unusual bleeding.
