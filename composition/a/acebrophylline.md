# Acebrophylline
### Generic Name
Acebrophylline

### Usage

Acebrophylline is a combination medication containing ambroxol and theophylline-7-acetate.  It's primarily used to treat and prevent acute and chronic respiratory illnesses marked by excessive mucus production and airway blockage.  These conditions include bronchial asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.  The drug works by combining two mechanisms:  theophylline relaxes the airways, while ambroxol thins the mucus and improves its clearance from the lungs.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Respiratory Diseases:**
    * Immediate-release capsules/gel/syrup: 100 mg every 12 hours.
    * Extended-release tablets: 200 mg once daily.

**Children:**  Dosage depends heavily on age and weight. Always follow a doctor's prescription.  Examples include:

* **Ages 2-3 years:** Pediatric gel/syrup (5 mg/mL): 0.2 mL/kg (1 mg/kg) every 12 hours.
* **Ages 3-6 years:** Pediatric gel/syrup (5 mg/mL): 5 mL (25 mg) every 12 hours.
* **Ages 6-12 years:** Pediatric gel/syrup (5 mg/mL): 10 mL (50 mg) every 12 hours.
* **Adolescents:**  Pediatric gel/syrup (5 mg/mL): 100 mg every 12 hours or as directed by a physician.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer specific dosage adjustments for mild to moderate impairment; use with caution.  It's contraindicated in cases of severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Similar to hepatic impairment, there aren't specific dosage adjustments for mild to moderate renal impairment; use with caution.  It's contraindicated in cases of severe renal impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Drowsiness, insomnia, restlessness, chills, excitement, fatigue, headache, numbness.
* Cardiovascular: Cold extremities, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), extrasystoles (irregular heartbeats), hypotension (low blood pressure).
* Gastrointestinal: Vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric pain, nausea, dry mouth, abdominal distention, anorexia, constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, heartburn, hematemesis (vomiting blood), oral paresthesia (numbness or tingling in the mouth), increased saliva production, stomach pain.
* Dermatologic: Skin rash, sweating, contact dermatitis, redness, facial swelling, pallor (pale skin), itching, hives.
* Endocrine and metabolic: Albuminuria (protein in the urine), hyperglycemia (high blood sugar).
* Genitourinary: Dysuria (painful urination).
* Hematologic: Leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count).
* Hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions.
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Prolonged muscle relaxation, tremor.
* Respiratory: Shortness of breath, rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal membranes), runny nose, rapid breathing.
* Other: Fever.

**Less Common (Less than 1%):**  Abdominal distress, abdominal pain, agitation, anorexia, dehydration, indigestion, and vertigo have been reported in post-marketing surveillance and case reports.


**Serious Side Effects:**  Though less frequent, serious reactions like anaphylaxis and severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious adverse effects occur.


### How it Works

Acebrophylline combines the actions of ambroxol and theophylline-7-acetate.  Theophylline, a bronchodilator, relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways, making it easier to breathe. It achieves this by increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within cells. Ambroxol, a mucolytic agent, thins and loosens mucus in the lungs, facilitating its removal.  Theophylline-7-acetate enhances ambroxol's absorption into lung tissue.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to acebrophylline, ambroxol, other xanthine derivatives (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline), or any formulation component.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Severe cardiovascular disease (including acute myocardial infarction and hypotension).
* Patients with diabetes using insulin or oral hypoglycemics (for gel formulations containing sorbitol).

**Warnings:**

Increased risk of anaphylaxis and severe skin reactions.

**Use with Caution:**

* Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or hypertension.
* COPD.
* History of gastric or duodenal ulcers.
* Mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.
* Hyperthyroidism.
* Severe hypoxemia (low blood oxygen).
* Obesity.
* Mild-to-moderate renal impairment.
* History of seizure disorder.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Avoid use during the first trimester of pregnancy. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; it's contraindicated while breastfeeding.
