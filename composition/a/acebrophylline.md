# Acebrophylline

**Generic Name:** Acebrophylline

**Usage:**

Acebrophylline is a bronchodilator used to treat reversible airway obstruction associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and asthma.  It's primarily used to relieve symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.  It's often used in combination with other medications for COPD management.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Heartburn
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Restlessness
* Tremors
* Increased urination
* Muscle cramps

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Seizures
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ characterized by swelling, rash, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

Acebrophylline is a theophylline derivative.  Theophylline relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways, widening them and making it easier to breathe.  It achieves this by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of the airway smooth muscles.

**FAQs:**

* **Is acebrophylline addictive?** No, acebrophylline is not addictive.
* **How long does it take to work?** The onset of action varies depending on the formulation and dosage, but effects are usually felt within 30-60 minutes.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking acebrophylline?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of some side effects, particularly those affecting the central nervous system (like dizziness, insomnia). It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while taking acebrophylline.  Consult your doctor.
* **Can I take acebrophylline with other medications?**  Many drug interactions are possible.  It's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) you are taking to avoid dangerous interactions.  Certain antibiotics, cimetidine, and others can significantly affect acebrophylline levels.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any serious side effects, such as chest pain, rapid heartbeat, or seizures, seek immediate medical attention. For less severe side effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist.
