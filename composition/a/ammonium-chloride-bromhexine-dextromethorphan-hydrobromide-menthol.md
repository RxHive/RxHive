# Ammonium Chloride + Bromhexine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Generic Name:** Ammonium Chloride + Bromhexine + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with coughs and upper respiratory tract infections.  The specific roles of each ingredient are:

* **Ammonium Chloride:** An expectorant; it helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
* **Bromhexine:** Also an expectorant; it works similarly to ammonium chloride to help clear congestion.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** A cough suppressant (antitussive); it works on the brain to reduce the urge to cough.
* **Menthol:** A topical counterirritant that provides a cooling sensation, potentially offering mild relief from throat irritation and congestion.  It may also have a slight decongestant effect.

This combination is generally used for productive coughs (those producing mucus) as the expectorants help clear the airways, and for non-productive coughs where the dextromethorphan can help suppress the cough reflex.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and dosage, but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach
* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache
* **Other:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  rare cases of liver damage (more associated with long-term high doses of bromhexine).


**How it Works:**

* **Ammonium Chloride & Bromhexine:** These expectorants increase the fluidity of respiratory tract secretions, making it easier to expel mucus through coughing.  They achieve this through different mechanisms, but both ultimately lead to less viscous mucus.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This acts centrally on the cough center in the brain, suppressing the cough reflex.
* **Menthol:** Works topically on the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, producing a cooling sensation and potentially causing a mild vasodilation effect that could ease congestion.
