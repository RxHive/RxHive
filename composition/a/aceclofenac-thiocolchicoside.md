# Aceclofenac + Thiocolchicoside
### Generic Name
Aceclofenac + Thiocolchicoside

### Usage
Aceclofenac + Thiocolchicoside is a combination medication used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders.  Its primary use is in managing the symptoms of acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, such as:

* **Osteoarthritis:**  Pain and inflammation in the joints due to cartilage breakdown.
* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  Pain and inflammation caused by an autoimmune response affecting the joints.
* **Ankylosing spondylitis:**  Chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the spine.
* **Soft tissue injuries:** Pain and inflammation resulting from sprains, strains, or other soft tissue trauma.
* **Post-surgical pain:** Pain following orthopedic or musculoskeletal surgeries.

While primarily used for musculoskeletal conditions, it's crucial to remember that this combination doesn't treat the underlying cause of the condition, only the symptoms.

### How it Works

Aceclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.  Thiocolchicoside is a muscle relaxant that helps to relieve muscle spasms and stiffness associated with musculoskeletal pain.  The combination aims to provide both anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant effects, offering broader pain relief.
