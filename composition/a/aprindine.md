# Aprindine
### Generic Name
Aprindine

### Usage
Aprindine is a Class Ib antiarrhythmic medication primarily used to treat both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias.  These are irregular heartbeats originating in the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart) or atria (the upper chambers).  It's used when other treatments haven't been effective or are unsuitable.  While its primary use is in managing these arrhythmias, it's crucial to remember that Aprindine should only be used under the close supervision of a cardiologist due to its potential side effects.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Oral:** The initial dose typically ranges from 150-200 mg per day, divided into multiple doses.  Doses may be increased to a maximum of 300 mg/day under close medical supervision for the first 2-3 days if necessary.  The usual maintenance dose is 50-100 mg/day, with a maximum daily dose of 200 mg.  ECG monitoring is essential during initial dose adjustment and periodically thereafter.
* **Intravenous (IV):** For ventricular arrhythmias, the dose is 2 mg/kg.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

The safety and efficacy of Aprindine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary for individuals with liver problems.  Use with caution and under strict medical supervision.
* **Renal Impairment:**  While the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for kidney impairment, use caution and close monitoring are essential.  Aprindine can be administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis without dosage changes.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Memory impairment
* Hallucinations
* Convulsions (seizures)
* Nausea
* Bloating
* Vomiting
* Tremor
* Diplopia (double vision)


Less common, but serious side effects include:

* Agranulocytosis (a dangerous decrease in white blood cells)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Cholestatic jaundice (a type of jaundice caused by bile duct blockage)


**Important:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Aprindine is a Class Ib antiarrhythmic drug. It works by blocking the fast inward sodium current in cardiac cells, interfering with the depolarization (electrical activation) of the cell membrane. This effect shortens the repolarization phase (the recovery period) of the heart's electrical cycle and the QT interval (a measure of the electrical repolarization of the ventricles).  By affecting these electrical processes, Aprindine helps stabilize the heart rhythm and reduce the occurrence of arrhythmias.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Aprindine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug, advanced heart failure, severe conduction disturbances (problems with the heart's electrical system), Parkinsonism, and convulsive disorders.

* **Use with caution:**  Aprindine should be used cautiously in patients with bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), hepatic or renal impairment, acquired QT syndrome (a condition affecting the heart's electrical rhythm), or impaired left ventricular function.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of Aprindine during pregnancy and lactation is unknown.  It should only be used in these situations if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Close monitoring is necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Aprindine?** A: Store Aprindine as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Aprindine suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking Aprindine abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can potentially worsen your condition.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Can Aprindine interact with other medications?** A: Yes, Aprindine can interact with other drugs, particularly other antiarrhythmics.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Q: Is Aprindine addictive?** A:  Aprindine is not considered an addictive substance.
