# Ambroxol + Guaifenesin

**Generic Name:** Ambroxol + Guaifenesin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of chest congestion and coughs associated with the common cold, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses.  Ambroxol acts as a mucolytic (thins mucus), making it easier to cough up phlegm. Guaifenesin is an expectorant, which helps to loosen and remove mucus from the airways.  It's important to note that this medication treats symptoms, not the underlying cause of the illness.  Always consult a doctor before use, especially for chronic or severe coughs.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Vomiting:** Throwing up.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Stomach upset:**  General discomfort in the stomach.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible, including rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.

This is not an exhaustive list, and more serious side effects are possible, though rare.  Stop taking the medication and seek medical attention immediately if you experience severe or unusual side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Ambroxol:** This drug stimulates the production of surfactant, a substance that helps to keep the airways moist and reduces the stickiness of mucus.  It also increases the activity of cilia, tiny hair-like structures in the airways that help to move mucus out of the lungs.
* **Guaifenesin:**  This expectorant increases the fluid content of the respiratory tract secretions, making the mucus less viscous and easier to expel through coughing.
