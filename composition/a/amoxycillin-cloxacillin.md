# Amoxycillin + Cloxacillin
### Generic Name
Amoxicillin + Cloxacillin

### Usage

Amoxicillin and Cloxacillin is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  It's particularly effective against infections caused by both Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria.  The primary use is for treating infections that are likely to be caused by bacteria susceptible to both amoxicillin (a penicillin antibiotic) and cloxacillin (a penicillinase-resistant penicillin).  

Common infections treated include:

* **Skin and soft tissue infections:**  Boils, abscesses, cellulitis, wound infections.
* **Respiratory tract infections:**  Pneumonia (in some cases), bronchitis (in certain situations where penicillinase-producing bacteria are suspected).
* **Bone and joint infections:** Osteomyelitis (in some cases).
* **Dental infections:**  Abscesses and other infections following dental procedures.

It's crucial to understand that this combination is not suitable for all bacterial infections.  A doctor will determine if it's the appropriate treatment based on the specific infection, the bacteria involved (identified through testing if necessary), and the patient's overall health.  The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics like this combination should be guided by a healthcare professional to avoid contributing to antibiotic resistance.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the individual's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and the specific formulation (e.g., capsules, suspension).  **Always follow the doctor's prescription exactly.**  Do not adjust the dosage on your own.

**This information is for general understanding only and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult your doctor for precise dosage instructions.**

* **Adults:** The usual dose may range from 250mg - 500mg of each antibiotic (Amoxicillin and Cloxacillin) given several times a day.

* **Children:** Dosage for children is calculated based on weight and should be determined by a pediatrician.  Liquid suspensions are often used for children.


**Administration:** The medication is typically taken orally (by mouth) with food to minimize stomach upset.  

**IV Administration:**  In severe cases, intravenous administration may be necessary, but this is done only under direct medical supervision in a hospital setting.  The dosage and schedule for IV administration will be determined by the physician.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach cramps
* Indigestion
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives)
* Vaginal yeast infections


Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate medical attention)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)
* Liver damage


If you experience any of these side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Amoxicillin and Cloxacillin are both penicillin-type antibiotics. Amoxicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, effectively stopping the bacteria from growing and reproducing.  Cloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, meaning it's effective against bacteria that produce an enzyme (penicillinase) that can break down and inactivate standard penicillins. By combining both, the drug addresses a broader spectrum of bacteria, including those resistant to amoxicillin alone.  This combination works synergistically, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with a history of penicillin allergy should not take this medication.  Inform your doctor about any allergies you have before taking this medicine.
* **Liver and Kidney Problems:**  The dosage may need adjustments for patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered after careful assessment of the benefits and risks by a healthcare professional.
* **Interactions:**  This medicine may interact with certain other medications. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.
* **Delayed Hypersensitivity:** Though less frequent, delayed-onset hypersensitivity reactions (skin rashes appearing several days after treatment begins) can occur.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication once I feel better?** A: No, it's essential to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to recurrent infection and antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is it safe to take this medication with other drugs?** A: Some medications can interact negatively with Amoxicillin and Cloxacillin. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other drugs or supplements.

* **Q: Can I consume alcohol while on this antibiotic?** A: Generally, alcohol consumption should be discussed with a doctor, as its effect when combined with Amoxicillin and Cloxacillin may depend on individual health conditions.
