# Amoxycillin + Cloxacillin

**Generic Name:** Amoxycillin/Cloxacillin

**Usage:** Amoxycillin/Cloxacillin is a combination antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections.  Its specific uses depend on the formulation and the severity of the infection, but common applications include:

* **Skin and soft tissue infections:**  Boils, abscesses, cellulitis, wound infections.
* **Respiratory tract infections:** Pneumonia (certain types), bronchitis (some cases).
* **Bone and joint infections:** Osteomyelitis.
* **Dental infections:** Abscesses, infections following dental procedures.


**Important Note:**  This combination is NOT effective against all types of bacteria.  It's crucial to have a doctor diagnose the infection and determine if this specific antibiotic is appropriate.  Inappropriate use can lead to antibiotic resistance.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, Amoxycillin/Cloxacillin can cause side effects, which can vary in severity. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  In some cases, more serious gastrointestinal issues like pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection) can occur.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rashes, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a medical emergency).  Amoxicillin is a penicillin, and those with penicillin allergies should NOT take this medication.
* **Other potential side effects:**  Headache, dizziness, fatigue, changes in taste, vaginal yeast infections.


**How it Works:** Amoxycillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that inhibits the growth of bacteria by interfering with the synthesis of their cell walls. Cloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, meaning it's effective against some bacteria that produce an enzyme (penicillinase) which can break down penicillin.  The combination provides broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria than amoxicillin alone.
