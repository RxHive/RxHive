# Acetaminophen + Phenyltoloxamine
### Generic Name
Acetaminophen + Phenyltoloxamine

### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used for the relief of mild to moderate pain and its associated fever.  Acetaminophen, an analgesic and antipyretic, reduces fever and pain. Phenyltoloxamine, an antihistamine, helps to reduce some of the symptoms associated with allergies and colds that can contribute to discomfort.  The combination aims to provide broader symptomatic relief than either drug alone.

### Dosage
**Important Note:**  Each tablet contains 25 mg of Phenyltoloxamine citrate and 325 mg of Acetaminophen.  Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist, and never exceed the maximum daily dose.

**Adults:** The usual adult dose is 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours, as needed for pain relief.  The maximum daily dose is 10 tablets (equivalent to 4000mg Acetaminophen).

**Children (Ages 6-11):**  The usual dose is 1 tablet every 4-6 hours. The maximum daily dose is 5 tablets (equivalent to 1625 mg Acetaminophen).

**Children (Ages 12 and older):** The usual dose is 2 tablets every 4-6 hours. The maximum daily dose is 10 tablets (equivalent to 4000mg Acetaminophen).

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturerâ€™s labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use with caution in these populations and consult a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Nausea
* Lassitude (fatigue)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) - especially with overdose
* Blood disorders (e.g., agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, discontinue use and contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Acetaminophen works centrally in the brain to reduce fever and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals that contribute to inflammation and pain signaling.  The exact mechanism is still debated, but it's not associated with significant anti-inflammatory effects in peripheral tissues. Phenyltoloxamine is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions. By blocking histamine receptors, it helps to reduce symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and runny nose, which can contribute to discomfort.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, phenyltoloxamine, or any component of the formulation.

**Interactions:** This medication can interact with several other drugs, notably MAO inhibitors (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), which can intensify its anticholinergic effects.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

**Warnings:**

* Excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of liver damage with acetaminophen.
* Use with caution in elderly patients, patients with liver or kidney disease, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, respiratory issues, or those performing tasks requiring alertness.
* Use cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women. While acetaminophen generally considered safe during pregnancy, the safety of phenyltoloxamine is less clear.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy.
