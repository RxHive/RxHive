# Afamelanotide
### Generic Name
Afamelanotide

### Usage
Afamelanotide is a medication used to increase the amount of pain-free time spent in sunlight for adults with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) who have a history of experiencing painful reactions to light exposure. EPP is a rare genetic disorder affecting the body's ability to process heme, a component of red blood cells.  This leads to a buildup of protoporphyrin in the blood, making the skin extremely sensitive to sunlight, resulting in painful burning and blistering. Afamelanotide helps by increasing the production of melanin, the skin's natural pigment that offers protection against UV radiation.  It's important to note that afamelanotide does *not* cure EPP; instead, it helps manage the symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life by enabling them to tolerate more sunlight.

### Dosage
Afamelanotide is administered as a subcutaneous implant. For adults with EPP, a single 16mg implant is inserted just above the anterior iliac crest (hip bone) every two months.  The implant is inserted by a healthcare professional.  The safety and effectiveness of afamelanotide in children have not yet been established.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in current manufacturer guidelines.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include nausea and injection site reactions.  Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

*   Fatigue
*   Dizziness
*   Drowsiness
*   Skin hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)
*   Skin irritation
*   Melanocytic nevi (moles)
*   Oropharyngeal pain
*   Cough
*   Respiratory tract infection

Less common but potentially serious side effects include exacerbation of porphyria.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Afamelanotide is a synthetic peptide that acts as an agonist for the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) in the skin.  By binding to this receptor, it stimulates melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) to produce more eumelanin, a type of melanin that provides better protection against UV radiation than pheomelanin. This increased melanin production helps protect the skin from the harmful effects of sunlight, reducing the pain and discomfort experienced by individuals with EPP.  The effect is independent of actual sun exposure; the drug works to increase melanin production even before sun exposure.

### Precautions
While no specific contraindications are listed, there is an increased risk of skin hyperpigmentation, including darkening of existing moles (nevi) and freckles (ephelides). There is also an increased risk of phototoxic reactions, even with afamelanotide treatment. Patients should continue to practice sun safety measures, including using sunscreen and limiting sun exposure, to further reduce risk.  The safety of afamelanotide during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  The decision to use afamelanotide during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a doctor, weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks to both the mother and the child.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does the Afamelanotide implant last?** A:  The implant is designed to release medication over approximately two months.  A new implant is needed every two months.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose (implant)?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss rescheduling the implant. Do not attempt to self-administer the implant.

*   **Q: Can I take other medications with Afamelanotide?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. While there are no known significant drug interactions currently listed, your doctor can help assess any potential interactions.

*   **Q: How should I store Afamelanotide?** A: Afamelanotide should be stored in the refrigerator.  Follow the instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.

*   **Q:  Can Afamelanotide be used to treat other conditions?** A: Currently, Afamelanotide is only approved for treating the symptoms of EPP in adults.  Its use in other conditions is not supported by clinical evidence.
