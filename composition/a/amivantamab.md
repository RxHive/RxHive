# Amivantamab
### Generic Name
Amivantamab

### Usage
Amivantamab is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's indicated for patients whose cancer has an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutation (a specific genetic change in the cancer cells) and whose disease has progressed after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.  This means the cancer has spread beyond its original location and has not responded adequately to previous treatment. Amivantamab is a targeted therapy, meaning it works specifically against cancer cells with the EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation.

### Dosage
Amivantamab is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage is determined by the patient's baseline body weight.  Premedications with an antihistamine (like diphenhydramine), an antipyretic (like acetaminophen), and a glucocorticoid (like dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) are typically given before each infusion to minimize potential side effects.

* **Patients weighing <80 kg:**
    * **Week 1:** 1050 mg total, split into 350 mg on day 1 and 700 mg on day 2.
    * **Weeks 2-4:** 1050 mg once weekly.
    * **Week 5 and onward:** 1050 mg every two weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

* **Patients weighing â‰¥80 kg:**
    * **Week 1:** 1400 mg total, split into 350 mg on day 1 and 1050 mg on day 2.
    * **Weeks 2-4:** 1400 mg once weekly.
    * **Week 5 and onward:** 1400 mg every two weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.


The specific premedication dosages and timing vary depending on the chosen medication, and a healthcare professional will provide detailed instructions.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of side effects.  Amivantamab is not approved for use in children.

### Side Effects
Amivantamab, like other cancer treatments, can cause side effects.  The frequency and severity of these side effects vary from person to person.

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities)
* Edema (swelling)
* Skin rash
* Pruritus (itching)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Abdominal pain
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Fever
* Infusion-related reactions (such as flushing, chills, or hypotension)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less frequently reported):**

* Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs)
* Ocular toxicity (eye problems)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (a severe skin reaction)
*  Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)


If you experience any concerning side effects, particularly serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Amivantamab is a bispecific antibody, meaning it targets two different proteins on cancer cells: the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET).  By binding to these proteins, Amivantamab disrupts their signaling pathways, which are crucial for cancer cell growth and survival. In some cases, it can lead to the destruction of cancer cells through mechanisms involving the immune system.  This targeted action helps to kill cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  There are no specific contraindications listed in the prescribing information, but individual patient factors will be considered by the prescribing physician.
* **Interactions:**  Amivantamab may interact with other medications, especially those affecting the immune system.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Amivantamab may harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for three months after the last dose.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for three months afterward.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are not routinely made for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment or for reduced kidney function, but careful monitoring is warranted.
* **Photosensitivity:** Patients should limit sun exposure and use sunscreen.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Monitor patients for infusion reactions during and after administration; premedication helps to lessen the risk.  

### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Amivantamab?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your response to the medication and the progression of your cancer. Your doctor will determine this based on your individual circumstances.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to discuss rescheduling your dose.

* **Q: How should I store Amivantamab?** A: Amivantamab is administered by a healthcare professional and does not require storage by the patient.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Amivantamab?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied. Your doctor can discuss potential long-term risks and benefits.

* **Q:  Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Amivantamab?** A:  Side effects such as dizziness and fatigue might impair your ability to drive or operate machinery. Follow your doctor's advice regarding driving and other activities.
