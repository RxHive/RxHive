**How it Works:** Armodafinil is a eugeroic, meaning it promotes wakefulness.  Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's believed to increase levels of dopamine and other neurotransmitters in the brain, leading to increased alertness and reduced sleepiness.  It is a prodrug of modafinil, meaning it's converted into modafinil in the body, but it is believed to have a more selective effect.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Armodafinil addictive?**  While not physically addictive in the same way as opioids, it can lead to dependence, meaning individuals may experience withdrawal symptoms if they stop taking it abruptly after prolonged use.  It should only be used as prescribed.
* **Can I take Armodafinil with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting Armodafinil, as it can interact with some drugs.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Armodafinil?**  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking Armodafinil, as it can exacerbate side effects and potentially lead to dangerous interactions.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Is Armodafinil safe for long-term use?**  The long-term safety of Armodafinil is still being studied.  It should only be used under the supervision of a doctor, and the benefits and risks should be regularly assessed.
