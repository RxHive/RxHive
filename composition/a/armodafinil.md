# Armodafinil
### Generic Name
Armodafinil

### Usage

Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in adults.  Its primary uses are for:

* **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):** Armodafinil helps combat excessive sleepiness associated with OSA, but it *does not* treat the underlying airway obstruction.  It's a symptomatic treatment to improve daytime functioning.

* **Narcolepsy:** This neurological disorder causes sudden, uncontrollable sleep attacks. Armodafinil significantly reduces the frequency and severity of these episodes, improving alertness and overall quality of life.

* **Shift Work Sleep Disorder (SWD):**  For individuals whose work schedules disrupt their natural sleep-wake cycle, Armodafinil helps manage the excessive sleepiness that results, improving performance and safety during work shifts.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and individual response.  Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Narcolepsy:**  The typical starting dose is 150-250 mg orally once daily in the morning. Your doctor may adjust the dose based on your response.

* **Shift Work Sleep Disorder (SWD):**  A single dose of 150 mg is typically taken approximately one hour before the start of the work shift.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Armodafinil in children have not been established. It should not be used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  In patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, dosage adjustment may not be necessary. However, individuals with severe hepatic impairment require dose reduction, as determined by their physician.

* **Renal Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for those with kidney problems.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate course of action.

* **Geriatric Patients:** Older adults may require lower doses, and close monitoring is crucial due to increased sensitivity to medication effects.


**Administration:** Armodafinil is typically administered orally as a tablet.  It can usually be taken with or without food.

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.


### How it Works

Armodafinil's exact mechanism of action is not fully understood.  It is believed to increase wakefulness by affecting neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly dopamine. While its precise interaction with dopamine is still under investigation, it's thought to modulate dopamine levels, influencing alertness and wakefulness.  It does not appear to act as a dopamine receptor agonist itself.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Armodafinil is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to modafinil, armodafinil, or any of its components. It should also be avoided in patients with certain cardiovascular conditions like angina, recent myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, or mitral valve prolapse.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Armodafinil can interact with several other medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, you are currently taking.  Particular caution is needed with MAO inhibitors (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, selegiline transdermal) and certain antiviral medications.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Armodafinil is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The decision to use Armodafinil during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, weighing the potential benefits against the risks to the mother and child.  Hormonal contraceptives may also be less effective.

* **Other Precautions:** Armodafinil should be used cautiously in older adults, patients with liver impairment, those with a history of psychiatric disorders (psychosis, depression, mania), substance abuse, or Tourette syndrome.  Avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Armodafinil can affect cognitive function.  Refrain from driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.
