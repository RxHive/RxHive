# Activated/Medicinal Charcoal
### Generic Name
Activated/Medicinal Charcoal

### Usage
Activated charcoal is primarily used as an antidote in cases of poisoning and overdose.  It works by binding to toxins in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. This is crucial in reducing the systemic effects of ingested substances.  Its use is most effective when administered within one hour of ingestion, ideally within 30-60 minutes. While it's not effective against all poisons (e.g., cyanide, methanol, iron), it's a valuable tool in managing many overdoses.  It's also sometimes used in managing intracranial hemorrhage associated with certain oral anticoagulants, though this is considered off-label use.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the age of the patient, the type and severity of the poisoning, and the chosen administration route (oral or nasogastric tube).  There is no single universally recommended dosage.  Consult the prescribing information and a medical professional for appropriate dosage for specific cases. The information below is for general knowledge and not a substitute for medical advice.

**Adult Dosage (Acute Poisoning/Overdose):**  A single dose can range from 25 to 100 grams. In cases requiring multiple doses, an initial dose of 50-100 grams may be followed by 25-50 grams every 4 hours.  

**Pediatric Dosage (Acute Poisoning/Overdose):** Dosages are weight-based.  For infants under 1 year, the recommended charcoal-in-water dose is 1 gram per kilogram of body weight or 10-25 grams. For children aged 1-12, the dose ranges from 25-50 grams; for adolescents, itâ€™s 50-100 grams. Again, multiple doses may be administered in some situations, typically every 4-6 hours.  However, multiple doses are reserved for life-threatening ingestions of specific substances and require close medical supervision.

**Important Note:** Co-administration of a cathartic (like sorbitol) with activated charcoal is generally not recommended due to the potential for severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

*   Abdominal distention
*   Constipation
*   Black discoloration of stool and mouth (temporary)
*   Vomiting


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects include:

*   Intestinal obstruction
*   Aspiration (inhaling charcoal into the lungs)
*   Respiratory failure
*   Corneal abrasion (if direct contact occurs)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Activated charcoal is a highly porous substance with a large surface area. This allows it to effectively adsorb (bind to its surface) many toxins and drugs within the gastrointestinal tract.  By binding to these substances, charcoal prevents their absorption into the bloodstream, minimizing systemic toxicity.  It's crucial to understand that activated charcoal does *not* absorb all toxins equally effectively, and its efficacy depends on the specific toxin's properties and the timing of administration.

### Precautions
*   **Contraindications:** Activated charcoal is generally contraindicated in cases of intestinal obstruction, an anatomically compromised GI tract, patients at risk of GI bleeding or perforation, those with unprotected airways (requiring intubation), and situations where aspiration risk is high. It is also not suitable for treating poisonings caused by caustics or hydrocarbons.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Activated charcoal can interact with many drugs and reduce their effectiveness. Discuss all medications and supplements with a healthcare provider before using activated charcoal.  Examples of interactions include the decreased efficacy of acetylcysteine, citalopram, dyphylline, methotrexate, and theophylline.
*   **Specific Populations:** Use caution in patients with impaired GI motility, volume depletion, and in neonates (due to the potential risk of gasping syndrome associated with benzyl alcohol-containing formulations). Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult a healthcare professional before use, but the treatment should not be withheld due to pregnancy.
*   **Administration:** Administer as a slurry (mixed with water or a suitable liquid) to facilitate swallowing and to ensure proper distribution within the gut. Avoid administering rapidly, which could lead to vomiting.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effects are generally seen soon after administration, but the full benefit depends on the specific toxin and how quickly it is removed from the gastrointestinal tract.
*   **Q: Is it safe?** A:  Activated charcoal is generally safe when used correctly under medical supervision. However, like any medication, it can have side effects.
*   **Q: Does it work for all poisons?** A: No, it's not effective against all poisons, particularly those that are rapidly absorbed or are already systemically distributed.
*   **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.
*   **Q: What should I do if I accidentally ingest it?** A:  Contact a poison control center or your doctor immediately.
