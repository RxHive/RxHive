# Alacepril
### Generic Name
Alacepril

### Usage
Alacepril is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's a long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, meaning it works by relaxing blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure. While its primary use is for hypertension, it's not typically used for other conditions.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical starting dose for hypertension is 25-75 mg per day, taken in one or two divided doses. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual response and renal function.  Patients with significantly impaired renal function (serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL) may require dose reduction or longer intervals between doses; however, specific guidance on dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment is limited in the manufacturer's labeling.  Those undergoing hemodialysis should start with lower doses and gradually increase as tolerated.  Alacepril is usually administered orally, and it's recommended to take it after meals.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of alacepril in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for pediatric use.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Drowsiness, dizziness, feeling lightheaded
* Cardiovascular: Facial flushing, palpitations
* Skin: Itching
* Liver: Elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase levels
* Gastrointestinal: Loss of appetite, altered taste, stomach discomfort
* Urinary: Protein in the urine
* Blood: Anemia, low white blood cell count, low platelet count

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) â€“ **Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.**
* Severe hypotension (dangerously low blood pressure)
* Severe kidney problems
* Blood disorders (agranulocytosis, etc.)
* Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)
* Cough (dry, persistent)

If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Alacepril is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, captopril, in the body. Captopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is an enzyme that plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure by converting angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. By inhibiting ACE, captopril reduces the production of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (relaxation of blood vessels) and a decrease in blood pressure.  Additionally, it decreases aldosterone secretion, promoting sodium and water excretion, further contributing to blood pressure reduction.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Alacepril is contraindicated in individuals with a history of angioedema related to previous ACE inhibitor use, hereditary or idiopathic angioedema, during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and in certain dialysis situations (specific membrane types).  It should also be avoided concurrently with aliskiren in patients with diabetes or renal impairment.  Avoid use with or within 36 hours of discontinuing a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril).

**Interactions:**  Alacepril's effects can be altered by numerous medications, including but not limited to NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics, and other antihypertensive agents.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.

**Warnings:** Use caution in patients with renal impairment, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, and in elderly patients.  Monitor blood pressure, kidney function (BUN and creatinine levels), and electrolytes regularly, especially during initial treatment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take alacepril with other medications?** A: Discuss all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, with your doctor or pharmacist before starting alacepril to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store alacepril?** A: Store alacepril as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking alacepril suddenly?** A:  No, do not abruptly stop taking alacepril without consulting your doctor.  Stopping suddenly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.

* **Q: Is alacepril safe during pregnancy?** A:  Alacepril is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Discuss birth control options with your doctor if you are of reproductive age.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience swelling of the face, lips, or tongue?** A:  This could be a sign of angioedema, a serious allergic reaction. Seek immediate medical attention.
