# Axicabtagene Ciloleucel
### Generic Name
Axicabtagene Ciloleucel

### Usage
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is a type of immunotherapy used to treat certain types of adult large B-cell lymphoma.  Specifically, it's indicated for:

*   Adults with large B-cell lymphoma that hasn't responded to the first line of chemoimmunotherapy (refractory) or that relapses within 12 months of the first-line treatment.
*   Adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This includes various subtypes like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.
*   Adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

It's important to note that axicabtagene ciloleucel is *not* indicated for primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.


### Dosage

Axicabtagene ciloleucel dosage is individualized and depends on the patient's weight and the number of CAR-positive viable T-cells.  It's crucial to understand that this is not a standard dose like many other medications.  Preparation is strictly for autologous use (meaning the patient's own cells are used), and identity verification is crucial before infusion.

**For Large B-cell lymphoma and Follicular Lymphoma:**

*   The target dose is 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-positive viable T-cells per kilogram of body weight.
*   The maximum dose is 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> CAR-positive viable T-cells.
*   Administration is intravenous (IV) after completing a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen (cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² IV and fludarabine 30 mg/m² IV given on days -5, -4, and -3 before axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion).  A leukodepleting filter should *not* be used.
*   Premedication with acetaminophen (650 mg orally) and diphenhydramine (12.5 mg IV or orally) is typically administered approximately 60 minutes before infusion.  The use of prophylactic corticosteroids may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel have not been established in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Axicabtagene ciloleucel can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.  It's vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately if any concerning symptoms develop.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

*   Nervous system: Aphasia, chills, delirium, dizziness, encephalopathy, fatigue, headache, motor dysfunction.
*   Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrhythmia, edema, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia.
*   Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, xerostomia (dry mouth).
*   Endocrine and metabolic: Dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium), hypophosphatemia (low phosphate), increased uric acid, weight loss.
*   Hematologic: Anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia (low immunoglobulins), leukopenia (low white blood cells), lymphocytopenia (low lymphocytes), neutropenia (low neutrophils), thrombocytopenia (low platelets).
*   Hepatic: Increased direct serum bilirubin level.
*   Hypersensitivity: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
*   Infection: Bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
*   Neuromuscular and skeletal: Back pain, limb pain, myalgia (muscle pain), tremor.
*   Renal: Renal insufficiency.
*   Respiratory: Cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), hypoxia (low oxygen), pleural effusion (fluid around the lungs).
*   Other: Fever.


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less frequent):**  These include but are not limited to severe CRS, neurological toxicities (encephalopathy, seizures, etc.), and serious infections.  Capillary leak syndrome, cardiac failure, and thrombotic events are also potential risks.

**Post-Marketing Surveillance:** Additional side effects such as quadriplegia and spinal cord injury have been reported after market release.

### How it Works

Axicabtagene ciloleucel is a CAR T-cell therapy.  The patient's own T-cells (a type of immune cell) are genetically modified in a lab to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that specifically targets CD19, a protein found on the surface of many B-cells, including cancerous B-cells in lymphomas.  These modified T-cells are then infused back into the patient.  The CAR-modified T-cells recognize and bind to CD19-positive cells, triggering their destruction and potentially eliminating the cancerous cells.  The process involves both direct killing of the cancer cells and the release of cytokines (signaling molecules) that stimulate the immune system to further combat the lymphoma.


### Precautions

*   **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** This is a potentially life-threatening side effect that can occur with axicabtagene ciloleucel.  Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms.  Treatment with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids may be necessary.
*   **Neurological Toxicities:** These are another serious risk, sometimes occurring concurrently with or following CRS.  Close monitoring and appropriate management are critical.
*   **Infections:** The risk of infection is increased due to the immunosuppressive effects of the therapy. Prophylactic antibiotics are often given.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Axicabtagene ciloleucel is not recommended during pregnancy due to the potential for fetal toxicity.  The information on excretion in breast milk is not known; risk vs. benefit should be considered for breastfeeding mothers.
*   **Interactions:**  Drug interactions are possible, and a healthcare provider should be informed of all medications the patient is taking.
*   **Other:**  Patients should be aware of the potential for prolonged cytopenias (low blood cell counts), hypogammaglobulinemia, hepatitis B reactivation, and secondary malignancies.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does treatment last?** A:  The infusion itself is relatively short, but patients require close monitoring for several weeks afterward.  The overall treatment duration depends on the response to therapy.
*   **Q: How is the medicine stored?** A: Storage and handling are complex and must adhere to specific guidelines defined by the manufacturer and the healthcare facility.
*   **Q:  What if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your healthcare provider immediately.  Treatment for certain side effects (like CRS or neurological toxicities) may be necessary.
*   **Q:  How long does it take to see results?** A: The time to see a response varies among patients.  Monitoring and assessment will be conducted regularly to determine effectiveness.
*   **Q: Can I take other medications while receiving this treatment?** A: Always discuss all current medications, over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins with your healthcare provider before starting treatment.
*   **Q: Is this treatment a cure?**  A: While axicabtagene ciloleucel can lead to remission in some patients, it is not a guaranteed cure for lymphoma.  Long-term follow-up is crucial.
