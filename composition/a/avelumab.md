# Avelumab
### Generic Name
Avelumab

### Usage

Avelumab is a type of immunotherapy medication, specifically a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor.  It works by blocking the PD-L1 protein, which is found on some cancer cells and helps them evade the body's immune system. By blocking PD-L1, Avelumab helps the immune system recognize and attack these cancer cells.

Its primary uses include:

* **Metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC):** This is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer. Avelumab is approved for treating adults and children 12 years and older with metastatic MCC.

* **Urothelial carcinoma (UC):** This is a cancer of the bladder and urinary tract. Avelumab is used in several settings for UC:
    * As a first-line maintenance treatment after initial platinum-based chemotherapy, when the cancer hasn't progressed.
    * For patients whose disease has progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy.
    * For patients whose disease progressed within 12 months of neoadjuvant (before surgery) or adjuvant (after surgery) platinum-based chemotherapy.


* **Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC):** Avelumab is used in combination with another medication, axitinib, for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC (kidney cancer).


### Dosage

Avelumab is administered intravenously (IV).  Dosage varies depending on the cancer being treated and the patient's weight.  Generally, the dose is either 800 mg every two weeks or 10 mg/kg every two weeks.  The 10 mg/kg dose is considered off-label in many instances.  Treatment continues until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur.

**Adults:** The most common dose is 800 mg IV every two weeks.  For advanced renal cell carcinoma, it's given in combination with axitinib.  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on liver or kidney function (see Dosage Adjustments section below).

**Children (≥12 years):**  For metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, the dose is 800 mg IV every two weeks.  Avelumab is not approved for children under 12 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are often necessary depending on the patient's overall condition, specifically regarding liver and kidney function, and the occurrence of side effects.  Premedication with an antihistamine and acetaminophen is usually recommended before the first few infusions to minimize infusion-related reactions.  Refer to the full prescribing information for detailed dosage adjustments in the presence of side effects.


### Side Effects

Avelumab can cause a range of side effects, some common and others rare but potentially serious.  Always inform your doctor if you experience any concerning symptoms.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash
* Weight loss
* Urinary tract infection
* Anemia
* Increased liver enzyme levels (AST, ALT)
* Muscle pain
* Cough
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Infusion-related reactions


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Colitis (inflammation of the colon)
* Kidney problems (nephritis)
* Immune-related endocrine disorders (thyroid problems, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Heart problems (myocarditis, pericarditis)
* Neurological problems (neuritis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)



### How it Works

Avelumab works by blocking the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein.  PD-L1 is a protein that is sometimes produced by cancer cells to evade detection by the body's immune system. By blocking PD-L1, Avelumab allows the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Avelumab is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components.
* **Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions:**  Avelumab can cause a range of immune-mediated adverse reactions affecting various organs. Close monitoring is crucial.  Corticosteroids are often used to manage these reactions.
* **Infusion Reactions:**  Infusion-related reactions can occur.  Premedication is often recommended.
* **Other Medications:**  Avelumab may interact with other medications, especially those affecting liver or kidney function. Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Avelumab may harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment or for at least one month after the final dose.
* **Specific Populations:** Patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disease require careful monitoring.


### FAQs

* **How is Avelumab administered?** Avelumab is administered intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes.
