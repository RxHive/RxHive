* **Microsatellite-unstable high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):** Used in cases where other treatments have failed.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, avelumab can cause side effects.  The severity and frequency vary among individuals. Common side effects include:

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list of side effects.  Serious side effects are possible, and patients should report any new or worsening symptoms to their doctor immediately.


**How it Works:** Avelumab is a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor.  PD-L1 is a protein found on some cancer cells that helps them evade the immune system.  Avelumab works by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor, PD-1, on T cells.  By blocking this interaction, avelumab helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.
