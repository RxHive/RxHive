# ANTI-PSORIATIC

It's impossible to provide details on a single "generic anti-psoriatic" because there isn't one.  Multiple classes of drugs treat psoriasis, each with various generic names and mechanisms of action.  To give you useful information, I'll provide details for a few common *types* of anti-psoriatic medications, focusing on their general mechanisms and common side effects.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for specific details on any medication.**


**Type 1: Topical Corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone, clobetasol)**

* **Generic Name (Examples):** hydrocortisone, fluocinolone acetonide, clobetasol propionate (many more exist)
* **Usage:**  Treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, primarily affecting the skin. Applied topically to affected areas.
* **Side Effects:** Skin thinning (atrophy), skin stretching (striae), burning, itching, increased risk of infection,  perioral dermatitis (around the mouth).  Long-term or high-potency use can have significant side effects.
* **How it Works:**  Suppresses the inflammatory response in the skin, reducing redness, scaling, and itching.
* **FAQs:**
    *  Can I use this on my face?  (Usually not recommended for high-potency corticosteroids, and only with short duration and doctor's recommendation)
    *  How long can I use it? (Limited duration use advised to prevent side effects)
    *  What if it doesn't work? (Your doctor may prescribe a different treatment)


**Type 2: Topical Vitamin D Analogs (e.g., calcipotriene)**

* **Generic Name (Examples):** calcipotriene, calcitriol
* **Usage:** Treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, primarily affecting the skin. Applied topically to affected areas. Often used in combination with corticosteroids.
* **Side Effects:** Skin irritation, burning, redness, dryness.  Rarely, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) with extensive use.
* **How it Works:**  Modulates the immune system's response in the skin and helps regulate cell growth.
* **FAQs:**
    * Can I use this on my face? (Generally safe for use on the face, but always follow doctor's instructions)
    * Can I use this with a corticosteroid? (Often used in combination for better efficacy)
    * What should I do if my skin burns? (Reduce frequency of use, consider consulting your doctor)


**Type 3: Systemic Medications (e.g., Methotrexate, Ciclosporin, Biologics)**

* **Generic Name (Examples):** Methotrexate, Ciclosporin,  many biologic agents (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, ustekinumab, etc. - each has its own generic name)
* **Usage:** Treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, often affecting a larger area of the body or resistant to topical treatments.  Administered orally (methotrexate), intravenously (some biologics), or subcutaneously (some biologics).
* **Side Effects:**  Vary widely depending on the specific medication.  Can include liver damage, kidney damage, infections, gastrointestinal issues, increased risk of cancer (with some medications), and many others. Biologics have unique side effect profiles.
* **How it Works:**  These medications act on the immune system to suppress the inflammatory processes underlying psoriasis.  Biologics target specific parts of the immune system.
* **FAQs:**
    *  What are the long-term effects? (Significant and vary by medication. Regular monitoring is needed.)
    *  What are the risks of infection? (Significantly increased with some of these medications)
    *  How often do I need to take this? (Varies widely depending on the medication and individual needs)
