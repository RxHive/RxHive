# Antihemophilic Factor (Human)
### Generic Name
Antihemophilic Factor (Human)

### Usage

Antihemophilic factor (human) is a crucial medication for individuals with hemophilia A (classic hemophilia).  Its primary use is to control and prevent bleeding episodes in these patients.  It's also vital in the perioperative management of hemophilia A, helping to minimize bleeding risks during and after surgical procedures.  Importantly, this medication is *not* indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand disease.

### Dosage

Dosage for antihemophilic factor (human) is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's weight, the severity and location of bleeding, their baseline factor VIII levels, and their response to the medication.  The dosage is expressed in units of factor VIII activity.  Determining the precise dosage often requires coagulation studies before and during treatment.  A general guideline is that administering 1 unit/kg of factor VIII will increase circulating factor VIII levels by approximately 2 units/dL.

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage strategies are categorized into intermittent bolus dosing and continuous infusion.  Intermittent bolus dosing involves calculating the required units based on the desired peak factor VIII level (determined by the World Federation of Hemophilia [WFH] guidelines based on bleeding location and severity), the patient's baseline factor VIII level, and their weight.  The formula used is: Factor VIII units required = [(desired peak factor VIII level – patient’s baseline factor VIII level) × body weight (kg)] / 2.  The frequency of repeat dosing depends on the manufacturer's recommendations and the patient's clinical response.  Continuous infusion is generally preferred for prolonged treatment (e.g., post-surgery), requiring an initial bolus followed by a continuous infusion rate adjusted based on frequent factor VIII assays and clearance calculations.  For routine prophylaxis, a typical dosage is 25-40 units/kg every 2-3 days, adjusted to maintain a trough factor VIII level of at least 1%, ideally 3-5%.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Similar to adult dosing, pediatric dosages are individualized based on the child's weight, bleeding severity, and response to the medication. A common formula for calculating the required units to raise blood levels is: Number of Factor VIII Units required = body weight (in kg) x 0.5 units/kg per units/dL x desired factor VIII level increase (units/dL or %).  WFH guidelines offer recommendations for various bleeding locations and surgical procedures, specifying desired peak factor VIII levels and administration frequencies (intermittent IV).  Continuous infusion may be used for prolonged treatment, with an initial bolus followed by an adjusted continuous infusion rate.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Inflammation at the injection site

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Increased factor VIII inhibitors (development of antibodies against the medication)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis – a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)

Other reported side effects (frequency not always specified) include: chest tightness, dizziness, altered taste, fever, headache, abdominal pain, bradycardia, bronchospasm, chest pain, chills, cough, cyanosis, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema, facial edema, fatigue, flushing, excessive sweating, hyperventilation, hypotension, irritability, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, red eyes, itching, skin rash, tachycardia, hives, visual impairment, and vomiting.

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Antihemophilic factor (human) supplies the missing or deficient factor VIII protein in patients with hemophilia A. Factor VIII is a crucial clotting factor involved in the coagulation cascade, the series of steps that leads to blood clot formation.  By supplementing this factor, the medication helps to stop bleeding and maintain hemostasis (the balance between blood clotting and bleeding).  Specifically, factor VIII activates factor X, which ultimately leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, forming a stable blood clot.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) to antihemophilic factor (human) or any component of the formulation.
* Hypersensitivity to mouse proteins (for products containing trace amounts of mouse protein).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* There's an increased risk of developing factor VIII antibodies (inhibitors) which can reduce the medication's effectiveness.
* Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible.
* There's a theoretical risk of transmitting infectious agents, although rigorous donor screening and viral inactivation/removal methods are employed.
* Use with caution in individuals with blood groups A, B, and AB.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Antihemophilic factor (human) is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. While factor VIII concentrations naturally increase during pregnancy, replacement therapy may be necessary in certain situations (invasive procedures, bleeding, etc.).  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding decisions should consider the risks and benefits for both mother and infant.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is antihemophilic factor (human) administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV), either as an intermittent bolus or continuous infusion.
* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the specific product; refer to the product label for detailed instructions.
* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: No significant interactions are currently known, but it's always advisable to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
