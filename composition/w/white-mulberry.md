# White Mulberry
### Generic Name
White Mulberry (Morus alba L.)

### Usage
White mulberry leaf extracts, particularly those standardized for 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) content, are primarily used to help manage blood sugar levels and improve lipid profiles.  While traditionally used for various ailments, current scientific evidence mainly supports its use in managing mild dyslipidemia (high cholesterol) and in assisting with blood sugar control, particularly in individuals with type 2 diabetes or those at risk of developing it.  Further research is needed to fully establish its efficacy in other conditions.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies considerably depending on the preparation and intended use.  There's currently a lack of standardized dosing guidelines, highlighting the need for more rigorous clinical trials.  

* **Mild Dyslipidemia:**  A typical dosage might involve 1 gram of white mulberry leaf tablets, standardized to contain 1.3 mg of DNJ, taken three times daily (TID).
* **Diabetes/High Cholesterol:** A common dosage recommendation is 1 gram of powdered white mulberry leaf taken three times daily (TID).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  There are no established, safe, and effective dosage recommendations for children.  Use in children should be avoided until further research is conducted and establishes safe and effective dosages.

**Important Note:**  The dosages mentioned above are based on currently available evidence, which is limited.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dosage for your individual needs and health status.  Self-treating can be dangerous.

### Side Effects
While generally considered safe, some individuals may experience:

* Contact urticaria (hives or rash)

Serious side effects are rare, but any unusual or concerning symptoms should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.

### How it Works
White mulberry's primary mechanism of action involves inhibiting alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the digestive tract.  These enzymes break down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars (glucose). By inhibiting these enzymes, white mulberry slows down the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream, leading to a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels after meals.  This effect may also contribute to improved lipid profiles by influencing carbohydrate metabolism.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** White mulberry should be avoided by individuals with known allergies or hypersensitivity to any of its components.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of white mulberry during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended due to the lack of safety data.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While currently limited, interactions with other medications, especially those affecting blood sugar or lipid metabolism, are possible.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking before starting white mulberry.
* **Monitoring:** Itâ€™s essential to monitor blood glucose levels regularly, particularly if you are using white mulberry to manage diabetes.
