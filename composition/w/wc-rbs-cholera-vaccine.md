# WC-rBS Cholera Vaccine
### Generic Name
WC-rBS Cholera Vaccine

### Usage
WC-rBS cholera vaccine is an oral, inactivated vaccine used to actively immunize against cholera caused by *Vibrio cholerae* serogroup O1 in adults and children aged 2 years and older traveling to areas where cholera is endemic or epidemic.  Importantly, it also offers protection against traveler's diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic *Escherichia coli* (ETEC) in the same age group visiting at-risk regions.  The vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies that fight against both *V. cholerae* O1 and ETEC.

### Dosage

**Cholera:**

* **Adults and children ≥6 years:**  Primary immunization involves two oral doses, given at least one week apart.  This course should be completed at least one week before travel to endemic/epidemic areas.  If more than six weeks pass between doses, the primary series must be restarted.  Booster doses are recommended: one dose 2-5 years after the primary series; if more than 5 years have passed, the primary series should be repeated.  For individuals with ongoing risk (off-label use), a booster dose every two years is suggested.

* **Children aged 2 to <6 years:** Primary immunization requires three oral doses given at least one week apart, completed at least one week before travel. If more than six weeks pass between doses, restart the series. Booster doses are recommended: one dose 6 months to 5 years after the primary series; if more than 5 years have passed, repeat the primary series. For individuals with ongoing risk (off-label use), a booster dose every six months is suggested.

**Enterotoxigenic *E. coli* (ETEC) Infection:**

* **Adults and children ≥2 years:**  Primary immunization consists of two oral doses at least one week apart, completed at least one week before travel. If more than six weeks pass between doses, restart the series. Booster doses are recommended: one dose 3 months to 5 years after the primary series; if more than 5 years have passed, repeat the primary series. For individuals with ongoing risk (off-label use), a booster dose every three months is suggested.

**Important Note:**  The vaccine should be administered orally after dissolving the contents in a prepared buffer solution (provided with the vaccine) to protect it from the stomach's acidic environment. Avoid consuming food or drink for one hour before and after vaccination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in less than 1% of recipients based on post-marketing data and case reports) may include:

* Abdominal cramps
* Abdominal pain/distress
* Chills
* Cough
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Fever
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash

Less common, but potentially serious, reactions like angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) and anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious adverse effects occur.

### How it Works

WC-rBS cholera vaccine contains killed *Vibrio cholerae* O1 bacteria and the recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB).  The CTB component is also effective against ETEC, as the toxin is similar to that of ETEC.  After oral administration, the vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies (both IgA and IgG) that protect against both *V. cholerae* O1 (both classical and El Tor biotypes, Inaba and Ogawa serotypes) and ETEC within the gastrointestinal tract. This antibody response provides protection against infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Do not administer the vaccine if the individual has a history of hypersensitivity to the vaccine, its components, or formaldehyde; or if they have an acute gastrointestinal illness or acute febrile illness (excluding minor illnesses like a mild upper respiratory tract infection).

* **Interactions:** Avoid administering the vaccine within three weeks of immunoglobulin administration.  A reduced immune response may occur if the vaccine is given concurrently with immunosuppressant drugs (e.g., antineoplastics, corticosteroids); concomitant use should be avoided.  Oral typhoid vaccine should not be administered within eight hours of WC-rBS cholera vaccine.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety and efficacy of this vaccine during pregnancy have not been established; it's not recommended for use in pregnant women unless the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use caution.

* **Other Precautions:** This vaccine does not protect against cholera caused by *V. cholerae* serogroup O139 or other *Vibrio* species.  It can be administered to individuals with HIV infection.  Antipyretics may be used to manage fever or discomfort after vaccination.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A: The duration of protection varies depending on individual response and the specific dosage regimen followed. Booster doses are recommended to maintain adequate protection.

* **Q: Can I take other medications with this vaccine?** A: Consult a doctor to discuss potential interactions with other medications, especially immunosuppressants. Avoid taking other oral medications or consuming food or drink for one hour before and after vaccination.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Most side effects are mild and transient.  However, if you experience severe side effects such as angioedema or anaphylaxis, seek immediate medical attention.  For less severe symptoms, consult your doctor or healthcare provider for advice.

* **Q: How should I store this vaccine?** A: Always follow the storage instructions provided with the vaccine.  Typically, this involves refrigeration at a specific temperature range to maintain its efficacy.

* **Q: Is this vaccine right for me?** A:  This vaccine is primarily recommended for individuals traveling to regions with a high risk of cholera or ETEC infection.  Discuss your specific needs and travel plans with your doctor to determine its suitability.
