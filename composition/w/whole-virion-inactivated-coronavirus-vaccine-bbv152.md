# Whole Virion Inactivated Coronavirus Vaccine (BBV152)
### Generic Name
Whole Virion Inactivated Coronavirus Vaccine (BBV152)

### Usage
The Whole Virion Inactivated Coronavirus Vaccine (BBV152), also known as Covaxin, is used for active immunization against infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  This vaccine is currently authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for individuals aged 18 years and older.

### Dosage
**Adults (≥18 years):**  The recommended dosage is two intramuscular (IM) injections of 0.5 mL each, administered 28 days apart (day 0 and day 28).  Always follow official recommendations for administration.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of BBV152 have not been established in children under 18; therefore, it is not recommended for this age group.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Injection site pain
* Swelling
* Redness
* Itching
* Headache
* Fever
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Body ache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rashes

Less common, but serious allergic reactions are also possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects after receiving the vaccine.  The exact frequency of these side effects is not defined in available information.


### How it Works
Covaxin is a whole-virion inactivated vaccine. This means it uses a completely inactive (killed) version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  When injected, this inactive virus triggers an immune response in the body. The immune system recognizes the virus as a threat and produces antibodies to fight it. This creates immunity, so if you're later exposed to the live virus, your body is prepared to defend against it.  The vaccine also contains an adjuvant (Alhydroxiquim-II) to enhance the immune response.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to any vaccine component.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* Individuals with fever or a severe infection at the time of vaccination.
* Individuals under 18 years of age.

**Use with Caution:**

* Patients on blood thinners (increased risk of bruising; use a fine needle (23-25 gauge) and apply firm pressure to the injection site for at least 2 minutes).
* Immunocompromised individuals (may have a reduced immune response).  While vaccination is recommended, the effectiveness might be lower.

**Drug Interactions:**  Chloroquine and corticosteroids may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I get Covaxin if I've already had COVID-19?** A: Yes, it's recommended to complete the vaccination schedule even if you've had a previous COVID-19 infection.  The duration of immunity after natural infection is not fully known.

* **Q: How is Covaxin stored?** A:  The vaccine should be stored between 2-8°C.  Opened vials should be used immediately and within 6 hours of opening while maintaining the temperature.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Most side effects are mild and temporary.  However, seek medical attention if you experience any severe or concerning side effects.

* **Q: Is Covaxin safe for people with chronic conditions (liver or kidney disease)?** A:  While vaccination is recommended for people with chronic conditions, including liver and kidney disease, the immune response might be lower in these groups.  It's crucial to discuss vaccination with your doctor to assess individual risks and benefits.
