# Warfarin

**Generic Name:** Warfarin

**Usage:** Warfarin is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) used to prevent blood clots from forming in people at risk of:

* **Stroke:**  People with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) are at high risk of stroke, and warfarin can significantly reduce this risk.
* **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE):** These are blood clots that can form in the legs (DVT) and travel to the lungs (PE), causing serious complications. Warfarin is used to treat and prevent these conditions.
* **Heart valve replacement:**  Following heart valve replacement surgery, warfarin helps prevent blood clot formation on the artificial valve.
* **Other conditions:** Warfarin may be used to prevent blood clots in other situations, such as after certain surgeries or in people with certain heart conditions.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects of warfarin can vary in severity and frequency.  Some common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:** This is the most significant risk associated with warfarin.  Bleeding can range from minor bruising and nosebleeds to more serious internal bleeding.
* **Nausea and vomiting**
* **Diarrhea or constipation**
* **Skin rash or itching**
* **Hair loss**
* **Fever**
* **Fatigue**


**Serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:**

* **Heavy bleeding:**  Bright red blood in urine or stool, black tarry stools, prolonged bleeding from cuts or gums, unusual bruising, coughing up blood.
* **Severe abdominal pain**
* **Signs of stroke:** Sudden weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking, vision changes.
* **Jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes)**


**How it Works:** Warfarin works by interfering with the production of certain clotting factors in the liver.  These clotting factors are essential for blood clot formation. By reducing the production of these factors, warfarin makes the blood less likely to clot.  It's important to note that warfarin doesn't break down existing clots, it prevents new ones from forming.

**FAQs:**

* **How often do I need blood tests?**  Regular blood tests (INR tests) are crucial to monitor how well warfarin is thinning your blood and to adjust the dosage as needed.  The frequency of testing varies depending on your individual situation, but it's often weekly or monthly at first, and then less frequently once a stable dosage is achieved.
* **What foods and drinks should I avoid?**  The amount of vitamin K in your diet can affect how warfarin works.  Consistency in your vitamin K intake is important.  Avoid significant changes in your diet without consulting your doctor.  Green leafy vegetables, certain oils, and some other foods are relatively high in vitamin K.
* **What medications should I avoid?** Many medications can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effect.  Always inform your doctor and pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Never double up on doses. Contact your doctor or pharmacist for instructions on what to do if you miss a dose.
* **How long will I be on warfarin?**  The duration of warfarin treatment depends on your individual condition and response to therapy.  It can range from a few weeks to a lifetime.
