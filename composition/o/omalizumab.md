# Omalizumab
### Generic Name
Omalizumab

### Usage

Omalizumab is a medication primarily used to treat moderate-to-severe allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU).  In asthma, it works by reducing the effects of immunoglobulin E (IgE), a key player in allergic reactions. By targeting IgE, omalizumab helps to lessen the severity and frequency of asthma attacks and reduce the need for oral corticosteroids.  In CIU (a type of chronic hives), it also targets IgE to decrease the severity of symptoms like itching and hives.


### Dosage

Omalizumab is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin). Dosage is individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's weight, serum IgE levels (for asthma), and the condition being treated.  

**Asthma:** The dosage for adults and children 6 years and older varies significantly depending on pre-treatment serum IgE levels and weight.  Detailed dosage charts are necessary, and these should be obtained from the product's prescribing information or a qualified healthcare professional. The dosage is typically given every 2 or 4 weeks.  It's crucial to follow the exact prescribed dose and schedule.

**Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU):** For both adults and children 12 years and older with CIU, the typical dose is 150 mg or 300 mg given subcutaneously every 4 weeks.  Dosage for CIU does *not* depend on IgE levels or body weight.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosing for asthma is complex and weight-based, with adjustments for IgE levels and given every 2 or 4 weeks.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dose for children.  Omalizumab is not typically used for CIU in children under 12 years.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, itching)

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Serious infections
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)
* Cerebrovascular events (stroke, transient ischemic attack)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those listed as serious, seek immediate medical attention.  Report any side effects, even minor ones, to your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to IgE.  In asthma, this prevents IgE from binding to receptors on mast cells and basophils, preventing the release of inflammatory mediators that trigger allergic reactions and asthma symptoms. Lowering free IgE levels reduces inflammation in the airways, leading to improved lung function and fewer asthma attacks.

In CIU, the mechanism is less fully understood but is believed to involve binding to IgE and reducing its levels, thereby impacting the inflammatory cascade that causes urticaria.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Omalizumab is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known severe hypersensitivity to the medication or its components.
* **Anaphylaxis:**  Patients should be monitored for at least 2 hours after the first three injections and 30 minutes after subsequent injections for anaphylactic reactions.
* **Infections:** Omalizumab may increase the risk of infections.  Report any signs of infection to your healthcare provider immediately.
* **Parasitic Infections:** Use with caution in patients with a high risk of parasitic infections.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Omalizumab is a Category B pregnancy drug (animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking). It's excreted in breast milk, so use with caution during breastfeeding. Consult your healthcare provider regarding the risks and benefits.
* **Interactions:**  Omalizumab may interact with other medications. Inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for omalizumab to work?**  A: The onset of effects can vary, but improvements in asthma control and CIU symptoms usually become noticeable within several weeks of starting treatment.
* **Q: How is omalizumab stored?** A:  Store omalizumab in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.
* **Q: Can I stop taking omalizumab suddenly?** A: No, always follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping treatment.  Sudden discontinuation may lead to a return of symptoms.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider to discuss the best course of action.
* **Q: Is omalizumab a cure for asthma or CIU?** A: No, it's a treatment to manage symptoms, not a cure.
