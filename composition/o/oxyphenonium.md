# Oxyphenonium
### Generic Name
Oxyphenonium

### Usage
Oxyphenonium is primarily used as an adjunct in the treatment of peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal).  Its anticholinergic properties help reduce gastric acid secretion, a contributing factor to ulcer development.  It's also used to relieve visceral spasms, which are painful involuntary contractions of the smooth muscles in internal organs.  This makes it helpful in managing conditions characterized by such spasms.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.

**Adults:** For inhibiting gastric acid secretion in peptic ulcer disease (as an adjunct) and for relieving visceral spasms, the typical oral dose is 5-10 mg.

**Children and Adolescents:** The oral dosage for inhibiting gastric acid secretion and relieving visceral spasms is generally lower, typically 3-5 mg.  However, pediatric use requires careful monitoring and precise dosage adjustments by a healthcare professional based on the child's weight and age.

**Dosage Forms:** Oxyphenonium is usually available in oral forms (tablets). Specific administration instructions should be followed as directed by the prescribing physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult your doctor if you have liver or kidney problems before taking oxyphenonium.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
* Constipation
* Urinary retention
* Blurred vision
* Dizziness
* Confusion

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (especially after a myocardial infarction)
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Oxyphenonium is an anticholinergic drug, meaning it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates certain muscle contractions and glandular secretions. Specifically, it acts by competitively inhibiting muscarinic receptors (M3 subtype) in the stomach and smooth muscles.  By blocking these receptors, it reduces gastric acid secretion and relaxes smooth muscles, relieving spasms.  It also exerts a direct relaxant effect on smooth muscle, independent of its action on receptors.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Oxyphenonium is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, urinary outflow obstruction, paralytic ileus (paralysis of the intestines), and myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disorder).

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients with tachycardia, hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, prostatic hypertrophy, raised intraocular pressure or angle-closure glaucoma are at increased risk for adverse effects and should use oxyphenonium with caution.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients are generally more susceptible to the adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs and should be monitored closely.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of oxyphenonium during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Drug Interactions:** The effects of oxyphenonium can be potentiated (increased) by other anti-muscarinic drugs, including amantadine, antihistamines, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
