# Oliceridine
### Generic Name
Oliceridine

### Usage
Oliceridine is an opioid agonist used intravenously in adults to manage acute pain severe enough to necessitate an intravenous opioid analgesic.  It's reserved for situations where alternative treatments (like non-opioid analgesics or other opioid combinations) are inadequate or not tolerated.  The primary use is for acute pain; there are no notable secondary uses outside of this indication.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  Due to the risk of addiction, abuse, and misuse associated with opioids, even at recommended doses, Oliceridine should only be used when other treatment options have failed or are unsuitable.

* **Intermittent Bolus Dosing (IV):**
    * Initial dose: 1.5 mg. A supplemental dose of 0.75 mg may be given 1 hour after the initial dose.
    * Subsequent supplemental doses (no more frequently than hourly) can be repeated and titrated based on patient response and tolerance.
    * Maximum single supplemental dose: 3 mg.
    * Maximum total cumulative daily dose: 27 mg.

* **Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) (IV):**
    * Initial dose (administered by a healthcare provider): 1.5 mg.
    * Demand dose: 0.35-0.5 mg.
    * Lockout interval: 6 minutes.
    * Supplemental dose (administered by a healthcare provider): 0.75 mg; can be repeated hourly as needed, starting 1 hour after the initial dose.
    * Maximum total cumulative daily dose: 27 mg.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Oliceridine in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Mild to moderate impairment doesn't require dosage adjustment, though less frequent dosing might be necessary. For severe impairment, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific adjustments; use with caution and consider an initial dose reduction.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Nervous system: Dizziness, drowsiness, sedation
* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, nausea, vomiting
* Dermatologic: Itching (pruritus)
* Neuromuscular/Skeletal: Back pain
* Respiratory: Low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Anxiety, headache, insomnia, muscle spasms, restlessness
* Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Dermatologic: Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), skin rash
* Cardiovascular: Flushing, low blood pressure (hypotension), high blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation, rapid heart rate (tachycardia)
* Endocrine/Metabolic: Hot flashes, low calcium, potassium, magnesium, or phosphate levels
* Hematologic: Anemia
* Hepatic: Increased liver enzyme (ALT) levels
* Local: Injection site extravasation (leakage)
* Respiratory: Cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Other: Fever

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Prolonged QT interval on ECG (dose-dependent), hives (urticaria), increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, drug abuse, opioid dependence, hypoventilation, and respiratory depression.

**Note:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works
Oliceridine is a full opioid agonist with relatively high selectivity for the mu-opioid receptor. Its primary action is analgesia (pain relief).  Like all full opioid agonists, it doesn't have an analgesic ceiling effect; dosage is adjusted to achieve adequate pain relief, but may be limited by side effects such as respiratory or central nervous system depression. The exact mechanism of its analgesic effect isn't fully understood, but it involves interactions with opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Known hypersensitivity to Oliceridine
* Significant respiratory depression
* Acute or severe bronchial asthma (unless in a monitored setting with resuscitation equipment readily available)
* Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction (including paralytic ileus)

**Warnings and Increased Risks:**

* Addiction, abuse, and misuse
* Life-threatening respiratory depression
* Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome
* Increased risk of profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death when used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants
* Potential for QT prolongation (especially with daily doses exceeding 27 mg)
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Severe hypotension
* Seizures (in patients with seizure disorders)
* Withdrawal syndrome and return of pain (with rapid tapering in physically dependent patients)


**Use with Caution:** In patients with hypovolemia, cardiovascular disease, those taking drugs that may worsen hypotension, those with conditions that increase QT prolongation risk, adrenal insufficiency, biliary tract dysfunction, severe hepatic impairment, morbid obesity, prostatic hyperplasia/urinary stricture, toxic psychosis, significant COPD/cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression, history of seizures, risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing, thyroid dysfunction, cachexia/debilitation, elderly patients, history of drug abuse/alcoholism, perioperative setting, or those performing tasks requiring alertness.


### FAQs

**Q: How long can I use Oliceridine?**
A:  Oliceridine is for acute pain and shouldn't be used for longer than necessary.  The duration of use beyond 48 hours hasn't been thoroughly studied.

**Q: Can I take Oliceridine with other medications?**
A:  Consult your doctor before combining Oliceridine with other medications, especially benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers, serotonergic drugs, mixed agonist/antagonist opioids, muscle relaxants, diuretics, or anticholinergic drugs, as these may interact dangerously.

**Q: How should I store Oliceridine?**
A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with your prescription.  Keep it out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance. Do not double the dose.

**Q:  What if I experience side effects?**
A:  Mild side effects may resolve on their own. For severe or persistent side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

**Q: Can I stop taking Oliceridine suddenly?**
A:  No.  Abruptly stopping Oliceridine can lead to withdrawal symptoms. If you need to discontinue use, your doctor will gradually reduce your dosage under close supervision.
