# Ozenoxacin
### Generic Name
Ozenoxacin

### Usage
Ozenoxacin is a topical antibiotic used to treat impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection.  This infection is typically caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus pyogenes*. Ozenoxacin is specifically indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 months and older.  It's important to note that ozenoxacin is for topical use only; it should not be ingested or used in other parts of the body such as the eyes, nose, or vagina.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children (2 months and older):** For impetigo, apply a thin layer of 1% ozenoxacin cream to the affected area(s) twice daily (BID) for five days.  The total treated area should not exceed 100 cmÂ² for individuals 12 years and older or 2% of the total body surface area (BSA) for those younger than 12 years,  whichever is less.  Always wash hands thoroughly after applying the cream.  A sterile bandage or gauze dressing may be used to cover the treated area.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, due to the low systemic absorption of topical ozenoxacin, adjustments may not be necessary.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance on dosage adjustments in patients with any pre-existing conditions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are rare with topical ozenoxacin, but potential side effects include:

* Rosacea-like facial eruptions
* Seborrheic dermatitis (a skin condition causing scaly patches)

While less frequent, serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning skin reactions, or if your symptoms worsen, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Ozenoxacin is a quinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial DNA replication. Specifically, it targets and blocks the activity of bacterial enzymes called DNA gyrase A and topoisomerase IV.  By preventing these enzymes from functioning, ozenoxacin effectively stops the bacteria from multiplying and helps to clear the infection.

### Precautions
* **Allergy:** Ozenoxacin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to ozenoxacin or any component of the formulation.
* **Superinfection:** There is an increased risk of fungal or bacterial superinfection (a secondary infection occurring on top of the initial infection).  If new or worsening symptoms appear, seek medical advice.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of ozenoxacin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding and consult your doctor before using it.
* **Children under 2 months:** The safety and effectiveness of ozenoxacin have not been established in children younger than 2 months of age.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Antagonistic interactions (where one drug reduces the effectiveness of another) have been observed between ozenoxacin and ciprofloxacin when used against *Staphylococcus aureus*. Discuss all medications you are currently taking with your doctor or pharmacist.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see improvement?** A: You should start to see improvement in your symptoms within three days.  If there is no improvement after three days of treatment, consult your healthcare provider.

* **Q: Can I use ozenoxacin on open wounds?** A:  Ozenoxacin is for use on impetigo.  Whether it's suitable for open wounds should be determined by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should I store ozenoxacin?** A: Store ozenoxacin at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of the reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I use ozenoxacin with other topical medications?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before using ozenoxacin with other topical medications to avoid potential interactions.
