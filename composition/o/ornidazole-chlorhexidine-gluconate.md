# Ornidazole + Chlorhexidine Gluconate

It's crucial to understand that **Ornidazole and Chlorhexidine Gluconate are not typically combined in a single generic formulation.** They are used separately for different purposes.  Ornidazole is an antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent, while Chlorhexidine Gluconate is an antiseptic.  Combining them would require a specific prescription from a doctor, and wouldn't be a "generic" off-the-shelf product.

Therefore, providing details as if they were a single generic formulation would be misleading and inaccurate.  Instead, I will provide details on each separately:
