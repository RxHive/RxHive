# Ormeloxifene
### Generic Name
Ormeloxifene (also known as Centchroman)

### Usage
Ormeloxifene is primarily used as a non-hormonal oral contraceptive for women.  It's also effective in treating dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), a condition characterized by irregular or excessively heavy menstrual bleeding.  Its mechanism differs significantly from hormonal contraceptives.

### Dosage

**Contraception:**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is 30mg twice a week for the first 12 weeks, starting on the first day of the menstrual cycle.  After 12 weeks, the maintenance dose is 30mg once a week, regardless of menstrual periods.  Consistent adherence to the schedule is crucial.

**Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB):**

* **Oral:** The initial dose is 60mg twice a week for the first 12 weeks. This is followed by a maintenance dose of 60mg once a week for the next 12 weeks.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Ormeloxifene is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Delayed menses
* Nausea
* Headache
* Weight gain
* Elevated blood pressure


Less common, but potentially serious side effects may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
Ormeloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). It acts on estrogen receptors in the body, exhibiting both weak estrogenic and potent antiestrogenic effects.  As a contraceptive, it prevents the thickening of the uterine lining (endometrium) necessary for implantation, and it also influences embryo transport. In treating DUB, it helps regulate the menstrual cycle by modulating estrogen receptor activity in the endometrium.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ormeloxifene is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, polycystic ovarian disease, cervical hyperplasia, a history of jaundice or hepatic impairment, severe allergic states, tuberculosis, renal impairment, pregnancy, and breastfeeding (within the first 6 months postpartum).
* **Drug Interactions:** Antibiotics like amoxicillin may reduce the effectiveness of Ormeloxifene.  However, studies suggest that NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) and rifampicin don't significantly affect Ormeloxifene's efficacy or metabolism during the pre-implantation period.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ormeloxifene is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding (within the first six months postpartum). Women who wish to conceive should discontinue use.
* **Missed Doses:**  If a dose is missed by 1-2 days (but less than 7 days), continue with the regular schedule but use a backup contraceptive method (like condoms) until the next menstrual period.  If a dose is missed for more than 7 days, restart the medication as a new user (bi-weekly for 3 months, then weekly).
