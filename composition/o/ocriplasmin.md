# Ocriplasmin
### Generic Name
Ocriplasmin

### Usage
Ocriplasmin is a medication used to treat symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMA).  VMA is a condition where the vitreous gel (the clear, jelly-like substance filling the eye) adheres to the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. This adhesion can cause vision distortion, floaters, and reduced visual acuity. Ocriplasmin works by dissolving the protein connections causing the adhesion, thereby potentially improving vision.  It's important to note that the manufacturing and distribution of Ocriplasmin was discontinued in May 2020.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For vitreomacular adhesion, the recommended dose is a single 0.125 mg intravitreal injection into the affected eye.  Repeated injections into the same eye are not recommended. If treatment of the second eye is necessary, it shouldn't be done within 7 days of the first injection.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Ocriplasmin is not recommended for use in children as its safety and effectiveness haven't been established in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, adjustments are unlikely to be necessary because of the drug's low systemic absorption (minimal absorption into the bloodstream).

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (5-20%):**

* Intraocular inflammation
* Decreased visual acuity (blurred vision)
* Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the conjunctiva, the white part of the eye)
* Eye pain
* Macular degeneration (worsening of the macula)
* Photopsia (seeing flashes of light)
* Retinal edema (swelling of the retina)
* Visual impairment
* Vitreous opacity (cloudiness in the vitreous gel)

**Less Common Side Effects (<5%):**

* Hyperemia (redness)
* Chromatopsia (seeing colors differently)
* Abnormal electroretinogram (a test measuring the retina's electrical activity)
* Anterior chamber inflammation
* Cataract
* Conjunctival hyperemia
* Decreased pupillary reflex
* Dry eye syndrome
* Eye discomfort
* Increased intraocular pressure
* Iritis (inflammation of the iris)
* Macular edema
* Metamorphopsia (distorted vision)
* Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
* Retinal degeneration
* Visual disturbance (in the unaffected eye)
* Vitreous detachment

**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Nocturnal amblyopia (reduced vision at night)
* Retinal detachment (before vitrectomy surgery)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ocriplasmin is a modified form of plasmin, a naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down proteins. It targets specific proteins in the vitreous gel and the vitreoretinal interface (the area where the vitreous gel meets the retina). By breaking down these proteins, ocriplasmin helps to dissolve the adhesions responsible for vitreomacular adhesion, potentially restoring normal vision.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ocriplasmin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to ocriplasmin or any component of the formulation, and in those with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections.

**Increased Risk:**  Use of ocriplasmin increases the risk of decreased visual acuity, dyschromatopsia (color vision defects), intraocular inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, increased intraocular pressure, and lens subluxation (displacement of the eye lens). There's also an increased risk of retinal detachment or retinal tear, with or without retinal detachment.

**Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using ocriplasmin in breastfeeding women.  The excretion of ocriplasmin in breast milk is unknown.

**General Precautions:** Ocriplasmin is intended for a single intravitreal injection only.  Proper aseptic technique and the use of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent are crucial to avoid infection.  Patients should be advised to immediately consult an ophthalmologist if they experience any eye redness, sensitivity to light, pain, or changes in vision. Patients should avoid driving or operating machinery until their vision improves after injection.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Ocriplasmin administered?** A:  It is administered via a single intravitreal injection by a qualified ophthalmologist.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effect varies, with some patients seeing improvements relatively quickly, while others might not experience noticeable changes.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A:  Long-term studies are limited due to the discontinuation of the drug, but available data does not show long-term issues.
* **Q: Is Ocriplasmin still available?** A: No, the manufacturing and distribution of Ocriplasmin was discontinued.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your ophthalmologist immediately.  Some side effects can be serious.
* **Q:  Can I store Ocriplasmin at home?** A: Ocriplasmin is a prescription medication that should be stored and handled by qualified medical professionals.  It is not intended for home storage.
