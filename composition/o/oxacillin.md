# Oxacillin
### Generic Name
Oxacillin

### Usage
Oxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin antibiotic.  Its primary use is to treat infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci (bacteria that produce an enzyme that breaks down penicillin) that are susceptible to oxacillin.  Penicillinase-producing *Staphylococcus aureus* (*S. aureus*) is a common target.  It's often used as empiric therapy (treatment before specific test results are available) when a resistant staphylococcal infection is suspected.  Oxacillin is *not* the appropriate choice for infections caused by bacteria susceptible to standard penicillin (like penicillin G).  It's used to treat a range of infections, including skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis (bone infection), and endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), though its use in some of these conditions might be considered off-label depending on local guidelines and the specific bacterial strain involved.  The specific infections it's used for depend on susceptibility testing and local guidelines.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the infection's severity, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous).  Always follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions. The information below is for general knowledge and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults:**

* **Oral:** 0.5-1 g every 4-6 hours.
* **Intramuscular (IM) / Intravenous (IV):**  Dosage ranges from 250-500 mg every 4-6 hours for mild to moderate infections, increasing to 1-2 g every 4-6 hours for severe infections.  Higher doses, sometimes reaching 12 g/day divided into multiple doses, might be used in severe cases like endocarditis, often requiring prolonged treatment. The regimen for severe infections like endocarditis frequently involves combinations with other antibiotics like rifampin or gentamicin.


**Children:**  Pediatric dosing is complex and weight-based. Neonatal dosing differs significantly from that of older children.  Dosages range from 50-200 mg/kg/day, divided into multiple doses (every 4-8 hours).  Maximum daily doses also vary depending on age and the severity of the infection.  A healthcare provider should always determine the appropriate dose for a child.

**Important Note:**  The information above provides a general range; precise dosing instructions must be obtained from a healthcare professional.  They will consider factors like kidney and liver function, which may require dose adjustments.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Rash

Less common but serious side effects:

* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (causing severe diarrhea)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Kidney damage (nephritis)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to life-threatening anaphylaxis)
* Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)


If any adverse effects occur, especially severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Oxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. It works by interfering with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls.  By inhibiting the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis, oxacillin weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to bacterial cell death (bactericidal action).  Its penicillinase resistance stems from its chemical structure; it is less susceptible to breakdown by the penicillinase enzyme produced by certain bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Oxacillin is contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or any of its components.  Those with a history of allergies or asthma should be closely monitored.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments might be necessary in patients with reduced kidney function, due to the risk of oxacillin accumulation and potential toxicity.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** While specific dose adjustments aren't routinely recommended, close monitoring is important.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Oxacillin is a category B pregnancy drug (meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking).  Itâ€™s excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers need careful monitoring and assessment of the risks and benefits.
* **Drug Interactions:** Oxacillin can interact with other medications, including aminoglycosides, oral contraceptives, and anticoagulants.  Inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Superinfections:**  Oxacillin can disrupt the normal gut flora, potentially leading to secondary fungal or bacterial infections (such as *C. difficile* colitis).

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take oxacillin with alcohol?** A: It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while on antibiotics.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: How should I store oxacillin?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: How long does it take for oxacillin to work?** A:  This varies depending on the infection and the individual.  You may see improvement within a few days, but complete treatment is crucial.
* **Q: Is oxacillin effective against all bacterial infections?** A: No, it's only effective against specific bacteria, primarily penicillinase-producing staphylococci that are susceptible to the drug.  Susceptibility testing is vital to ensure the right choice of antibiotic.
