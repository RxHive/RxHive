# Omadacycline
### Generic Name
Omadacycline

### Usage
Omadacycline is a tetracycline antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.  Its primary uses are for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (a lung infection) and acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (infections of the skin and tissues beneath).  It's crucial to understand that omadacycline should only be used to treat infections confirmed or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria susceptible to this medication.  Using it for other conditions or infections not caused by susceptible bacteria won't be effective and may contribute to antibiotic resistance.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the infection and whether the medication is administered intravenously (IV) or orally.

* **Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia:**
    * **IV:** A loading dose of 200mg as a single dose on day 1, or 100mg twice daily (BID) on day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 100mg once daily (OD) for 7-14 days.
    * **Oral:** 300mg OD for 7-14 days.
* **Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections:**
    * **IV:** A loading dose of 200mg as a single dose on day 1, or 100mg BID on day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 100mg OD for 7-14 days.
    * **Oral:** 450mg OD on days 1 and 2, then 300mg OD for 7-14 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of omadacycline in children under 8 years old haven't been established.  Use in this age group is not recommended due to potential for reversible inhibition of bone growth, tooth enamel hypoplasia, and permanent tooth discoloration.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, always consult a healthcare professional for individual guidance, especially if there's significant impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include nausea and vomiting.

Side effects affecting 1-10% of patients include:

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Lethargy
* Vertigo
* Hypertension
* Insomnia
* Atrial fibrillation
* Tachycardia
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Abdominal pain
* Taste disturbances (dysgeusia)
* Indigestion (dyspepsia)
* Increased serum lipase levels
* Oral thrush (oral candidiasis)
* Skin redness (erythema)
* Excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)
* Itching (pruritus)
* Hives (urticaria)
* Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels
* Vulvovaginal candidiasis
* Anemia
* Increased platelet count (thrombocythemia)
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin)
* Allergic reactions (hypersensitivity reactions)
* Infusion site reactions (if given intravenously)
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels
* Oropharyngeal pain


Serious, but less common side effects, include 
Clostridioides difficile infection (a serious intestinal infection),  and  anaphylactic reactions.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.  This list isn't exhaustive; other side effects are possible.

### How it Works

Omadacycline is a member of the tetracycline class of antibiotics.  It works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria.  Ribosomes are essential for bacterial protein synthesis. By binding to the ribosome, omadacycline prevents the bacteria from producing necessary proteins, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death and resolving the infection.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Omadacycline is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to omadacycline, other tetracycline-class antibiotics, or any component of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Omadacycline can interact with numerous other medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting omadacycline.  Some interactions may decrease the effectiveness of omadacycline or increase the risk of side effects. Specific interactions are detailed in the full prescribing information.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tetracyclines, including omadacycline, can cause fetal harm.  Use during pregnancy is generally avoided unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during omadacycline treatment or for 4 days after the final dose because excretion in breast milk is unknown. Effective contraception is recommended for females of reproductive potential during therapy.
* **Children:** Avoid using omadacycline in children under 8 years old due to the potential for permanent tooth discoloration and bone growth inhibition.
* **Other Warnings:** Omadacycline can cause photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), so use sunscreen and protective clothing when exposed to sunlight.  Monitor for signs of superinfection (new infection developing due to the suppression of normal flora by the antibiotic). Always complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if symptoms improve.  Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take omadacycline with food?** A: No, for optimal absorption, take oral omadacycline on an empty stomach (at least 4 hours after a meal). Avoid food and beverages (except water) for 2 hours after taking the medication. Avoid dairy products and other products containing multivalent cations (like antacids and some multivitamins) for 4 hours after taking omadacycline.

* **Q: How should I store omadacycline?** A: Store omadacycline as directed on the label.  IV formulations may require specific storage and handling.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A: Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking omadacycline?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  While there isn't a specific contraindication, alcohol can sometimes exacerbate side effects, particularly gastrointestinal upset.

* **Q: Will omadacycline cure all bacterial infections?** A: No. Omadacycline is only effective against specific bacteria susceptible to its effects.  The prescribing physician will assess whether omadacycline is appropriate for your specific infection based on laboratory test results.
