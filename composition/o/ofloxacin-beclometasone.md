# Ofloxacin + Beclometasone

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Beclometasone Dipropionate (Note:  The combination is not always marketed with both names explicitly stated.  You may see variations.)


**Usage:** This combination is typically used to treat bacterial and fungal infections of the ear, specifically otitis externa (swimmer's ear).  Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, targets bacteria, while beclometasone dipropionate, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and itching.  **Important:** This is not a first-line treatment for ear infections and should only be used as prescribed by a doctor.


**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary, but common ones may include:

* **Local effects (in the ear):** Burning, stinging, itching, irritation, temporary hearing loss.
* **Systemic effects (affecting the whole body):**  These are less common with ear drops but can occur, especially with prolonged use or if the eardrum is perforated.  They can include dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  increased blood sugar, and changes in mood or behavior.  Allergic reactions are possible.


**How it Works:**

* **Ofloxacin:**  This antibiotic works by interfering with the bacterial DNA replication and repair processes, ultimately killing the bacteria causing the infection.  It is effective against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

* **Beclometasone Dipropionate:**  This corticosteroid reduces inflammation by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells in the ear canal. This helps to reduce pain, itching, and swelling.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I use this for other infections?** A: No. This combination is specifically formulated for ear infections.  Do not use it for eye infections, skin infections, or other conditions without a doctor's explicit instruction.

* **Q: How long should I use it?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Treatment duration varies depending on the severity of the infection.  Improper or prolonged use can lead to side effects or antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What if I have a perforated eardrum?** A: You should **not** use this medication if you have a perforated eardrum.  The medication can enter the middle ear and cause serious complications.  Inform your doctor immediately.

* **Q: Can I use it while pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The benefits must outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  If you experience severe or persistent side effects, stop using the medication and consult your doctor immediately.

* **Q: Is this available over-the-counter?** A: Usually not.  This combination medication requires a prescription.
