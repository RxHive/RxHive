# Oxybuprocaine [Benoxinate]
### Generic Name
Oxybuprocaine (also known as Benoxinate)

### Usage
Oxybuprocaine is a local anesthetic primarily used to numb the eye for short ophthalmological (eye-related) procedures.  This means it temporarily eliminates pain and sensation in the eye, making procedures like removing foreign bodies, minor eye surgeries, or tonometry (measuring eye pressure) more comfortable for the patient.  While its primary use is in ophthalmology, it's specifically formulated for topical application to the eye and isn't suitable for other anesthetic uses.


### Dosage
The usual dose is a 0.4% ophthalmic solution.  Dosage varies depending on the procedure:

* **Ophthalmological Anesthesia (Adults and Children):**  Instill 1 drop into each eye. For deeper anesthesia or more extensive procedures, additional drops may be instilled at intervals greater than 90 seconds.  The total number of drops needed will vary.  For example:
    * Most procedures: 1-2 drops per eye are sufficient.
    * Removal of foreign bodies or minor surgery: 3-6 drops per eye may be necessary.
    * Pterygium surgery: 1 drop per minute for 10 minutes is often used.
    * Tonometry: 1 drop is usually sufficient after a 1-minute waiting period.

* **Pediatric Use:** The dosage for children and adolescents is the same as for adults.  However, always follow the guidance of a healthcare professional for pediatric use.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to current manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes
* Transient blurred vision
* Eye irritation (blepharitis)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Corneal damage (especially with frequent or chronic use)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis in rare cases)
* Iritis (inflammation of the iris)
* Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea)
* Ocular edema (swelling of the eye)


If you experience any adverse effects, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Oxybuprocaine is a fast-acting local anesthetic that works by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses along sensory nerves in the eye.  This prevents pain signals from reaching the brain, resulting in a temporary numbing effect.  It's a short-acting anesthetic, meaning its effects wear off relatively quickly.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Oxybuprocaine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to oxybuprocaine, other ester-type local anesthetics, or any of the formulation's components;  patients with eye infections; and those attempting self-instillation.
* **Interactions:** Oxybuprocaine may interact with other medications, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, hyaluronidase, and methemoglobinemia-associated agents. It may also affect the levels or effects of some other drugs like technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept and bupivacaine (liposomal). Consult a healthcare professional about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  The potential for blurred vision exists and may impair visual acuity.  Prolonged use increases the risk of corneal damage, keratitis, and tolerance. Systemic absorption, while less likely with topical ophthalmic use, is a potential concern.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of oxybuprocaine during pregnancy and lactation hasn't been fully established. Consult your doctor or healthcare provider before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does oxybuprocaine last?**  A: The duration of action is relatively short, typically lasting only for a short period, depending on the dose and the procedure.
* **Q: Can I drive after using oxybuprocaine?** A: No, because blurred vision is a possible side effect. Avoid driving or operating machinery until your vision clears.
* **Q: How should I store oxybuprocaine?** A: Store it according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: Is oxybuprocaine safe for long-term use?** A: No, prolonged use increases the risk of several side effects, including corneal damage. Itâ€™s intended for short-term use in specific ophthalmological procedures.
* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get oxybuprocaine in my eyes?** A: If you accidentally get it in your eyes, follow the instructions provided with the medication and seek medical advice immediately if you experience any adverse effects.
