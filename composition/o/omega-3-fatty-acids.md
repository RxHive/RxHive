# Omega-3 Fatty Acids
### Generic Name
Omega-3 Fatty Acids

### Usage
Omega-3 fatty acids are primarily used as dietary supplements for individuals at increased risk of coronary artery disease.  They are also used as an adjunct to diet to lower serum triglyceride levels in adults with severely high triglycerides (≥500 mg/dL).  While research is ongoing, omega-3s are also being explored for their potential role in managing conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, showing promise in reducing morning stiffness and joint tenderness.  Note that the use of omega-3s for conditions beyond hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular health is still under investigation and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
Dosage varies considerably depending on the reason for taking omega-3s and the specific product formulation.  Always follow the instructions on your specific product label.

**Adults:**

* **Dietary Supplement:** The recommended dietary intake (RDI) varies by age and sex (see below).  Supplements typically contain varying amounts of EPA and DHA and instructions will vary. A common dosage recommendation is 1-2 capsules three times a day (TID), though this is highly variable.
* **Hypertriglyceridemia:**  A typical dosage range is 4 grams once daily (OD) or 2 grams twice daily (BID).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The RDI for children also varies widely based on age. The following are recommended dietary intakes; supplement use should be guided by a healthcare provider.

* Birth to 6 months: 0.5 g
* 7-12 months: 0.5 g
* 1-3 years: 0.7 g
* 4-8 years: 0.9 g
* 9-13 years: Males 1.2 g, Females 1.0 g
* 14-18 years: Males 1.6 g, Females 1.1 g


**Important Note:**  The amount of EPA and DHA in different supplements varies greatly.  Always check the product label to determine the specific dosage of these active components.


### Side Effects

**Common (1-10%):**

* Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (cardiovascular)
* Dysgeusia (altered taste), dyspepsia (indigestion), and eructation (belching) (gastrointestinal)

**Less Common (frequency not specified):**

* Pruritus (itching) and skin rash (dermatologic)
* Increased LDL cholesterol (endocrine and metabolic)
* Constipation and vomiting (gastrointestinal)
* Increased serum ALT and AST (liver enzymes) (hepatic)

**Post-Marketing (frequency unknown):**

* Urticaria (hives) (dermatologic)
* Bleeding tendency (hematologic and oncologic)
* Anaphylaxis (hypersensitivity)


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Omega-3 fatty acids, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), reduce the liver's production of triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). This occurs through several mechanisms, including:  inhibiting the enzyme that helps make triglycerides, increasing the breakdown of triglycerides in the liver's mitochondria and peroxisomes, and reducing the liver's overall triglyceride synthesis.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Omega-3 fatty acids are contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to omega-3 fatty acids or any component of the formulation.

**Increased Risk:**  Omega-3s may increase the risk of bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and elevated LDL cholesterol levels in some individuals.

**Use with Caution:**  Omega-3 supplements should be used cautiously in people with known allergies or sensitivities to fish and shellfish, or those with bleeding disorders (coagulopathy).

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Omega-3 fatty acids are considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding within recommended dietary intakes, but higher supplement doses should be taken only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take Omega-3s with other medications?**
A:  Some medications, particularly blood thinners, can interact with omega-3s. It’s essential to discuss any supplements with your doctor or pharmacist, particularly if you are on other medications.

**Q: How should I store Omega-3 supplements?**
A: Store omega-3 supplements in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat, to maintain their potency.

**Q: Are Omega-3s safe for everyone?**
A:  While generally safe, omega-3s can have side effects and may interact with other medications. It is vital to consult your doctor before starting any supplement, particularly if you have underlying health conditions.

**Q: How long does it take to see results from Omega-3 supplementation?**
A:  The time it takes to see benefits varies depending on the reason for taking them and individual factors. It may take several weeks or months for noticeable effects.  Regular blood tests can help monitor progress.

**Q:  What's the difference between EPA and DHA?**
A: EPA and DHA are both omega-3 fatty acids with various health benefits.  EPA is more associated with reducing inflammation, while DHA is crucial for brain and eye health.  Many supplements contain both.
