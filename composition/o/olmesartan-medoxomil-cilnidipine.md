# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine

**Generic Name:** Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  Olmesartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and cilnidipine is a calcium channel blocker (dihydropyridine type).  By working together, they lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  It's typically prescribed for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication.  The specific dosage and frequency will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects may include:

* **Headache:** This is a frequent side effect, often mild and temporary.
* **Dizziness:**  May be related to blood pressure changes.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Flushing:** Feeling warm or red in the face.
* **Edema (swelling):** Particularly in the ankles and feet.
* **Cough:** Less common than with ACE inhibitors, but still possible.


Serious, but less common, side effects include:

* **Angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):**  Can cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Liver problems:**  Monitor for signs like jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
* **Kidney problems:**  Regular monitoring of kidney function may be necessary.


**This is not an exhaustive list.**  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil:**  Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking this action, blood vessels relax and widen, lowering blood pressure.
* **Cilnidipine:**  Relaxes blood vessels by blocking the entry of calcium into the muscle cells of blood vessel walls. This relaxation leads to wider blood vessels and lower blood pressure.

Together, these two drugs provide a synergistic effect, leading to a greater reduction in blood pressure than either drug alone.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  It's generally advised to limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication, as alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor for specific guidance.

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins. Some interactions are possible.

* **What if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **How long will it take to see results?**  It may take several weeks to see the full effects of this medication.  Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential.

* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?**  No, stopping this medication suddenly can be harmful.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually reducing the dose if you need to discontinue treatment.
