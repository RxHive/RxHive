# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine
### Generic Name
Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine

### Usage
Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine is a combination medication used primarily to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It combines two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan medoxomil, and a calcium channel blocker, cilnidipine.  By working through different mechanisms, this combination often provides more effective blood pressure control than either drug alone.  While its primary use is in hypertension management, this combination may be considered for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with a single medication.  It's crucial to understand that this medication treats the symptoms of hypertension, not the underlying cause.  A doctor will determine the appropriate use based on individual health needs and medical history.


### Dosage
Dosage of Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine is determined by a physician and varies depending on individual patient needs and response.  There is no standard dosage for children, as this medication is typically prescribed for adults.  The specific formulation (tablet strength) and frequency will be tailored to each patient.  Generally, treatment begins with a low dose, which may be gradually increased if blood pressure remains uncontrolled.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and not to adjust the medication without consulting a doctor.  

* **Oral Administration:**  This combination is usually administered orally once daily, typically in the morning. Tablets should be swallowed whole with water.
* **IV Administration:** This combination is *not* available in an intravenous (IV) formulation.

**Important Note:**  The information above is a general overview.  Always follow the dosage instructions provided by your physician.  Never alter the dosage without consulting your doctor.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Swelling in ankles or feet
* Dry cough (less common than with ACE inhibitors)
* Flushing

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) – requires immediate medical attention.
* Hypotension (low blood pressure) – can cause dizziness or fainting.
* Liver problems – signs may include jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) or dark urine.

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
This medication works through a dual mechanism of action:

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil (ARB):**  Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, olmesartan helps relax and widen blood vessels, reducing blood pressure.
* **Cilnidipine (Calcium Channel Blocker):**  Relaxes blood vessel walls by blocking the entry of calcium into muscle cells. This relaxation leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), thus lowering blood pressure.

The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more comprehensive approach to lowering blood pressure than either drug alone.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema related to ACE inhibitors or other ARBs.  It should also be avoided in patients with severe liver or kidney disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine can interact with other medications, including diuretics, potassium supplements, and other blood pressure medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of this medication.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Kidney and Liver Impairment:** This medication requires dosage adjustment in patients with kidney or liver problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication abruptly?**  A: No, stopping this medication suddenly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects. Moderate alcohol intake should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?**  A: Store this medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of the reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q:  Can I take this medication with other blood pressure medications?** A: Only take this medication as prescribed by your doctor.  Taking multiple blood pressure medications simultaneously may require close monitoring by your physician.  Never adjust your medications without consulting your healthcare provider.
