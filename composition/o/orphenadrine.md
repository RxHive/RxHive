# Orphenadrine
### Generic Name
Orphenadrine

### Usage

Orphenadrine is primarily used as an adjunct therapy to manage discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.  This means it works best when combined with other treatments like rest, physical therapy, and other pain-relieving measures. It's not a standalone treatment for muscle pain or spasms.  It's also used in the treatment of Parkinsonism, helping to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with this neurological disorder.  The precise role and effectiveness of orphenadrine in Parkinson's disease is a subject of ongoing discussion within the medical community.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and the form of the medication (citrate or hydrochloride).

* **Muscle Spasm/Musculoskeletal Discomfort:**
    * **Oral (Citrate):**  100 mg twice daily (BID).
    * **Intravenous/Intramuscular (Citrate):** 60 mg every 12 hours.  A switch to oral medication should be made as soon as clinically feasible.

* **Parkinsonism:**
    * **Oral (Hydrochloride):**  The starting dose is typically 150 mg per day, divided into multiple doses. This dose may be increased by 50 mg every 2-3 days, up to a maximum of 400 mg per day, divided into multiple doses, until optimal benefit is reached.  Close monitoring is needed to avoid adverse effects.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of orphenadrine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not specify dose adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using orphenadrine if you have liver or kidney problems.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Agitation
* Confusion
* Hallucinations
* Increased intraocular pressure (potentially dangerous for glaucoma patients)
* Urinary retention
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, especially with the injectable form)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Orphenadrine has two main mechanisms of action:

1. **Anticholinergic effects:** It blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle control and other bodily functions. This helps to reduce muscle spasms and tremors, particularly beneficial in Parkinsonism.

2. **Skeletal muscle relaxant effects:** The exact mechanism of its muscle relaxant properties isn't fully understood, but it is thought to reduce muscle spasms by affecting the central nervous system.


Essentially, orphenadrine helps to calm overactive nerves and muscles, thereby relieving pain and discomfort associated with musculoskeletal conditions and certain aspects of Parkinsonism.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Orphenadrine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, glaucoma, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, stenosing peptic ulcers, prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, cardiospasm, myasthenia gravis, and tardive dyskinesia.

* **Drug Interactions:** Orphenadrine can interact with various medications, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, CNS depressants, pramlintide, diphenhydramine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and phenothiazines. Concomitant use should be avoided or carefully monitored.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with heart conditions, a history of drug abuse or alcoholism.  Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking orphenadrine.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Orphenadrine is classified as Category C in pregnancy. It's excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication.


* **Elderly Patients:**  Due to increased risk of anticholinergic side effects, Orphenadrine may not be the best choice for the elderly unless carefully monitored by a medical professional.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive while taking Orphenadrine?** A:  Drowsiness is a common side effect.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Q: How should I store Orphenadrine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Orphenadrine suddenly?** A: No, it's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions for stopping the medication.  Sudden cessation might lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double the dose.
