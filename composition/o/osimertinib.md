# Osimertinib

**Generic Name:** Osimertinib

**Usage:** Osimertinib is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have a specific EGFR mutation.  Specifically, it's used in patients with:

* **Metastatic NSCLC:**  Whose disease has spread to other parts of the body and has a specific EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) mutation.  It's also used in those with T790M mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC (after progression on prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors).
* **Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC:** With EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) mutations, as an initial treatment (first-line therapy).
* **Early-stage NSCLC:** (Adjuvant setting) after complete tumor resection (surgery) in patients with specific EGFR mutations.


**Side Effects:** Like all medications, osimertinib can cause side effects. Some common side effects include:

* **Diarrhea:** Often a significant side effect, sometimes requiring medication adjustments or discontinuation.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Vomiting:** Throwing up.
* **Rash:** Skin irritation or eruptions.
* **Dry skin:**  Dehydration of the skin.
* **Nail changes:** Thickening, discoloration, or fragility of nails.
* **Pneumonitis (lung inflammation):** A serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Increased liver enzymes:**  Indicated through blood tests.  Can show liver damage.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or weak.
* **Eye problems:** such as blurry vision or dry eyes.

**Serious side effects** are less common but can include heart problems, severe skin reactions, and other organ-related issues.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.  The severity and frequency of side effects can vary from person to person.

**How it Works:** Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  EGFR is a protein that helps cancer cells grow and divide.  Osimertinib specifically targets the EGFR protein in cancer cells with certain mutations (like exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R mutations, and the T790M mutation). By blocking the EGFR, osimertinib inhibits the growth and spread of these cancer cells.  It also works against some EGFR mutations that are resistant to other EGFR TKIs.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: How is osimertinib administered?** A: Osimertinib is taken orally (as a tablet).
* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of osimertinib?** A: Long-term effects vary and are best discussed with your oncologist.  Some patients may experience prolonged side effects, while others may not. Regular monitoring is important.
* **Q:  How often will I need blood tests?** A: Your doctor will order blood tests regularly to monitor your liver function, blood counts, and other important markers to assess your response to the treatment and detect potential side effects.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions on what to do if you miss a dose.  Generally, it's not recommended to double up on doses.
* **Q:  Is osimertinib suitable for everyone with lung cancer?** A: No, osimertinib is only suitable for patients with specific EGFR mutations in their lung cancer.  Your doctor will determine if you are a suitable candidate through genetic testing.
* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, osimertinib can interact with other medications.  It's important to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
