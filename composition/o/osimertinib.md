# Osimertinib
### Generic Name
Osimertinib

### Usage
Osimertinib is a targeted therapy primarily used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Its use is specifically targeted to patients whose tumors have certain genetic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Primarily, Osimertinib is used in two key scenarios:

1. **First-line treatment:** For patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have either an EGFR exon 19 deletion or an exon 21 L858R mutation.  These mutations make the cancer cells particularly sensitive to Osimertinib.  Testing to confirm the presence of these mutations is crucial before starting treatment.

2. **Treatment of metastatic disease progressing after prior EGFR TKI therapy:**  For patients whose metastatic NSCLC has progressed despite prior treatment with other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), Osimertinib can be used if their tumor shows the EGFR T790M mutation. Again, confirmatory testing is essential.


### Dosage

The standard adult dose of Osimertinib is 80 mg once daily (OD) orally. This dose is continued until the disease progresses or unacceptable side effects occur, regardless of whether it's first-line treatment or treatment after progression on other EGFR TKIs.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dose adjustment is typically needed. For severe impairment, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dose adjustments; caution is advised and close monitoring is essential.

* **Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is generally recommended for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 15 and 89 mL/min.  Guidance for CrCl ≤ 15 mL/min or end-stage renal disease isn't provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reduction to 40mg once daily or treatment interruption may be necessary depending on the type and severity of side effects.  In some cases, permanent discontinuation may be required.  Close monitoring by a healthcare provider is crucial.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Osimertinib in children haven't been established.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include: nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis (mouth sores), decreased appetite, constipation, visual disturbances (such as blurred vision or dry eyes), fatigue, rash, itching, nail problems, headache, back pain, cough, and various blood count changes (neutropenia, lymphopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia).

Less common but potentially serious side effects include: stroke, interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, QT interval prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality), pneumonia, blood clots (pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolism), decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF – a measure of heart function), and cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease).

Always inform your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.

### How it Works

Osimertinib is a type of targeted therapy called an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  EGFR is a protein that plays a role in the growth and spread of some cancer cells.  Certain mutations in the EGFR gene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Osimertinib selectively targets and blocks the activity of these mutated EGFR proteins, thereby hindering the growth and spread of cancer cells.  It has greater selectivity for mutated EGFR compared to the normal, wild-type EGFR.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Osimertinib is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:** Osimertinib's metabolism can be affected by other drugs.  Strong CYP3A inhibitors can increase Osimertinib levels, potentially leading to increased side effects, while strong CYP3A inducers can decrease Osimertinib levels, potentially reducing effectiveness.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Osimertinib is expected to cause fetal harm.  Effective contraception is essential during treatment and for a period after treatment. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for two weeks after the final dose.


* **Warnings:**  Osimertinib can increase the risk of various serious side effects such as bone marrow suppression, cardiovascular toxicity,  cutaneous toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, ocular toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity. Regular monitoring is crucial.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Osimertinib with food?** A: Osimertinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not try to make up for a missed dose.  Simply take the next dose as scheduled.

* **Q: How is Osimertinib stored?** A:  Store Osimertinib according to the instructions provided on the label.

* **Q:  Who should not take Osimertinib?** A: People with a known allergy to Osimertinib or its components should not take it.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects from taking Osimertinib?** A:  Long-term effects are possible; regular monitoring by your healthcare provider is essential to detect and manage any issues.
