# Oxymetazoline (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Oxymetazoline (Nasal)

### Usage
Oxymetazoline nasal spray or drops are used for the temporary relief of nasal congestion and sinus congestion or pressure.  This relief is primarily for symptoms caused by the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), or other upper respiratory allergies.  It's important to remember that oxymetazoline only treats symptoms and doesn't address the underlying cause of the congestion.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Nasal Congestion):**

* **Spray Solution (0.05% or 0.5%):** The dosage varies depending on the concentration.  Always follow the instructions on your specific product label.  Generally, it's 1-3 sprays into each nostril, but the frequency and maximum daily dose will differ.  Higher concentration solutions (0.5%) often have lower recommended frequency.  Do not exceed the recommended dose, and usage should not extend beyond 3 days.
* **Drops (0.05% or 0.5%):**  Similar to sprays, the dosage depends on the concentration. Typically, it's 1-2 drops into each nostril, with the frequency determined by the concentration and product label instructions.  Again, do not exceed 3 days of use.


**Pediatric Dosage (Nasal Congestion):**  Dosage for children is significantly lower than for adults and is strictly dependent on age and concentration.  **Always consult a pediatrician or pharmacist before giving oxymetazoline to a child.**  The information below is for general awareness and should not be interpreted as a prescription:

* **Infants (<5 weeks):**  Very low concentration solutions (0.01%) might be used, with 1 drop in each nostril 2-3 times daily, but for a maximum of 3 days.
* **Infants (5 weeks to <1 year):**  Similar to above, a very low concentration solution is used (0.01%).
* **Children (1 to <6 years):**  Low concentration solutions (0.025%) might be prescribed.
* **Children (â‰¥6 years):**  Lower concentrations (0.05%) are generally used.

**Important Note:**  The specific concentration and dosage for children must be determined by a healthcare professional.  Never use adult-strength oxymetazoline on a child.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Dry nose, burning or stinging sensation in the nose, sneezing.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Rebound congestion (worsening congestion after stopping the medication), headache, insomnia.  Allergic reactions such as rash, itching, or swelling are also possible, though rare.
* **If you experience any side effects, particularly unusual or persistent ones, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.**

### How it Works
Oxymetazoline is a type of medication called an alpha-adrenergic agonist. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages. This vasoconstriction reduces swelling and inflammation, leading to decreased congestion and improved airflow.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Oxymetazoline is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components, those with angle-closure glaucoma, and those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
* **Interactions:**  Oxymetazoline can interact with several other medications, including MAOIs, certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants), and some antihypertensive drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of oxymetazoline during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a healthcare provider as it is considered a Category C drug for pregnancy.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Children and older adults require lower dosages; always consult with a healthcare professional before administering to these groups.
* **Long-Term Use:**  Prolonged use of oxymetazoline can lead to rebound congestion.  It's crucial to use it only as directed and for a limited time (generally no more than 3 days).


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take oxymetazoline to work?**  A:  The decongestant effect usually starts within a few minutes of administration.
* **Q: Can I use oxymetazoline for more than 3 days?** A: No. Prolonged use can cause rebound congestion, making your nasal congestion worse.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one. Simply continue with your regular schedule.
* **Q: Can I use oxymetazoline with other nasal sprays?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining oxymetazoline with other nasal medications.
* **Q: How should I store oxymetazoline?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and excessive heat.
