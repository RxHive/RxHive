# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Chlorthalidone

**Generic Name:** Olmesartan Medoxomil/Chlorthalidone

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  Olmesartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and chlorthalidone is a diuretic (water pill).  By working together, they lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is often experienced early in treatment and usually subsides.
* **Lightheadedness:**  Similar to dizziness, often related to blood pressure changes.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or lacking energy.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect of many medications.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Muscle cramps:**  Especially in the legs and feet.
* **Diarrhea or constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Dry cough:** A less frequent but possible side effect.
* **Increased potassium levels (hyperkalemia):**  More common in patients with kidney problems.
* **Dehydration:**  Due to the diuretic effect of chlorthalidone.

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention.  These include:**

* **Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema):**  A life-threatening allergic reaction.
* **Signs of kidney problems:**  Decreased urine output, swelling, fatigue.
* **Signs of liver problems:** Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):**  Symptoms may include muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat.


**How it Works:**

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil:**  This ARB blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, olmesartan allows blood vessels to relax and widen, thus lowering blood pressure.
* **Chlorthalidone:** This diuretic increases the amount of salt and water excreted by the kidneys.  This reduces the volume of blood circulating in the body, thereby lowering blood pressure.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of dizziness and lightheadedness. Limit or avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I take this medication with other drugs?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Some drugs can interact with olmesartan medoxomil/chlorthalidone.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects may subside.  Contact your doctor if side effects are severe, persistent, or bothersome.  Seek immediate medical attention for serious side effects like angioedema.

* **Q:  How long will it take to see results?** A: It may take several weeks before you experience the full blood pressure-lowering effect of this medication.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking this medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.
