# Ofloxacin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + Sodium Phosphate + Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate

It's crucial to understand that providing detailed information about a medication, especially one containing a potentially hazardous ingredient like Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate, requires the expertise of a medical professional.  The following information is for general knowledge only and **should not be considered medical advice**.  **Do not use this information to self-treat.**  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before using any medication.  Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate, in particular, is rarely used now due to its toxicity.

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + Sodium Phosphate + Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate (This combination is unlikely to be found in modern formulations due to the toxicity concerns of Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate.)

**Usage:**  Historically, a combination like this *might* have been used as an ophthalmic (eye) solution to treat bacterial infections.  The individual components would have the following roles:

* **Ofloxacin:** A fluoroquinolone antibiotic that kills bacteria.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** A viscosity-increasing agent, making the solution easier to apply and stay in the eye.
* **Sodium Phosphate:** A buffering agent, helping to maintain the solution's pH.
* **Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate:** A preservative, now largely avoided due to its toxicity and potential for serious side effects.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects would be primarily associated with Ofloxacin and the potentially serious systemic effects of Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate absorption.  These could include:

* **Ofloxacin related:**  Burning or stinging upon application, eye redness, blurred vision, irritation.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions.
* **Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate related:** This preservative is highly toxic and can cause serious systemic effects including kidney damage, neurological problems, and potentially death through absorption.  Even topical exposure can be problematic.

**How it Works:** Ofloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and cell division, leading to bacterial cell death. The other ingredients are excipients that aid in the delivery and stability of the medication.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this medication still commonly used?** A: No. Due to the toxicity concerns of Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate, this specific combination is extremely unlikely to be found in modern formulations.  Modern ophthalmic solutions use safer preservatives.
* **Q: What are the alternatives?** A: Many safer and equally effective ophthalmic antibiotics are available.  Your doctor can recommend an appropriate alternative.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication immediately and consult a doctor or pharmacist.
* **Q: Can I use this medication without a prescription?** A: No.  This medication should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
