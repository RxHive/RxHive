# Oritavancin
### Generic Name
Oritavancin

### Usage
Oritavancin is a powerful antibiotic used to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in adults.  These infections can range from simple cellulitis (infection of the deeper skin layers) to more serious conditions like abscesses (pus-filled pockets) and infections involving deeper tissues.  It's specifically effective against gram-positive bacteria, a common cause of these types of infections.  Currently, there are no approved uses in children.

### Dosage
The standard adult dose for ABSSSI is a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 1200 mg administered over three hours.  There are no established pediatric dosages, and the safety and efficacy in children haven't been determined.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly defined for severe cases,  requiring caution and close monitoring by a healthcare professional.  For mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment, adjustments aren't typically necessary.  Oritavancin isn't removed by hemodialysis.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in extremities)
* Skin rash, itching (pruritus), urticaria (hives)
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Anemia
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, bilirubin)
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include:

* Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxisâ€”a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection (a serious intestinal infection)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Erythema multiforme (a skin reaction)
* Osteomyelitis (bone infection)


If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Oritavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic. It works by targeting the cell walls of bacteria, interfering with their construction and ultimately causing them to die.  Specifically, it inhibits two crucial steps in cell wall synthesis: transglycosylation (polymerization) and transpeptidation (cross-linking).  Additionally, it disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death. This mechanism makes it particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Oritavancin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to oritavancin or any of its components.  Patients with a history of glycopeptide allergies should be carefully monitored.
* **Unfractionated Heparin:** Use of intravenous unfractionated heparin is contraindicated for 5 days after oritavancin administration.
* **Drug Interactions:** Oritavancin can interact with anticoagulants (blood thinners) like warfarin, potentially increasing their effects and requiring close monitoring of anticoagulation levels. It may also interact with other antibiotics and some vaccines, so inform your doctor of all medications and vaccines you are taking or plan to take.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Oritavancin is classified as pregnancy category C, meaning the risk to the fetus is not fully understood. It's also unknown if it's excreted in breast milk.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with your doctor.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:**  Patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment should be closely monitored, as dosage adjustments aren't always clearly defined for these populations.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Oritavancin?** A: Improvement in symptoms should be seen within a few days, but the complete course of treatment should be followed as directed by your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take Oritavancin with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Do not start or stop any medications without consulting your doctor.

* **Q: How should I store Oritavancin?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.  Generally, medications should be kept at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Oritavancin is usually given as a single dose.  If you have concerns about your treatment plan, contact your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Q: Is Oritavancin safe for long-term use?** A:  Oritavancin is typically used for a single dose to treat ABSSSI.  Long-term use is not generally recommended.
