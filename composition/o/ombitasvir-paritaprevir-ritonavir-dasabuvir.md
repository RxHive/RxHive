# Ombitasvir + Paritaprevir + Ritonavir + Dasabuvir
### Generic Name
Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Dasabuvir

### Usage

Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Dasabuvir is a combination medication used to treat chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.  Specifically, it's indicated for adults with genotypes 1a and 1b of the virus.  The drug combination is often used in conjunction with ribavirin, depending on the patient's specific circumstances, such as the presence or absence of cirrhosis.  This combination therapy targets different stages of the HCV lifecycle, increasing its effectiveness.


### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the HCV genotype (1a or 1b), the presence or absence of cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and the specific formulation used (immediate-release or extended-release).  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage instructions precisely.

**Adults:**  The medication is available in both immediate-release and extended-release forms.

* **Genotype 1a (with or without compensated cirrhosis):**  The regimen typically involves a combination of immediate-release tablets (Ombitasvir 12.5 mg/Paritaprevir 75 mg/Ritonavir 50 mg) and Dasabuvir 250 mg tablets, taken for 12 to 24 weeks (longer duration if cirrhosis is present).  An extended-release formulation is also available.

* **Genotype 1b (with or without compensated cirrhosis):**  Treatment generally lasts 12 weeks and utilizes a similar approach to genotype 1a with a combination of immediate-release and/or extended-release tablets.

* **Specific tablet counts and frequencies:** Consult the prescribing information or your physician for exact instructions, as there are variations based on the formulation. For example, an immediate-release regimen might involve two tablets of the triple combination daily, plus one Dasabuvir tablet twice daily.  The extended-release version will have different tablet counts and frequencies.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Dasabuvir in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with specific conditions like hepatic or renal impairment.  Severe liver impairment is typically a contraindication to using this medication. Consult your healthcare professional regarding any necessary adjustments.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Insomnia
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash
* Nausea
* Asthenia (weakness or fatigue)
* Increased levels of bilirubin and ALT (liver enzymes) in blood tests

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema (swelling)
* Erythema multiforme (skin rash)
* Liver failure
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Liver decompensation
* Reactivation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly the serious ones listed above, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir, and Dasabuvir are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that target different parts of the HCV replication cycle.  Ombitasvir blocks the NS5A protein, preventing viral replication and assembly. Paritaprevir inhibits the NS3/4A protease, an enzyme essential for viral replication. Dasabuvir inhibits the NS5B polymerase, which is responsible for the synthesis of new HCV RNA.  Ritonavir is a boosting agent; it doesn't have direct antiviral activity against HCV but significantly increases the blood levels of Paritaprevir, enhancing its effectiveness.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to any component of the drug, moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C), or those concurrently taking certain medications (see below).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir/Dasabuvir interacts with many drugs metabolized through the liver.  Concomitant use of several drugs is contraindicated due to significantly increased risk of adverse effects.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal supplements) you're currently taking.

* **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation:** Patients should be tested for HBV prior to starting treatment. Reactivation of HBV can occur, potentially leading to serious liver complications. Careful monitoring is necessary.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy.  The decision to breastfeed while on this medication should be made in consultation with your doctor, considering both the benefits of breastfeeding and the potential risks to the infant.


* **Vulnerable Populations:** Specific precautions apply to patients with renal impairment, diabetes, or those taking other medications such as anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin).

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: It's generally advisable to avoid alcohol while taking this medication as it can interfere with the liver's ability to process the medication and may also interact negatively with the liver itself. 

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Don't try to catch up by taking two doses at once.

* **Q: How long will I need to take this medication?** A: Treatment duration varies from 12 to 24 weeks, depending on factors like genotype and the presence of cirrhosis, as well as clinical response to the treatment.


* **Q: Will this medication cure my HCV?** A: With proper adherence and monitoring by your doctor, this medication offers a high likelihood of achieving a sustained virological response (SVR), which essentially means the virus is undetectable after treatment completion. However, itâ€™s important to follow all instructions from your doctor.
