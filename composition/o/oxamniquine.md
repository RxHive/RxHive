# Oxamniquine
### Generic Name
Oxamniquine

### Usage
Oxamniquine is an anthelmintic medication, specifically a schistosomicidal drug.  Its primary use is to treat infections caused by *Schistosoma mansoni*, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis (bilharzia).  It's important to note that oxamniquine is *not* effective against other species of *Schistosoma*, such as *S. haematobium* or *S. japonicum*.  Due to the emergence of oxamniquine resistance in some *S. mansoni* strains, praziquantel is now the preferred treatment for schistosomiasis.  Oxamniquine's use is largely limited to situations where praziquantel is unavailable or contraindicated, and its efficacy should be carefully considered.

### Dosage
Dosage of oxamniquine varies depending on the patient's weight and age.  It is typically administered orally.  Precise dosing instructions should always be obtained from a healthcare professional.  Generally, for adults, the recommended dose is 15 mg/kg of body weight, given as a single dose.  For children, the same dosage may be used, but a doctor should determine the appropriate amount based on the child's weight and overall health.  The medication is usually taken with food to minimize potential gastrointestinal side effects. Different formulations may exist (though less common now), so follow the instructions provided with the specific medication you are using.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of oxamniquine can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Drowsiness

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Seizures
* Changes in vision
* Severe abdominal pain

If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to seek medical advice immediately.

### How it Works
Oxamniquine works by paralyzing the *Schistosoma mansoni* worms.  It affects the worm's musculature, causing contractions and immobilization of their suckers. This prevents the worms from attaching to the blood vessel walls. The detached worms are then carried by the bloodstream to the liver where they are destroyed by the body's immune system through processes like phagocytosis (engulfment by immune cells).

### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with a known allergy to oxamniquine or any of its components should not use this medication.
* **Liver Disease:** Oxamniquine should be used with caution in patients with liver disease, as it is metabolized by the liver.  A doctor should carefully assess the risks and benefits.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of oxamniquine during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Consult a healthcare professional before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:** While limited information is available on specific drug interactions, it is always advisable to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Oxamniquine can cause dizziness and drowsiness.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
