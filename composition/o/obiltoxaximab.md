# Obiltoxaximab
### Generic Name
Obiltoxaximab

### Usage
Obiltoxaximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat inhalational anthrax caused by *Bacillus anthracis*. It's crucial to understand that obiltoxaximab doesn't directly kill the bacteria; it works by neutralizing the anthrax toxin. Therefore, it's always used in combination with appropriate antibacterial medications to combat the infection itself.  In situations where alternative treatments aren't suitable or available, obiltoxaximab may also be used to prevent inhalational anthrax (prophylaxis).  However, the decision to use it for prophylaxis should carefully weigh the potential benefits against the risk of hypersensitivity reactions.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Before administering obiltoxaximab, premedication with diphenhydramine is recommended to help mitigate potential allergic reactions.

**Anthrax (Treatment and Prophylaxis):**  Obiltoxaximab is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage varies based on weight:

* **Adults and Children weighing ≥40 kg:** 16 mg/kg as a single dose.
* **Children weighing 15 kg to <40 kg:** 24 mg/kg as a single dose.
* **Children weighing ≤15 kg:** 32 mg/kg as a single dose.

The IV infusion should be given over 90 minutes in pediatric patients and over 1 hour and 30 minutes in adults using a 0.22-micron inline filter.  The line should be flushed with normal saline after the infusion.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Headache

**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Voice disorders
* Chest discomfort/pain
* Palpitations
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Hives (urticaria)
* Abnormal blood cell counts (lymphocytes, neutrophils, white blood cells)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Antibody development
* Infusion site reactions (bruising, discoloration)
* Limb pain
* Increased creatine phosphokinase levels
* Musculoskeletal pain/myalgia
* Cough
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Throat irritation
* Runny nose (rhinorrhea)
* Nasal congestion
* Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of skin)
* Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
* Oropharyngeal pain
* Sinus congestion
* Fever
* Infusion-related reactions


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:** Anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) has been reported.

**Important:** If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Obiltoxaximab is a targeted therapy. It's a monoclonal antibody designed to bind specifically to the protective antigen (PA) of the *B. anthracis* toxin.  The PA is a crucial component of the anthrax toxin; by binding to it, obiltoxaximab prevents the PA from interacting with other parts of the toxin (lethal factor and edema factor).  This blockade stops the toxin from entering cells and causing the harmful effects characteristic of anthrax.  This neutralization of the toxin helps to reduce the severity of the disease, but it doesn't directly eliminate the bacteria.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity and Anaphylaxis:**  Obiltoxaximab carries a significant risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis.  It should be administered in a closely monitored setting by trained personnel equipped to manage anaphylaxis.  Patients should be observed carefully during and after infusion.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Obiltoxaximab is a Category B drug in pregnancy.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks.  The excretion of obiltoxaximab in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding mothers should be aware of this uncertainty.
* **Other Medications:**  While specific drug interactions aren't extensively detailed, always inform your healthcare provider of all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) you are taking to avoid potential interactions.
* **Pediatric Use:** Dosage adjustments are made for pediatric patients based on weight.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for obiltoxaximab to work?** A:  The effects of obiltoxaximab are not immediate.  It works by neutralizing the toxin, contributing to overall anthrax treatment in conjunction with antibiotics. The timeline for improvement will depend on the severity of the infection and the response to the combined therapy.

* **Q: How is obiltoxaximab stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions. Generally, medications should be stored as directed to maintain efficacy.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Obiltoxaximab is typically a single-dose treatment.  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you have questions regarding your treatment plan.

* **Q:  Is obiltoxaximab a cure for anthrax?** A: No, obiltoxaximab is not a standalone cure.  It works in conjunction with antibiotics to treat the infection.  The antibiotics directly target and kill the bacteria, while obiltoxaximab neutralizes the toxin.  Both are crucial for successful treatment.

* **Q: Can I take other medications while receiving obiltoxaximab?** A: It's essential to disclose all medications to your healthcare provider.  Potential interactions with other drugs may need to be considered.
