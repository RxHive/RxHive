# Olopatadine (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Olopatadine (Systemic)

### Usage
Olopatadine (systemic) is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and various dermatologic allergy-related disorders and reactions. These include urticaria (hives), eczema, dermatitis (including atopic dermatitis), pruritus (itching), and other itchy skin conditions.  It effectively targets the underlying allergic response responsible for these symptoms.

**Adults (Allergic Rhinitis & Dermatologic Allergies):** The typical oral dose is 5 mg twice daily (BID).

**Children (Allergic Rhinitis & Dermatologic Allergies):**  For children aged 10 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults (5 mg BID).  Olopatadine is generally not recommended for children under 10 years of age unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, caution is advised when using olopatadine in these patient populations, and close monitoring by a healthcare professional is recommended.

### How it Works

Olopatadine is a histamine H1 receptor antagonist. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions, causing many of the associated symptoms.  Olopatadine works by blocking histamine from binding to its receptors on cells. This prevents the cascade of events that lead to symptoms like itching, sneezing, and inflammation.  It also inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells, further reducing allergic responses.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Use during pregnancy should be avoided.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, its use during breastfeeding should also be avoided.

* **Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  Close monitoring is essential.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Olopatadine can cause drowsiness or dizziness; avoid tasks requiring alertness until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Other Medications:** Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as some medications may interact with olopatadine.  Specific interactions are noted in the provided data.

* **Hypersensitivity:** Do not use if you are allergic to olopatadine or any of its ingredients (including Sunset Yellow 5 dye).
