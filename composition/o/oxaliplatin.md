# Oxaliplatin
### Generic Name
Oxaliplatin

### Usage
Oxaliplatin is a chemotherapy medication primarily used in the treatment of colorectal cancer.  Its main application is in treating advanced colorectal cancer, often in combination with other drugs like fluorouracil and leucovorin (often referred to as FOLFOX regimens).  It's also used adjuvantly (following surgery) for stage III colon cancer to help prevent recurrence.  Importantly, oxaliplatin is sometimes used off-label for other cancers, such as those of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, ovary, and in certain types of lymphoma and testicular cancer.  These off-label uses usually involve combining oxaliplatin with other chemotherapeutic agents.  The specific regimen and combination depend heavily on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as the patient's overall health.  Always consult with an oncologist for appropriate usage.

### Dosage
Oxaliplatin dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the specific cancer being treated, the patient's body surface area (BSA), and their kidney function.  It's always administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.  There is no established safe and effective pediatric dosage.

**Typical Adult Dosages (vary greatly depending on the treatment regimen):**

* **Advanced Colorectal Cancer:**  Common regimens involve 85 mg/m² every 2 weeks or 130 mg/m² every 3 weeks, usually combined with other drugs.
* **Adjuvant Stage III Colon Cancer:**  Typically 85 mg/m² every 2 weeks for up to 12 cycles, often combined with fluorouracil and leucovorin.
* **Other Cancers (off-label):**  Dosages vary widely depending on the specific regimen and cancer type, ranging from 85 mg/m² to 130 mg/m².  These regimens often include other chemotherapeutic agents.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosages may need to be adjusted based on kidney function (creatinine clearance) and the presence of other medical conditions.  Dose reductions are often necessary if side effects are severe.  Specific adjustments are determined by the treating physician based on the patient's response to treatment and any observed side effects.  Consult the prescribing information for complete details.

### Side Effects
Oxaliplatin can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.

* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)

* Mouth sores (mucositis)
* Headache


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Kidney damage
* Liver damage
* Heart rhythm problems
* Severe nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy)

**If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works
Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells.  It does this by forming cross-links within the DNA, preventing the cancer cells from replicating and ultimately leading to their death.  This effect is not limited to any specific phase of the cell cycle, making it effective against various cancer cells.

### Precautions
Several precautions are important to consider when using oxaliplatin:

* **Hypersensitivity:** Oxaliplatin can cause serious, life-threatening allergic reactions.  Patients with a history of allergy to oxaliplatin or other platinum-based drugs should not use it.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:** Oxaliplatin can affect kidney and liver function; careful monitoring is required, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney or liver problems.  Dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Oxaliplatin is harmful to a developing fetus and should not be used during pregnancy. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for several months afterward. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for at least 3 months after the final dose.
* **Peripheral Neuropathy:**  Oxaliplatin commonly causes peripheral neuropathy, which can be cumulative. The risk increases with cumulative dose and duration of treatment.  Close monitoring is essential.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Oxaliplatin may interact with other medications, particularly other nephrotoxic (kidney-damaging) drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Older Adults and Patients with other Medical Conditions:**  Older adults and patients with underlying medical conditions may be more susceptible to the side effects of oxaliplatin. Careful monitoring and dose adjustments might be necessary.
