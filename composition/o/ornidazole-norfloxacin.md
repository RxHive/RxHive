# Ornidazole + Norfloxacin

**Generic Name:** Ornidazole + Norfloxacin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat various bacterial infections, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract and urinary tract.  Specific infections treated may include bacterial diarrhea, typhoid fever (in some regions and formulations, often requiring additional antibiotics), and urinary tract infections (UTIs).  **However, it's crucial to note that this combination isn't a first-line treatment for most infections and its use should be guided by a physician's prescription.**  Self-medication is strongly discouraged. The specific infections treated will depend on the formulation and the physician's assessment.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage. Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.
* **Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, vertigo.
* **Skin:** Rash, itching.
* **Other:** Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis), changes in taste, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).

More serious, but less common, side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis):  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.
* Liver damage:  Symptoms may include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* Seizures:  Especially in individuals with pre-existing seizure disorders or those taking certain medications.


**How it Works:**

Ornidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic that works by damaging the DNA of susceptible anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.  This prevents them from multiplying and leads to their death.

Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting an enzyme (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) essential for bacterial DNA replication, repair, and transcription.  This action stops the bacteria from multiplying and leads to their death.

The combination provides broader coverage against a range of bacteria than either drug alone, targeting both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria.
