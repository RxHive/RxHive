# Omeprazole + Amoxicillin + Rifabutin
### Generic Name
Omeprazole + Amoxicillin + Rifabutin

### Usage
This triple-drug combination is specifically used to eradicate *Helicobacter pylori* infection in adults.  *H. pylori* is a bacterium that can infect the stomach lining and cause peptic ulcers, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining), and even increase the risk of stomach cancer. This combination therapy targets the bacteria using three different mechanisms to increase the likelihood of successful eradication.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage for *H. pylori* infection is four capsules every eight hours for fourteen days. Each capsule typically contains 10mg of omeprazole, 250mg of amoxicillin, and 12.5mg of rifabutin.  This equates to a total daily dose of 40mg omeprazole, 1000mg amoxicillin, and 50mg rifabutin.  If a dose is missed, simply continue with the next dose as scheduled; do not double up on doses.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of this combination in children under 18 have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** This combination is generally not recommended for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute).  Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance in such cases.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Headache/migraine
* Diarrhea
* Urine discoloration

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Skin rash (various types)
* Oropharyngeal pain (pain in the mouth and throat)
* Nausea, abdominal pain (upper and lower), dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Vomiting
* Vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection)
* Other genitourinary issues


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  This combination can, though rarely, cause more serious side effects, including liver problems, allergic reactions (such as anaphylaxis), blood disorders, and *Clostridioides difficile* infection (a severe type of diarrhea).  Many other potential side effects are associated with the individual drugs and are described in the full prescribing information.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse reaction.


### How it Works
This combination uses three different mechanisms to combat *H. pylori*:

* **Omeprazole (Proton Pump Inhibitor):** Reduces stomach acid production, creating a more favorable environment for the antibiotics to work and reducing the symptoms of gastritis or ulcers.
* **Amoxicillin (Antibiotic):**  A penicillin-class antibiotic that inhibits the growth and replication of *H. pylori* by disrupting its cell wall.
* **Rifabutin (Antibiotic):** A rifamycin antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, another crucial mechanism for bacterial growth and survival.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** This combination is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to any of its components (omeprazole, amoxicillin, rifabutin, or any excipients). It should also be avoided with certain other medications.


**Drug Interactions:** This medication interacts with a significant number of other drugs.  Examples include certain antiretrovirals, oral contraceptives, warfarin, methotrexate, and drugs metabolized by specific liver enzymes.  Inform your doctor about all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) you are currently taking.


**Warnings:**  This combination should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney problems, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those with a history of allergic reactions.  Patients should be aware of the potential for discoloration of bodily fluids (urine, feces, etc.) due to rifabutin.
