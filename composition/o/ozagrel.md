# Ozagrel
### Generic Name
Ozagrel

### Usage
Ozagrel, specifically Ozagrel sodium, is primarily used to improve cerebral vasospasm following surgery for subarachnoid hemorrhage and to alleviate the resulting ischemic symptoms.  It's also employed to improve motor dysfunction in the acute phase of cerebral artery thrombosis.  In essence, it helps treat complications stemming from disruptions in blood flow to the brain.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  The dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated.

* **Cerebral Vasospasm after Subarachnoid Hemorrhage:** 80 mg of Ozagrel sodium per day is administered intravenously (IV) as a continuous infusion over 24 hours.  Treatment typically begins soon after surgery and continues for two weeks. The dose may be adjusted based on the patient's age and symptom severity.

* **Motor Dysfunction from Cerebral Artery Thrombosis (Acute Phase):** 80 mg of Ozagrel sodium, diluted in a suitable solution, is given intravenously as a 2-hour infusion twice daily (BID) for approximately two weeks.  Again, dose adjustments may be necessary based on the patient's age and the severity of their symptoms.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Ozagrel in infants and children have not been established.

### Side Effects
The following are potential side effects of Ozagrel, although the frequency of occurrence is not specified in available information.

* Hemorrhage
* Shock or anaphylaxis
* Severe hepatic function disorder (marked increase in AST and/or ALT, or jaundice)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Leucopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Granulocytopenia (low granulocyte count)
* Acute renal failure

**Important Note:**  Any serious adverse reactions necessitate immediate medical attention.  Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Ozagrel sodium selectively inhibits the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a substance involved in blood clot formation and vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). By reducing TXA2 levels, Ozagrel helps to prevent platelet aggregation (clumping) and improve blood flow, particularly in the brain.  It also enhances the production of prostacyclin, another substance that counteracts the effects of TXA2. This combined action helps to relieve cerebral vasospasm and improve circulation.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ozagrel is contraindicated in patients with:

* A history of hypersensitivity to Ozagrel or its components
* Complications of hemorrhagic cerebral infarction, extradural hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, or primary intraventricular hemorrhage
* Cerebral embolism
* A high risk of cerebral embolism (e.g., atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, infective endocarditis) or major infarction with severe impairment of consciousness (relative contraindication)


**Increased Risk:**  Ozagrel may increase the risk of:

* Hemorrhage
* Shock
* Jaundice
* Leucopenia or granulocytopenia
* Acute renal failure


**Use with Caution:** Ozagrel should be used cautiously in patients with:

* A history of hemorrhage (digestive tract or subcutaneous)
* A history of cerebral hemorrhage, severe hypertension, severe diabetes mellitus, or thrombocytopenia
* Those already taking antiplatelet agents, thrombolytics, or anticoagulants

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Ozagrel during pregnancy and lactation has not been established.

### FAQs
