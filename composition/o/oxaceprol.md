# Oxaceprol
### Generic Name
Oxaceprol

### Usage

Oxaceprol is primarily used to manage the pain and inflammation associated with degenerative joint diseases.  This includes osteoarthritis affecting the knee, hip, spine, and smaller joints.  It's also used topically to treat superficial burns.  The oral form targets internal inflammation and pain, while the topical cream is applied directly to the skin's surface for localized treatment.

### Dosage

**Oral Administration (Degenerative Joint Disorders & Inflammatory Connective Tissue Diseases):**

* **Adults:** The typical dose is 200 mg three times daily (TID).  In severe cases, this may be increased to 400 mg TID initially, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Dosage reduction is generally recommended for elderly patients due to potential increased sensitivity.

* **Children:** The safety and efficacy of Oxaceprol in children have not been established. It should not be administered to children.

**Topical Administration (Superficial Burns):**

* **Adults & Children (Not recommended for children without medical supervision):** A 10% Oxaceprol cream is applied once daily (OD) to the affected areas.

* Skin rashes

Less common but serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after taking Oxaceprol, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

The precise mechanism of action for Oxaceprol isn't fully understood. However, it's known to reduce leukocyte extravasation (the leakage of white blood cells from blood vessels) and the adhesion of leukocytes to capillaries.  This helps to decrease inflammation.  Additionally, Oxaceprol stimulates the uptake of certain molecules crucial for cartilage regeneration, potentially contributing to its effectiveness in treating joint diseases.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Oxaceprol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Oxaceprol or its components.  For the topical formulation, it's contraindicated in the treatment of infected skin lesions.

* **Drug Interactions:** Oxaceprol can affect blood clotting in patients using vitamin K antagonists (anticoagulants).  It may also reduce the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications and interact with methotrexate and lithium.  Concurrent use with these medications is generally not recommended without specific medical supervision.

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in elderly patients and during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The safety of Oxaceprol during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established.

* **Other Precautions:**  Consult your doctor before starting Oxaceprol if you have any pre-existing health conditions, are taking other medications, or are considering pregnancy.
