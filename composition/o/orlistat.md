# Orlistat
### Generic Name
Orlistat

### Usage
Orlistat is primarily used for managing obesity in adults and children aged 12 years and older.  It's prescribed as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and exercise program.  The goal is to help individuals lose weight and maintain weight loss by reducing the absorption of dietary fat.  Orlistat is not a standalone solution for weight loss; lifestyle changes are crucial for success.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The typical dose is 120 mg three times daily (TID), taken with each main meal containing fat.  The dose should be taken during or up to one hour after a meal. If a meal is missed or contains no fat, the dose should be skipped.

**Children (≥12 years):** The dosage is the same as for adults – 120 mg three times daily with each main meal containing fat.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However, adjustments may not be necessary due to orlistat's low systemic absorption.  Specific adjustments might be necessary when taking orlistat concomitantly with certain medications:

* **Cyclosporine:** Administer cyclosporine at least 3 hours after taking orlistat.
* **Levothyroxine:**  Take levothyroxine and orlistat at least 4 hours apart and monitor thyroid function closely.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Oily rectal leakage
* Abdominal pain or discomfort
* Flatulence with discharge
* Bowel urgency
* Steatorrhea (oily stools)
* Fecal incontinence
* Frequent bowel movements
* Nausea


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Acute renal failure
* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Bronchospasm
* Liver problems (hepatitis, increased liver enzymes)
* Pancreatitis
* Increased risk of kidney stones
* Severe allergic reactions


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Orlistat works by inhibiting pancreatic and gastric lipases, enzymes responsible for breaking down fats in the digestive system. By blocking these enzymes, orlistat prevents the absorption of approximately 30% of dietary fat.  The unabsorbed fat is then eliminated from the body through the stool.  This reduction in fat absorption contributes to weight loss.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Orlistat is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to orlistat or any component of the formulation; those with chronic malabsorption syndrome; those with cholestasis; and pregnant women (Category X).
* **Interactions:** Orlistat can interact with several medications, including cyclosporine, levothyroxine, and fat-soluble vitamins.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Orlistat may increase the risk of kidney stones and liver problems.  Monitor for these issues, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions.  Use caution in patients with a history of hyperoxaluria or calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.  Patients should follow a balanced diet with limited fat intake for optimal results and to minimize side effects.  Breastfeeding mothers should exercise caution; the excretion of orlistat in breast milk is unknown.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use in pregnant and breastfeeding women is contraindicated.  Children under 12 years should not use this medication.  Elderly individuals should be monitored closely for adverse events.
