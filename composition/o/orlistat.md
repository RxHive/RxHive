# Orlistat

**Generic Name:** Orlistat

**Usage:**  Orlistat is used as part of a weight-loss program that includes a reduced-calorie diet and exercise. It's prescribed to obese or overweight adults (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) or overweight adults (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) with weight-related health problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or type 2 diabetes.  It works by preventing the absorption of some of the fat consumed in the diet.  It's important to note that it is not a magic bullet; lifestyle changes are crucial for effective weight loss.

**Side Effects:**  Orlistat's side effects are largely related to its mechanism of action – preventing fat absorption. The most common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:**  These are the most frequent and can be significant.  They include oily or fatty stools (steatorrhea), frequent bowel movements, gas with oily discharge, fecal incontinence, abdominal cramping, and urgent need to defecate.  These are often dose-dependent; reducing fat intake can mitigate these effects.
* **Less common side effects:**  Headache, dizziness, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, and back pain have also been reported.

**How it Works:** Orlistat works by inhibiting pancreatic lipases, enzymes responsible for breaking down fats in the digestive tract. By blocking these enzymes, a portion of ingested dietary fat is not digested and is excreted in the feces. This results in a reduction in caloric intake and contributes to weight loss.  The undigested fat can also cause the noted gastrointestinal side effects.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to see results?**  Weight loss varies significantly depending on individual factors and adherence to diet and exercise.  Results may be noticeable within a few weeks, but consistent use and lifestyle changes are key for sustained weight loss.
* **Can I take Orlistat with other medications?**  Orlistat can interfere with the absorption of some fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and medications. Discuss all your medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) with your doctor before starting Orlistat.
* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** Contact your doctor immediately if you experience severe or persistent gastrointestinal issues, or any other concerning side effects.
* **What kind of diet should I follow while taking Orlistat?**  A low-fat diet is crucial to minimize the risk and severity of gastrointestinal side effects. Your doctor or a registered dietitian can help you create a suitable meal plan.
* **Is Orlistat safe for everyone?**  Orlistat is not suitable for everyone.  It's contraindicated in certain conditions, such as chronic malabsorption syndrome, cholestasis, and hypersensitivity to orlistat.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should also be discussed with your doctor before starting the medication.
* **Can I stop taking Orlistat suddenly?**  It's best to discuss any changes to your medication regimen with your doctor before stopping Orlistat.
