# Ofloxacin (Otic)
### Generic Name
Ofloxacin (Otic)

### Usage
Ofloxacin otic solution is an antibiotic used to treat several ear infections.  Its primary use is in treating otitis externa (swimmer's ear), an infection of the outer ear canal.  It's also used to treat chronic suppurative otitis media (a middle ear infection with a perforated eardrum) and acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (a middle ear infection in patients with tubes already placed in the eardrum).  While not officially approved for this, it is sometimes used off-label to help close traumatic perforations of the eardrum.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Otitis externa:** 10 drops of 0.3% solution in the affected ear(s) once daily (OD) for 7 days.
* **Chronic suppurative otitis media (with perforated eardrum):** 10 drops of 0.3% solution in the affected ear(s) twice daily (BID) for 14 days.
* **Traumatic tympanic membrane perforation (off-label):** 2-3 drops of 0.3% solution once daily until the perforation is closed (as confirmed by a healthcare professional).

**Children:**

Dosage varies by age and condition:

* **Acute otitis externa (children ≥ 6 months):** 5 drops (0.25 mL) of 0.3% solution in the affected ear(s) once daily for 7 days.  Adolescents receive the adult dose.
* **Acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes:** 5 drops (0.25 mL) of 0.3% solution in the affected ear(s) twice daily for 10 days.
* **Chronic suppurative otitis media (with perforated eardrum, children ≥ 12 years):**  Same as adult dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, because systemic absorption is low, adjustments may not be necessary.  Always consult a doctor before adjusting dosage.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Local application site reactions (e.g., irritation)

**Less Common, but Possible Side Effects:**

* Nervous system: Dizziness, vertigo, paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Dermatologic: Skin rash, itching (pruritus)
* Gastrointestinal: Altered taste (dysgeusia)
* Other reported side effects (less than 1%, post-marketing, or from case reports): Auditory disturbances (temporary), diarrhea, fever, headache, hypertension, nausea, bleeding from the ear (otorrhagia), temporary psychiatric disturbances, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), tremor, vomiting, dry mouth (xerostomia).

**Serious Side Effects:**  Although rare, severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) are possible.  Consult a doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works

Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by interfering with an enzyme called DNA gyrase, which is essential for bacterial DNA replication. By inhibiting DNA gyrase, ofloxacin prevents bacteria from reproducing and ultimately kills them. This action targets the bacteria causing the ear infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ofloxacin otic solution is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to ofloxacin, other quinolones, or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), fungal or bacterial superinfections (new infections arising due to disruption of normal flora), and tendon inflammation or rupture.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ofloxacin otic solution is categorized as pregnancy category C.  The effect on a developing fetus is unknown.  Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  This medication is for ear use only. Do not inject, inhale, or use in the eyes.  If symptoms don't improve after a week, seek medical attention for further evaluation and possible culture testing to identify the infecting organism.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.
