# Oxantel
### Generic Name
Oxantel

### Usage
Oxantel is an anthelmintic medication, meaning it's used to treat parasitic worm infestations.  Its primary use is in combination with pyrantel pamoate to treat infections caused by several types of intestinal worms, including *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworm), *Trichuris orientalis* (another type of whipworm), pinworms ( *Enterobius vermicularis*), and hookworms (species of *Necator* and *Ancylostoma*).  Oxantel is not typically used as a monotherapy for these infections; its effectiveness is enhanced when used in conjunction with pyrantel.

### Dosage

Oxantel is usually administered orally, always in combination with pyrantel pamoate.  The dosage is typically calculated based on the patient's weight.

* **Adults and Children:** The standard dose is 10-20 mg/kg of oxantel, given as a single dose combined with pyrantel pamoate. The exact amount of pyrantel pamoate will depend on the specific product formulation and the patient's weight.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.

There are no specific dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic (liver) impairment mentioned in standard prescribing information. However, itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare provider before administering any medication to patients with compromised liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of oxantel, often mild and transient, can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramps
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
* Loss of appetite

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after taking oxantel, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Oxantel is a neuromuscular depolarizing agent.  It works by binding to and activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the muscles of parasitic worms. This activation causes the muscles to become overstimulated, leading to spastic paralysis and the expulsion of the worms from the body.  The combination with pyrantel pamoate enhances the anthelmintic effect, leading to more effective worm elimination.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Oxantel is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity or allergy to oxantel, pyrantel pamoate, or any components of the medication formulation.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** While specific dosage adjustments aren't typically recommended, caution is advised when using oxantel in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Close monitoring may be necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of oxantel during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established.  It's generally recommended to avoid using oxantel during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor for advice.
* **Pediatric Use:**  While oxantel is used in children, careful monitoring is necessary, especially in young children.  Always follow the prescribed dosage recommendations precisely.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for oxantel to work?** A: The effects of oxantel are usually seen within a few days to a week after administration.  However, complete elimination of worms may take longer.

* **Q:  Can I take oxantel with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Certain drug interactions are possible, although they are not frequently reported with oxantel.
