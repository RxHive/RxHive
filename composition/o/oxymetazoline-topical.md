# Oxymetazoline (Topical)
### Generic Name
Oxymetazoline (Topical)

### Usage
Oxymetazoline topical cream is primarily used to treat persistent facial redness (erythema) associated with rosacea in adults.  It's important to understand that it addresses the symptom (redness) and not the underlying cause of rosacea itself.  Currently, there are no approved uses for oxymetazoline topical in children or for conditions other than rosacea.

### Dosage
The recommended dosage for adults with rosacea is a pea-sized amount of 1% oxymetazoline cream applied once daily to the entire face.  This should be applied thinly and evenly, avoiding the eyes and lips. The pump dispenser should be primed before first use.  Always follow the instructions provided with your specific medication.  There is no established safe and effective dosage for children under 18 years of age.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% of users) include:

* Exacerbation of acne rosacea
* Application site dermatitis (skin inflammation)
* Application site erythema (redness)
* Application site pain

While less frequent, more serious side effects are possible.  Stop using the medication and consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
Oxymetazoline is a type of medicine called an alpha-1A adrenoceptor agonist. When applied topically, it works by narrowing the blood vessels in the face (vasoconstriction). This reduction in blood vessel size leads to a decrease in the visible redness associated with rosacea.

### Precautions
* **Cardiovascular Disease:** Use caution in patients with severe or unstable cardiovascular conditions like orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure when standing), uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), or uncontrolled hypotension (low blood pressure).
* **Glaucoma:** Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Other Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cerebral insufficiency, coronary insufficiency, Raynaud phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, or Sj√∂gren's syndrome.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The risk of major birth defects and miscarriage associated with oxymetazoline is unknown.  It's also unclear whether it's excreted in breast milk after topical application.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of oxymetazoline topical cream have not been established in children under 18.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with liver or kidney problems, according to current manufacturer labeling.  However, it's always best to discuss this with your doctor.
* **Avoid contact with eyes and lips.**  Wash hands immediately after application.  Do not apply to irritated skin or open wounds.
