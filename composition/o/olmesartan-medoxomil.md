# Olmesartan Medoxomil
### Generic Name
Olmesartan Medoxomil

### Usage
Olmesartan medoxomil is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent serious complications like stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease.  It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily.  It's an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), a class of medications that specifically block the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels.  While its primary use is for hypertension, Olmesartan medoxomil may also be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high blood pressure and other risk factors like diabetes or a history of heart attack.  The specific use and dosage will always be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and health conditions.

### Dosage

Dosage of Olmesartan medoxomil varies greatly depending on the individual's condition, age, and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the prescription provided by your doctor exactly.  Generally:

* **Oral Administration (Tablets):**  For hypertension, the usual starting dose for adults is 10-40mg once daily.  The dose can be adjusted depending on blood pressure response, up to a maximum of 80mg daily.  Children's dosages are not standardized and must be determined by a physician based on weight and condition.  Olmesartan medoxomil is not usually recommended for children unless specifically prescribed by a pediatric cardiologist.

* **IV Administration:**  Olmesartan medoxomil is not available in an intravenous (IV) formulation. It is administered orally only.

**Important Note:**  The information above is for general understanding only.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.  Never adjust your medication dosage without consulting your physician.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of Olmesartan medoxomil are usually mild and may include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea
* Upper respiratory infection
* Back pain

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, which can be life-threatening)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Kidney problems
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially angioedema, seek immediate medical attention.  Always report any concerning side effects to your healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Olmesartan medoxomil is an ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker).  Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict, leading to increased blood pressure.  Olmesartan medoxomil works by blocking the angiotensin II receptors in the body, preventing angiotensin II from binding and causing vasoconstriction. This results in relaxed blood vessels and lower blood pressure.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Olmesartan medoxomil should not be used during pregnancy, as it can cause harm to the developing fetus.  It is also contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to olmesartan medoxomil or any of its components.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Olmesartan medoxomil can interact with other medications, including potassium-sparing diuretics (water pills), potassium supplements, and some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Specific Populations:**  Elderly patients, those with kidney or liver problems, and those with a history of heart failure require careful monitoring while taking Olmesartan medoxomil.  Adjustments to the dosage may be necessary.

* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking this medication, as it can exacerbate its hypotensive effects (low blood pressure).


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Olmesartan medoxomil suddenly?**  A: No, stopping this medication abruptly can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure. Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: How should I store Olmesartan medoxomil?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.
