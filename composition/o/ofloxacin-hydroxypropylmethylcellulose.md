# Ofloxacin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (Ophthalmic Solution)

**Usage:** This combination is used topically in the eye to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and other bacterial infections of the eye.  Ofloxacin is the antibiotic that fights the bacteria, while hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acts as a lubricating agent, helping to soothe the irritated eye and improve comfort.  It's crucial to note that this is specifically an *ophthalmic* solution, meaning it's for eye use only and should not be ingested or used in any other way.

**Side Effects:**  Like other ophthalmic medications, Ofloxacin + Hydrohydroxypropyl methylcellulose can cause side effects, although they are usually mild.  These may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation upon application
* Itching
* Redness
* Eye irritation
* Blurred vision (temporary)
* Headache
* Dry eyes (paradoxically, despite the lubricating agent)

Rare, but more serious side effects are possible and warrant immediate medical attention. These can include:

* Severe eye pain
* Vision changes
* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)


**How it Works:**

* **Ofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting the enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) that bacterial cells need to replicate their DNA.  By blocking these enzymes, ofloxacin prevents the bacteria from multiplying and eventually kills them.

* **Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC):** This is a viscosity-increasing agent and lubricant. It helps to increase the viscosity of the eye drops, allowing them to stay in contact with the eye's surface longer, providing better drug delivery and soothing irritation.  It also acts as a tear substitute, helping to alleviate dryness.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?** Improvement in symptoms is usually seen within a few days, but it's important to complete the entire course of treatment, even if symptoms improve sooner, to prevent recurrence of the infection.

* **Can I wear contact lenses while using this medication?**  It's generally recommended to avoid wearing contact lenses while using this medication.  The medication may interact with the lenses and potentially impair their efficacy. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific advice.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Can I use this medication if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  It's crucial to consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant. The benefits should be weighed against potential risks to the baby.

* **What if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects usually resolve on their own.  If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.
