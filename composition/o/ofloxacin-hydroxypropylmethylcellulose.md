# Ofloxacin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
### Generic Name
Ofloxacin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye). Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against a broad range of bacteria commonly causing this infection. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acts as a lubricant and viscosity-increasing agent, helping to soothe the irritated eye and prolong the contact time of ofloxacin with the infected tissue, improving its effectiveness.  While primarily used for conjunctivitis, this combination might be considered in other superficial eye infections based on a doctor's assessment and bacterial sensitivity testing. It's crucial to understand that this is not a treatment for viral or fungal eye infections.


### Dosage

This medication is typically administered topically to the affected eye(s). The usual dosage is one or two drops in the affected eye(s) every 2 to 4 hours, as directed by a physician.  There isn't a standardized dosage for children, and prescription should always come with specific instructions based on the child's age and the severity of the condition.  For infants and young children, administration requires extra care to avoid accidental contact with the eyes and ensure the proper dosage.  The dosage should never be increased without consulting a doctor.  Oral or IV administration is not applicable for this combination medication, as it's formulated for topical ophthalmic use only.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Mild burning or stinging sensation upon application, temporary blurry vision, slight eye discomfort.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), eye pain, vision changes that persist, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia).  In rare cases, more systemic reactions associated with fluoroquinolones might occur.
* **Note:** If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.  Always inform your doctor about any allergies or sensitivities you may have.


### How it Works

Ofloxacin, the antibiotic component, works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This disruption prevents bacterial growth and ultimately kills the bacteria causing the infection. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, the lubricating agent, enhances the comfort level for the patient by providing lubrication and by allowing the ofloxacin to remain in contact with the eye longer, improving its therapeutic action.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you have a known allergy to ofloxacin or any other fluoroquinolone antibiotics or to any components of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While topical application minimizes systemic interaction, informing your doctor about other medications you are using, especially other eye drops, is crucial to avoid potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been extensively studied.  Consult your doctor before use if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in children and elderly individuals.  Always follow the prescribed dosage and carefully monitor for any side effects.  Contact lenses should generally be removed before application and reinserted after 15-20 minutes.
