# Ocrelizumab
### Generic Name
Ocrelizumab

### Usage

Ocrelizumab is a prescription medication used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS).  Specifically, it's approved for the treatment of adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS).  RMS is characterized by periods of disease relapse followed by remission, while PPMS shows a gradual worsening of symptoms without distinct relapses. Ocrelizumab helps to slow the progression of disability in both forms of the disease and reduce the frequency of relapses in RMS.


### Dosage

Ocrelizumab is administered intravenously (IV) by a healthcare professional.  The dosage regimen is as follows:

* **Initial Dose (RMS and PPMS):** 300 mg on Day 1, followed by another 300 mg two weeks later.
* **Subsequent Doses (RMS and PPMS):** A single 600 mg dose every six months.

**Important Premedication:** Before each infusion, patients are typically premedicated with methylprednisolone (100 mg IV) 30 minutes prior, and an antihistamine (like diphenhydramine) 30-60 minutes before, to help minimize infusion reactions. Acetaminophen may also be considered.  Infusion rates vary depending on the dose and any reactions experienced during previous infusions.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of ocrelizumab in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare provider will monitor the patient carefully in such cases and adjust treatment as necessary.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Decreased neutrophil count (a type of white blood cell)
* Decreased levels of serum immunoglobulins (proteins that help fight infection)
* Infections (in general)
* Skin infections
* Infusion-related reactions (such as fever, chills, nausea)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Depression
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Lower respiratory tract infections
* Diarrhea
* Herpes virus infections (including reactivation of latent infections)
* Back pain and limb pain
* Malignant neoplasms (cancers), including breast cancer
* Development of antibodies against ocrelizumab
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare and serious brain infection (see Precautions).
* Hepatitis B reactivation (see Precautions)


It is crucial to report any side effects, especially unusual or worsening symptoms, to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a protein found on the surface of certain immune B cells.  By binding to CD20, ocrelizumab depletes these B cells, which are believed to play a role in the inflammatory processes contributing to MS.  The reduction of these B cells helps to lessen the inflammation and damage to the nervous system associated with MS.  While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, the elimination of these B cells is thought to be the primary way it affects MS progression.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Ocrelizumab is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to ocrelizumab or its components.
* A history of a life-threatening infusion reaction to ocrelizumab.
* Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
* Severe, active infections.
* Existing or a history of confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
* Active malignancies.
* Severely immunocompromised states.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Increased Risk of Infection:** Ocrelizumab suppresses the immune system, increasing the risk of infections, including serious or opportunistic infections.  Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of infection.
* **Malignancy:** There's an increased risk of malignancy, including breast cancer, with ocrelizumab.
* **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):** PML is a rare but serious brain infection that can be fatal.  It's particularly important to monitor for signs of PML, especially in patients with risk factors.
* **Hepatitis B Reactivation:** Patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting ocrelizumab, as treatment can reactivate the virus.
* **Immunoglobulin Reduction:** Ocrelizumab can lower immunoglobulin levels, impacting the body's ability to fight infections.
* **Live Vaccines:**  Live vaccines should be avoided during treatment and for a period after discontinuation.  This is because the reduced immune response may cause a lack of immunity from the vaccines, or may cause a more severe reaction to the live vaccine.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for six months after the last dose. The effects of ocrelizumab on a developing fetus or breastfeeding infant are unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Ocrelizumab?**  A: The effects of ocrelizumab may not be immediately noticeable.  Improvements in MS symptoms and disease progression often take time to become apparent, and regular monitoring is essential to assess treatment response.

* **Q: How is Ocrelizumab stored?** A:  Ocrelizumab is administered intravenously by a healthcare professional and does not require storage by the patient.  The specific storage requirements for the medication are handled by the healthcare facility.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Ocrelizumab?** A: There are no specific restrictions on alcohol consumption while taking ocrelizumab. However, excessive alcohol use can affect general health, so it's advisable to maintain moderation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a scheduled dose of ocrelizumab.  Do not attempt to adjust the schedule yourself.

* **Q:  Can I take other medications while on Ocrelizumab?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as there may be potential interactions. Some medications should be avoided during Ocrelizumab treatment.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Ocrelizumab?** A: Long-term effects are still being studied, but potential risks include infections and malignancies.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is crucial.
