# Oxomemazine
### Generic Name
Oxomemazine

### Usage
Oxomemazine is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of dry or irritating coughs.  It's also used to alleviate symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions) and to manage itching associated with various skin conditions (pruritic skin disorders).  While it can provide temporary relief from these symptoms, it doesn't address the underlying cause of the condition.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Cough:** 3.3 mg four times a day (QID) as needed, ensuring at least a 4-hour interval between doses.
* **Pruritic skin disorders/hypersensitivity reactions:** 5-13 mg daily, divided into several doses.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage is weight-based and varies significantly depending on the child's age and weight.  Always follow the prescription instructions provided by the physician.  Examples include:


* **Cough (children aged 2-12 years):** Dosage is calculated based on a total daily dose of 0.33 mg/kg. For example:
    * Children weighing 13-20 kg: 1.65 mg two to three times daily as needed (at least 4 hours apart).
    * Children weighing 20-30 kg: 3.3 mg two to three times daily as needed (at least 4 hours apart).
    * Children weighing 30-40 kg: 3.3 mg three to four times daily as needed (at least 4 hours apart).
    * Children weighing over 40 kg:  Adult dosage.


* **Pruritic skin disorders/hypersensitivity reactions (children):**
    * Children aged 0-3 months: 2.5-5 mg/day.
    * Children over 3 months: 5-20 mg/day, divided into two to three doses.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use caution in these patient populations and consult a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include: drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, confusion, ataxia (lack of muscle coordination), and blurred vision.

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can include:  allergic reactions (such as rash, angioedema, anaphylaxis),  changes in blood cell counts (thrombocytopenia, decreased WBC count), urinary retention, palpitations, and visual disturbances.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works

Oxomemazine is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties. It works by binding to histamine H1 receptors on cells in various parts of the body (like the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract).  By blocking histamine's action, it reduces the symptoms associated with histamine release, such as itching, sneezing, and inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Oxomemazine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, those under the age of 2 (except as per specific prescription), those with a history of agranulocytosis (a severe drop in white blood cells), urinary retention, certain types of glaucoma, pyloric stenosis, prostatic adenoma, myasthenia gravis, status asthmaticus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), paralytic ileus, and angle-closure glaucoma. Concurrent use with MAO inhibitors and certain dopaminergic drugs is also contraindicated.
* **Interactions:** Oxomemazine can interact with other medications, particularly those that cause central nervous system (CNS) depression (like barbiturates, hypnotics, opioids, and sedatives), and MAO inhibitors. The combination may enhance sedative effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Oxomemazine is classified as Category C for pregnancy risk. It's generally advised to avoid use during the first trimester and to exercise caution during later stages. It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is not recommended while using oxomemazine.
* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with severe heart disease, hepatic or renal impairment, a history of seizures, prostate disorders, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, fructose intolerance, or those following a sodium-restricted diet.  It can impair alertness and coordination, so avoid driving or operating machinery.


### FAQs
