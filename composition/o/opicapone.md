# Opicapone
### Generic Name
Opicapone

### Usage
Opicapone is used to treat Parkinson's disease.  Specifically, it's an add-on medication taken with levodopa/carbidopa. Its primary purpose is to reduce the severity and duration of "off" periods.  "Off" periods are times when Parkinson's symptoms return despite medication, leading to stiffness, tremors, and difficulty with movement.  Opicapone doesn't treat Parkinson's disease itself, but helps manage a specific symptom related to the disease's treatment.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Parkinson's Disease):** The standard adult dose is 50 mg once daily at bedtime. This is always given in addition to levodopa/carbidopa.  When stopping Opicapone, careful monitoring is needed, and adjustments to other Parkinson's medications may be necessary.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Opicapone's safety and effectiveness have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  No adjustment is needed for mild impairment. For moderate impairment, reduce the dose to 25 mg once daily at bedtime.  Opicapone should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally needed for mild to moderate renal impairment. However, close monitoring is necessary for those with severe impairment, and the medication should be discontinued if problems occur.  Opicapone should be avoided in patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <15 mL/minute).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (frequency >10%):**

* Dyskinesia (involuntary movements)

**Other Side Effects (frequency 1-10%):**

* Nervous system:  Aggressive behavior, agitation, delusions, dizziness, hallucinations, impulse control disorders, insomnia
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension, increased serum creatine kinase levels, presyncope, syncope
* Gastrointestinal: Constipation, dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Endocrine and metabolic: Weight loss


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:** Sleep driving, sudden onset of sleep.

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Opicapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor.  COMT is an enzyme that breaks down levodopa, a key medication used to treat Parkinson's disease. By inhibiting COMT, Opicapone helps to prevent the breakdown of levodopa, thus increasing the amount of levodopa available to the brain.  This leads to a more consistent and effective control of Parkinson's symptoms and a reduction in "off" periods.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Opicapone is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, or other catecholamine-secreting tumors. It should also not be used with non-selective MAO inhibitors.

**Interactions:**  Opicapone interacts with non-selective MAO inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, isocarboxazid, tranylcypromine) and drugs metabolized by COMT (e.g., isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine).  These interactions can increase the risk of irregular heartbeat, increased heart rate, and blood pressure fluctuations.

**Warnings:**  Opicapone may increase the risk of hypotension (low blood pressure) or syncope (fainting), dyskinesia, hallucinations, psychosis, withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia (fever) and confusion, impulse control/compulsive disorders, and falling asleep during daily activities.  Use with caution in patients with suspected or diagnosed dopamine dysregulation syndrome, severe renal impairment, mild to moderate hepatic impairment, or when performing tasks requiring alertness.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Opicapone may cause harm to a developing fetus. Its excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using Opicapone during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I eat while taking Opicapone?** A:  No, avoid eating for one hour before and one hour after taking Opicapone.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the next dose at the usual time the following day. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store Opicapone?** A: Store as directed on the prescription label. Typically, this involves keeping it at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q:  Can Opicapone cause sleepiness?** A: Yes, sleepiness and even sleep driving are possible side effects.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel drowsy.
