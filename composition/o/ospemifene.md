# Ospemifene
### Generic Name
Ospemifene

### Usage
Ospemifene is primarily used to treat moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) and vaginal dryness in postmenopausal women.  These symptoms are often associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy (thinning and inflammation of the vaginal walls) resulting from declining estrogen levels after menopause.  While its primary application focuses on these menopausal symptoms, it's crucial to remember that ospemifene is not a hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

### Dosage
The standard dosage for adult postmenopausal women is 60 mg orally once daily for both dyspareunia and vaginal dryness.  There is no established dosage for children, and ospemifene is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for those with mild or moderate renal impairment.  However, for individuals with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C),  dosage adjustment is not provided in the manufacturer's labeling and use is not recommended.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include hot flushes.

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

* Headache
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Night sweats
* Endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining)
* Vaginal discharge
* Endometrial polyps
* Vaginal hemorrhage
* Muscle spasms

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports) include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Benign or malignant neoplasms (tumors)
* Cerebrovascular accident (stroke)
* Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein)
* Endometrial cancer
* Erythematous rash (red, inflamed rash)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)
* Urticaria (hives)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  This means it acts differently on estrogen receptors in various tissues throughout the body.  In the vaginal tissue, ospemifene acts as an estrogen agonist, meaning it mimics the effects of estrogen, helping to increase vaginal lubrication and reduce vaginal dryness and thinning. However, in other tissues such as the endometrium (uterine lining), it can have estrogen antagonistic effects, potentially reducing the risk of certain side effects associated with traditional estrogen replacement therapies.


### Precautions
Ospemifene is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to ospemifene or any of its components.
* Undiagnosed genital bleeding.
* Active or history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
* Active or history of arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke or heart attack).
* Known or suspected estrogen-dependent tumor.
* Pregnancy or potential for pregnancy (Category X pregnancy risk).


Ospemifene should be used cautiously in patients with a history of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.  Regular monitoring is important, especially for any signs of unusual vaginal bleeding.  It's also essential to inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.  For example, concurrent use with other estrogens or certain antifungal medications (like fluconazole) may affect ospemifene's effectiveness or lead to increased side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Ospemifene?**  A:  Improvement in symptoms may begin within 1-3 months of starting treatment, but full benefit may take longer.

* **Q: Can I take Ospemifene if I have a history of blood clots?** A: No. Ospemifene is contraindicated in individuals with a history of blood clots (thromboembolic events) due to an increased risk.

* **Q:  Should I stop taking Ospemifene before surgery?** A:  Discuss with your doctor; it may be advisable to discontinue use several weeks before elective surgery, especially if the surgery carries a higher risk of blood clots.

* **Q:  How should I store Ospemifene?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I breastfeed while taking Ospemifene?** A: No, breastfeeding is not recommended while using Ospemifene as its excretion in breast milk is unknown.
