# Ofloxacin + Ketorolac

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Ketorolac (combination not commonly available as a single, fixed-dose product)


**Usage:**  Ofloxacin and Ketorolac are *not* typically combined in a single pharmaceutical product.  They are often prescribed separately to treat different aspects of the same condition, most commonly eye infections.  Their use together would be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's needs.

* **Ofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eye, such as conjunctivitis (pink eye).
* **Ketorolac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain and inflammation, often in the eye following surgery or due to injury or infection.


**Side Effects:** The side effects listed below are possible when each drug is used individually. The likelihood and severity of side effects will vary depending on the individual, dosage, and duration of use.  A doctor should be consulted if any side effects occur.

* **Ofloxacin (eye drops):** Eye irritation, burning, stinging, blurred vision, headache.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.
* **Ketorolac (eye drops):** Eye irritation, burning, stinging, blurred vision, increased risk of eye infection.  Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.  Systemic side effects are less common with topical use but can include gastrointestinal upset, stomach ulcers, kidney problems, and increased bleeding risk if taken orally.


**How it Works:**

* **Ofloxacin:**  It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This action leads to bacterial cell death.
* **Ketorolac:**  It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.
