# Oxytetracycline
### Generic Name
Oxytetracycline

### Usage

Oxytetracycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic effective against a wide range of bacterial infections. Its primary use is in treating various bacterial infections, including:

*   **Brucellosis:** A bacterial infection affecting primarily livestock but transmissible to humans.
*   **Skin infections:**  Such as acne vulgaris (common acne) and severe rosacea (a chronic skin condition).
*   **Ophthalmic infections:** Infections of the eye.
*   **Syphilis:** A sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacteria *Treponema pallidum*.
*   **Urethritis:** Inflammation of the urethra, particularly non-gonococcal urethritis caused by *Ureaplasma urealyticum*.
*   **Streptococcal infections:** Infections caused by *Streptococcus* bacteria.  This includes some forms of pneumonia and skin infections.  


While not always its first-line treatment, oxytetracycline may also be used for other bacterial infections depending on the specific bacteria involved and physician's judgment.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age, weight, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  The following information is for general guidance only and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**  Dosage forms include oral capsules/tablets, intramuscular (IM) injections, topical creams, and ophthalmic solutions/ointments.  Dosage ranges from 250-500mg every 6 hours orally for many infections, up to a maximum of 4g/day.  For specific infections like brucellosis or syphilis,  longer durations and higher doses may be prescribed, often in conjunction with other medications.  Intramuscular injections are used in specific situations and have their own dosage guidelines (e.g., 100mg every 8 hours). Topical and ophthalmic applications will have specific instructions based on the formulation.


**Children:** Oxytetracycline is generally avoided in children under 8 years of age for oral forms and under 12 for injectable forms due to potential staining of teeth.  For older children (8+ years oral, 12+ years injectable), dosage is typically calculated based on weight (e.g., 25-50mg/kg/day divided into 4 doses) but this must be determined by a doctor.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Renal and hepatic impairment significantly impact how the body processes oxytetracycline. Its use is generally contraindicated in patients with severe liver or kidney disease. If use is unavoidable in patients with some degree of renal impairment, reduced doses and extended dosing intervals are necessary, guided by the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR).


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Abdominal distress
*   Oral thrush (candidiasis)
*   Skin rash


Less common but potentially serious side effects:

*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)
*   Photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity)
*   Blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia)
*   Inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis)
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)


If you experience any side effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Oxytetracycline is a bacteriostatic antibiotic meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria rather than directly killing them. It works by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit within bacterial cells, interfering with protein synthesis.  This prevents the bacteria from producing essential proteins, halting their growth and replication.

### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Oxytetracycline is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to tetracyclines, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children under 8 years (oral) or 12 (injectable) years old.  It's also contraindicated in individuals with severe liver or kidney disease.  Avoid in patients receiving vitamin A or retinoid therapy and those with porphyria or systemic lupus erythematosus.

*   **Drug Interactions:**  Oxytetracycline can interact with numerous medications including antacids, calcium supplements, iron supplements, and certain antibiotics (penicillins).  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor before starting oxytetracycline.

*   **Warnings:**   Prolonged exposure to sunlight should be avoided during treatment.  The medication can cause permanent discoloration of teeth in developing children and pregnant women.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take oxytetracycline with dairy products?** A: No. Dairy products can significantly reduce absorption. Take it on an empty stomach.

*   **Q: How should I store oxytetracycline?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking oxytetracycline once I feel better?** A: No. Complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better, to prevent recurrence of infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.

*   **Q: Is oxytetracycline safe during pregnancy?** A: No, it is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of tooth discoloration and bone problems in the developing fetus.  Inform your physician immediately if you become pregnant while using this drug.
