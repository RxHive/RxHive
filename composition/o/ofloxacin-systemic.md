# Ofloxacin (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Ofloxacin (Systemic)

### Usage

Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class.  It's primarily used to treat bacterial infections in various parts of the body.  Its main applications include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
* **Skin and skin-structure infections:**  Both uncomplicated and complicated infections.
* **Genitourinary infections:**  This includes infections like urethral and cervical gonorrhea (though the CDC no longer recommends fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated gonorrhea), urethritis, cervicitis, acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), cystitis (bladder infection), prostatitis (prostate infection), and urosepsis (infection of the bloodstream originating from the urinary tract).
* **Other infections:** Ofloxacin may also be used off-label for conditions such as epididymitis, leprosy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and traveler's diarrhea.  Off-label use means the medication is used for a condition not specifically listed in its official approval.  Always consult a doctor before using a medication off-label.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the type and severity of the infection, the patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  Always follow your doctor's prescription carefully.  The following are examples and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice:

**Adults:** Oral and intravenous (IV) dosages are available. Specific doses and durations are detailed below; however, consult a physician for accurate dosage information.

* **Acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis/community-acquired pneumonia:** 400 mg every 12 hours for 10 days (oral) or 200-400 mg every 12 hours for 7-10 days (IV).
* **Skin and skin-structure infections:** 400 mg every 12 hours for 10 days (oral) or 400 mg every 12 hours for 7-10 days (IV).
* **Cervicitis/urethritis (nongonococcal):** 300 mg every 12 hours for 7 days (oral).
* **Acute pelvic inflammatory disease:** 400 mg every 12 hours for 10-14 days (oral or IV).  Often used in combination with metronidazole.
* **Prostatitis:**  Doses vary greatly from 200mg to 400mg every 12 hours for several weeks, depending on whether it is an acute or chronic infection and response to treatment.
* **Urinary tract infections:** Dosages range from 200mg every 12 hours for several days to 400mg every 12 hours for up to 10 days depending on the type of infection (uncomplicated or complicated).


**Children:**  The dosage for children is typically calculated based on weight (15 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours).  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  A doctor will adjust the dose based on individual kidney function (creatinine clearance).

### How it Works

Ofloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic. This means it kills bacteria. It achieves this by inhibiting two crucial bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. By blocking these enzymes, ofloxacin prevents bacterial cells from multiplying and ultimately leads to their death.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Ofloxacin should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to ofloxacin, other fluoroquinolones, or any component of the medication.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Ofloxacin is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.
* **Kidney and liver disease:** Dosage adjustments are needed for individuals with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Central nervous system (CNS) disorders:** Use caution in patients with epilepsy or other CNS conditions that lower the seizure threshold.
* **Myasthenia gravis:** Ofloxacin can worsen muscle weakness in patients with this condition.
* **Tendon problems:** Ofloxacin may increase the risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture, particularly in older adults and those using corticosteroids.
* **Drug interactions:** Ofloxacin may interact with several other medications. Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Photosensitivity:** Avoid excessive sun exposure while taking ofloxacin.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ofloxacin with food?** A:  For oral administration, ofloxacin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store ofloxacin?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I stop taking ofloxacin once I feel better?** A: No, complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if you feel better.  Stopping early can lead to resistant bacteria.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is ofloxacin safe for long-term use?** A: Generally, long-term use is not recommended unless absolutely necessary and under strict medical supervision.  Long-term use increases the risk of side effects.  Discuss this carefully with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience a serious side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects, such as tendon pain, seizures, or allergic reactions.
