# Opium Tincture
### Generic Name
Opium Tincture

### Usage
Opium tincture is primarily used to treat diarrhea in adults.  It's an opioid analgesic and antidiarrheal agent, meaning it relieves pain and reduces bowel movements. While its primary use is for diarrhea, it has been used off-label in the management of diarrhea associated with cancer treatment.  However, it's crucial to remember that this is not an FDA-approved indication and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.  The use of opium tincture should always be guided by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
**Important Note:** Opium tincture contains morphine (10 mg/mL).  Dosage should be carefully calculated and administered by a healthcare professional, especially considering the potent nature of this medication. Doses are often expressed in milligrams of morphine or as drops.

**Diarrhea (Adult):** The typical oral dose is 6 mg (0.6 mL) of undiluted tincture four times a day (QID).

**Cancer Treatment-Induced Diarrhea (Off-label, Adult):**  The dosage in this context is generally 10-15 drops of tincture mixed with water, administered every 3-4 hours.  *This is off-label use and requires careful monitoring by a physician.*

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of opium tincture in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nervous system: CNS depression, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, malaise, restlessness
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), palpitations
* Gastrointestinal: Anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps
* Genitourinary: Decreased urine output
* Hypersensitivity: Histamine release (allergic reactions)
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Weakness
* Ophthalmic: Miosis (constricted pupils)
* Respiratory: Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing)


Less common, but serious side effects include:  drug dependence, increased intracranial pressure, and hypogonadism (low sex hormone levels with chronic use).  If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Opium tincture contains various opioid alkaloids, most importantly morphine.  Morphine acts on opioid receptors in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. This reduces pain perception (analgesic effect) and slows down bowel movements by decreasing digestive secretions, increasing intestinal muscle tone, and reducing the propulsion of contents through the digestive tract (antidiarrheal effect).


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Opium tincture is contraindicated in children and in cases of diarrhea caused by poisoning until the toxin is eliminated from the gastrointestinal tract.

**Interactions:**  Opium tincture can interact with numerous medications.  It can increase the effects of CNS depressants (alcohol, sedatives, etc.) and potentially interact negatively with certain other medications such as anticholinergics, diuretics, and gastrointestinal prokinetics. It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.

**Warnings:**  Use with extreme caution in patients with:

* Hypovolemia (low blood volume) or cardiovascular disease
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Biliary tract dysfunction
* History of drug abuse or alcoholism
* GI hemorrhage
* Head injury or elevated intracranial pressure
* Hepatic (liver) dysfunction
* Morbid obesity
* Prostatic hyperplasia or urinary stricture
* Pre-existing respiratory compromise
* Thyroid dysfunction
* Debilitated or elderly patients
* Pregnant or breastfeeding women

Patients should avoid operating machinery or driving while taking opium tincture due to the risk of drowsiness and CNS depression.  The alcohol content of the tincture should also be considered in patients with alcohol dependence or liver disease.
