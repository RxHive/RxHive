**How it Works:** Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting the activity of bacterial enzymes called topoisomerases (specifically DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV).  These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. By inhibiting these enzymes, ofloxacin prevents bacterial cells from reproducing and ultimately kills them.
