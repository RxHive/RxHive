# Ofloxacin + Lactobacillus

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Lactobacillus (Various brand names exist, as the combination isn't universally standardized.  The specific brand name will contain the individual drug names)

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat bacterial infections of the female reproductive tract, particularly those accompanied by vaginal dysbiosis (an imbalance of vaginal flora).  The ofloxacin component targets the bacteria causing the infection, while the lactobacillus component helps restore the normal, healthy vaginal bacterial balance.  **It's crucial to understand that this is not a standard or universally prescribed combination.  A doctor's prescription is essential.**  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.  The specific indication will be determined by a physician based on individual diagnosis.

**Side Effects:**

* **Ofloxacin Related:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight), vaginal itching or burning, allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Rare but serious side effects include tendonitis (inflammation of tendons), tendon rupture, seizures, and central nervous system effects.
* **Lactobacillus Related:** Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal upset or allergic reactions, though these are uncommon.  The lactobacillus strain used will influence the potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Ofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  This ultimately prevents bacterial growth and leads to their death.
* **Lactobacillus:** Lactobacillus species are beneficial bacteria naturally found in the vagina.  They produce lactic acid, which maintains an acidic vaginal pH, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria and yeast.  Supplementing with lactobacillus aims to restore the normal vaginal flora after it's been disrupted by infection or antibiotics.  The combination therapy aims to treat the infection with ofloxacin and simultaneously restore the healthy vaginal environment with lactobacillus.
