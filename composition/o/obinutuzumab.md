# Obinutuzumab
### Generic Name
Obinutuzumab

### Usage
Obinutuzumab is a type of medication called a monoclonal antibody.  It targets a protein called CD20, found on the surface of certain white blood cells, specifically B-lymphocytes. By binding to CD20, obinutuzumab helps destroy these cells. This makes it useful in treating specific types of blood cancers where these cells are involved.

Its primary use is in the treatment of previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults, typically in combination with chlorambucil, a chemotherapy drug.  

Obinutuzumab also has important roles in treating follicular lymphoma (FL):

* **Previously untreated FL:**  It's used in combination with chemotherapy (bendamustine or other regimens like CHOP or CVP), followed by obinutuzumab monotherapy (treatment with obinutuzumab alone) for patients who achieve at least a partial remission. This approach is often used for patients with more advanced stages of the disease (II bulky, III, or IV).
* **Relapsed or refractory FL:** This means FL that has returned after treatment or hasn't responded to previous treatments. In these cases, obinutuzumab is used in combination with bendamustine.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific cancer being treated and the patient's individual response.  The information below is a summary and should not replace the instructions provided by a healthcare professional.  Dosage is always determined and adjusted by a physician based on individual patient needs and response to treatment.  

**Important Note:** The administration of obinutuzumab requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional due to the potential for infusion reactions.  Premedication is often used to minimize these risks.  Always follow the specific instructions provided by the prescribing physician.

**Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):**  Intravenous (IV) infusion over several hours, typically given over six 28-day cycles, in combination with chlorambucil. The exact schedule and dosage of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil will be tailored by your oncologist.

**Follicular Lymphoma (FL):**  Intravenous (IV) infusion. The dosage schedule depends on whether the FL is previously untreated or relapsed/refractory and the specific chemotherapy regimen used. Previously untreated FL patients may receive obinutuzumab with bendamustine over six 28-day cycles, or with other chemotherapy regimens over a different number of cycles, followed by maintenance obinutuzumab monotherapy. Relapsed/refractory FL patients receive obinutuzumab with bendamustine. The infusion rate is carefully adjusted based on the patient's tolerance to previous infusions. For maintenance therapy, obinutuzumab is given every two months for up to two years.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of obinutuzumab in children have not been established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Cough
* Pneumonia
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Anemia
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Infusion reactions (allergic-type reactions during infusion)
* Increased liver enzyme levels


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Tumor lysis syndrome (rapid breakdown of cancer cells, potentially leading to kidney problems)
* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) â€“ a rare and serious brain infection
* Hepatitis B reactivation
* Serious infections


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Obinutuzumab is a type II monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein found on the surface of B cells.  It works through several mechanisms to destroy cancerous B cells:

* **Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC):**  Obinutuzumab marks the cancerous B cells for destruction by other immune cells.
* **Antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP):** Obinutuzumab helps immune cells engulf and destroy the cancerous B cells.
* **Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC):**  Obinutuzumab triggers the complement system, part of the immune system, to directly kill the cancerous B cells.

These actions lead to the reduction of cancerous B cells and help control the progression of the disease.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Obinutuzumab is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to it or its components.  Those with a history of serum sickness following obinutuzumab should avoid it.
* **Infusion Reactions:**  Severe infusion reactions can occur and require careful monitoring and management by healthcare professionals. Premedication is often used to reduce the risk.
* **Infections:**  Obinutuzumab weakens the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.  Patients should be monitored closely for signs of infection.
* **Tumor Lysis Syndrome:**  This is a potential risk, particularly in patients with a high tumor burden.  Prophylactic measures may be needed.
* **Hepatitis B Reactivation:**  There's a risk of reactivating Hepatitis B. Screening for Hepatitis B is crucial before starting treatment.
* **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):**  A rare but serious brain infection is a potential risk.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Obinutuzumab can harm the fetus, and women of childbearing age should use effective contraception.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for six months after the last dose.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Obinutuzumab may interact with other medications, including live vaccines and immunosuppressants. Discuss all medications with your healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is obinutuzumab administered?** A: It is administered intravenously (IV) as an infusion.  The infusion rate is carefully controlled and monitored by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How long does treatment with obinutuzumab last?** A: The duration of treatment varies widely, depending on the type of cancer, treatment regimen, and individual patient response.  It can range from several cycles to more than a year, sometimes including a maintenance phase.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss rescheduling.

* **Q: How should obinutuzumab be stored?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your pharmacist.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of obinutuzumab?** A: Like all medications, obinutuzumab has potential long-term effects, such as an increased risk of infections or other complications.  Your healthcare provider will monitor for and manage these risks.

* **Q: Can I receive vaccinations while on obinutuzumab?** A:  Live vaccines are generally not recommended during obinutuzumab treatment or until B cell recovery.  Discuss this with your healthcare provider.
