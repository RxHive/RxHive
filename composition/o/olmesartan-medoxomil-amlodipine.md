# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Amlodipine

**Generic Name:** Olmesartan Medoxomil/Amlodipine Besylate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It contains two medications: olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and amlodipine besylate, a calcium channel blocker.  By working together, they lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular complications.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and health status.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects may include:

* **Headache:**  A frequent side effect, often mild and transient.
* **Dizziness:** Can be due to blood pressure lowering effects.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Swelling in ankles/feet (edema):**  More common with amlodipine.
* **Cough:** Less common than with ACE inhibitors, but still possible.
* **Constipation:**  More common with olmesartan.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Fast or irregular heartbeat:** Seek immediate medical attention.
* **Shortness of breath:** Could indicate a more serious issue.
* **Chest pain (angina):** Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms like rash, itching, swelling of the face/tongue/throat. Seek immediate medical attention.
* **Increased potassium levels (hyperkalemia):** Especially in patients with kidney problems.
* **Liver problems:**  Monitor for signs such as jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes).


This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil:** This ARB blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking this action, blood vessels relax and widen, reducing blood pressure.
* **Amlodipine Besylate:** This calcium channel blocker relaxes blood vessels by reducing the flow of calcium into the cells of blood vessel walls. This relaxation lowers blood pressure.

The combination of these two medications provides a more effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone, often allowing for lower doses of each, potentially minimizing individual side effects.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions can occur.  Some medications, particularly those affecting kidney function or potassium levels, may not be suitable to combine with this drug.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** Alcohol can lower blood pressure and may increase the risk of side effects, so it's best to limit or avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication.
* **Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** No.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure, potentially causing serious health problems.  Always consult your doctor before stopping or changing the dosage.
* **Who shouldn't take this medication?**  This medication is not suitable for everyone. People with certain conditions, such as severe liver or kidney problems, or those allergic to either olmesartan or amlodipine, should not take this medication.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also discuss this medication with their doctor.
