# Ofloxacin + Ornidazole + Sodium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Ornidazole + Sodium Chloride

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat various bacterial and protozoal infections, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and respiratory tract.  The specific infections treated vary depending on the formulation and the prescribing physician's judgment.  It's commonly used for conditions like:

* **Infections of the gastrointestinal tract:**  Diarrhoea, dysentery caused by susceptible bacteria and protozoa.
* **Infections of the urinary tract (UTIs):**  Urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Infections of the respiratory tract:** Some respiratory infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Gynecological infections:** Certain gynecological infections caused by susceptible bacteria.


**Important Note:** This medication is a prescription-only medicine. The usage will be determined by a doctor based on the specific infection, its severity, and the patient's medical history.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.

**Side Effects:** Like all medications, this combination can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  These can be mild or severe.  Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.
* **Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema), difficulty breathing (anaphylaxis â€“ a medical emergency).
* **Other:**  Vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis), changes in taste, metallic taste, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).

This is not an exhaustive list.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe or unusual side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Ofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting the bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By inhibiting these enzymes, ofloxacin prevents bacterial growth and ultimately kills them.
* **Ornidazole:** This is a nitroimidazole antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent.  It works by disrupting the DNA of susceptible microorganisms, leading to their death.  It's effective against various bacteria and protozoa.
* **Sodium Chloride:** This is a common salt added primarily as a filler and to help with the formulation and absorption of the drug. It doesn't have a direct antimicrobial effect.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication while pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Generally, no.  Fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential adverse effects on the fetus and infant. Ornidazole use should also be carefully considered during these periods. Consult your doctor immediately.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  No. Alcohol should be avoided while taking this medication as it can interact with ornidazole and increase the risk of side effects.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **How long should I take this medication?**  The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor and depends on the infection's severity and your response to the treatment.  Do not stop taking the medication prematurely, even if you feel better.
* **What are the contraindications?** This combination is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones, nitroimidazoles, or any of the excipients.  It should be used with caution in patients with certain medical conditions like epilepsy, neurological disorders, or liver/kidney impairment.
