# Oxetacaine + Aluminium Hydroxide + Magnesium
### Generic Name
Oxetacaine + Aluminium Hydroxide + Magnesium

**Note:** This combination is not a single, universally recognized generic medicine with a single, standardized name.  The combination of oxetacaine, aluminum hydroxide, and magnesium is typically found in over-the-counter antacid and analgesic products.  The specific brand name and exact formulation will vary depending on the manufacturer.  This information provides general guidance based on the common uses and properties of these individual ingredients; always refer to the product-specific labeling for complete information.

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used for the relief of heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach associated with excess stomach acid.

* **Oxetacaine:** A local anesthetic that numbs the affected area, providing temporary relief from pain and discomfort associated with irritation of the esophagus and stomach lining.
* **Aluminum Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide:** Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Aluminum hydroxide works by binding to excess acid, while magnesium hydroxide helps neutralize and also has a laxative effect which can help with constipation sometimes associated with antacids.  The combination often provides a more balanced effect than using either antacid alone.

The primary use is symptomatic relief. It doesn't treat the underlying cause of excess stomach acid; it only manages the symptoms.  It is not intended for long-term use.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation.  Always follow the instructions printed on the product label.  Generally:

* **Oral:**  The usual adult dose is one or two tablets or a specified amount of liquid antacid as directed, typically repeated every 2 to 4 hours as needed, but not exceeding the maximum daily dose.
* **Children:**  This medication is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age without consulting a pediatrician.  The use in children requires careful consideration due to the potential for interaction with other medications and the risk of side effects.  An appropriate pediatric formulation may be available, if prescribed by a physician.
* **IV:** This combination is not administered intravenously.  Oxetacaine, aluminium hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide are not suitable for intravenous use.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Constipation (more likely with aluminum hydroxide), diarrhea (more likely with magnesium hydroxide), gas, and mild stomach upset.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  While rare, prolonged or excessive use can lead to electrolyte imbalances (especially magnesium and aluminum).  These imbalances can cause muscle weakness, confusion, or other serious symptoms. Aluminum accumulation can also be a concern with long-term high doses.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Allergic reactions, while uncommon, can occur. Symptoms might include rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction is suspected.

**If you experience any side effects, especially those that are persistent or severe, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.**


### How it Works

* **Oxetacaine:** Works by blocking nerve impulses in the affected area, thereby reducing the sensation of pain and discomfort.
* **Aluminum Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide:**  Neutralize stomach acid through a chemical reaction.  They bind with hydrogen ions (H+) in gastric acid, reducing the acidity of the stomach contents and relieving the symptoms of heartburn and indigestion. The combination helps to balance potential side effects.  Magnesium hydroxide can also stimulate bowel movements.

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with known allergies to any of its components.  It should be used with caution in individuals with kidney or liver disease.
