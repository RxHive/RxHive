# Oxybutynin
### Generic Name
Oxybutynin

### Usage

Oxybutynin is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  This condition is characterized by symptoms like urinary urgency (a sudden, strong urge to urinate), frequency (urinating more often than usual), and urge incontinence (accidental leakage of urine due to urgency).  It's effective because it relaxes the bladder muscle, allowing it to hold more urine and reducing the frequency of urination and incontinence episodes.

Oxybutynin also has an off-label use in treating primary focal hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating in specific areas of the body), though this application is not as widely studied or established as its use for OAB. In children aged 6 and older, it's used to treat detrusor overactivity associated with neurological conditions such as spina bifida.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation (immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, topical gel, transdermal patch), the age of the patient (adult vs. child), and the condition being treated.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's precise instructions.  Below is a summary; however, this information should *not* replace the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Adults (Overactive Bladder):**

* **Immediate-release tablets:** Typically start at 5 mg twice or three times daily, increasing as needed and tolerated, up to a maximum of 5 mg four times daily.  Elderly patients often begin with a lower dose (2.5 mg twice or three times daily).
* **Extended-release tablets:** Usually begin at 5-10 mg once daily, adjusted as needed in 5 mg increments every 1-2 weeks, to a maximum of 30 mg once daily.
* **Topical gel:** One sachet (100 mg/g) or one pump actuation (100 mg/g) once daily.
* **Transdermal patch:** One 3.9 mg/day patch applied twice weekly (every 3-4 days).  For some women, an every-four-days regimen may be used (refer to the OTC labelling).

**Children (Overactive Bladder â€“ Neurogenic):**

Dosage is determined by weight and age, and administration methods include immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and even intravesical administration (directly into the bladder).  Specific dosing should be determined and monitored by a pediatrician or specialist.


**Adults (Primary Focal Hyperhidrosis - Off-Label):**  Dosage is not standardized for this condition and needs to be determined under medical supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) often include:

* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness

Less common but potentially serious side effects can include:

* Urinary retention (inability to urinate)
* Increased heart rate
* Confusion
* Hallucinations
* Allergic reactions

If any adverse effects occur, particularly those listed as serious, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic drug.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes the bladder muscle to contract. By blocking this action, oxybutynin relaxes the bladder muscle, increasing its capacity and reducing the frequency and urgency of urination.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Oxybutynin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it, uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders (e.g., gastric retention), myasthenia gravis, and certain severe GI conditions.
* **Interactions:**  Oxybutynin can interact with other medications, especially other anticholinergic drugs.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Specific Populations:** Use caution in elderly patients, those with hepatic or renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, or GI motility issues, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.  The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin in children are established only for specific conditions (neurogenic detrusor overactivity) and require close medical monitoring.
* **Warnings:**  Oxybutynin can cause drowsiness and blurred vision; avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.  Heat prostration (overheating) is also a risk.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take oxybutynin with alcohol?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking oxybutynin, as alcohol can worsen drowsiness and other side effects.
* **Q: How should I store oxybutynin?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of effects varies depending on the formulation.  It might take a few days or weeks to experience full benefits.
* **Q: Can I stop taking oxybutynin suddenly?** A:  No, it's generally recommended to gradually reduce the dosage under your doctor's supervision to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
