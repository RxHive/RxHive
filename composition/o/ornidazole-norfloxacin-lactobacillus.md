# Ornidazole + Norfloxacin + Lactobacillus
### Generic Name
Ornidazole + Norfloxacin + Lactobacillus

**Note:**  This combination is not a standard, pre-formulated generic medication. It represents a combination of three distinct drugs frequently prescribed *together* to treat specific infections, often gastrointestinal infections.  The exact formulation (dosage of each component and excipients) would vary depending on the manufacturer and specific product. Always refer to the product labeling for precise details.

### Usage

This combination therapy is primarily used to treat infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by bacteria and protozoa sensitive to ornidazole and norfloxacin.  Ornidazole is an antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent effective against various anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, including *Entamoeba histolytica* (amoebiasis), *Giardia lamblia* (giardiasis), and *Trichomonas vaginalis* (trichomoniasis). Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic active against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria, commonly involved in gastrointestinal infections. Lactobacillus is a probiotic, included to help restore the balance of the gut flora often disrupted by the antibiotics.

This combination is often prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Amoebiasis:** Infection with *Entamoeba histolytica*.
* **Bacterial gastroenteritis:** Infection of the stomach and intestines caused by bacteria.
* **Diarrhoea** associated with bacterial or protozoal infections.
* **Mixed infections:** Infections involving both bacteria and protozoa.

**Important Note:** This is not a first-line treatment for all these conditions.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriateness of this combination based on the specific infection and individual patient factors.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation, the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  There is no single standardized dosage for this combined therapy as it is not a pre-made product.  A healthcare professional will prescribe the correct dosage of ornidazole, norfloxacin, and lactobacillus for each individual case.  The medication may be administered orally (tablets, capsules, suspensions) and the lactobacillus may be in the form of capsules. Instructions will be provided by the prescribing doctor or pharmacist.

**It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage exactly and not to adjust it without consulting a doctor.**



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhoea (possibly worsened or prolonged due to antibiotic use, then improved with probiotic)
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile* infection (a severe form of diarrhoea)
* Tendonitis or tendon rupture (with norfloxacin)
* Seizures (with ornidazole, particularly in patients with pre-existing neurological conditions)
* Liver damage (with ornidazole)
* Changes in blood counts (with ornidazole)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Ornidazole disrupts the DNA of protozoa and anaerobic bacteria, leading to their death. Norfloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis, preventing bacterial growth and replication.  Lactobacillus acts as a probiotic, introducing beneficial bacteria into the gut to help restore the normal gut flora, counteract the disruptive effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and improve gut health.  The combined action of these three drugs works to eliminate the infection and minimize the negative impact of antibiotic treatment on the gut's natural bacteria.
