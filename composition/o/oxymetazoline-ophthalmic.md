# Oxymetazoline (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Oxymetazoline (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Oxymetazoline ophthalmic solution is primarily used to treat acquired blepharoptosis in adults.  Blepharoptosis refers to drooping of the eyelid.  This specific formulation is designed for application directly to the eye to address this condition.  It's important to note that this medication is *not* indicated for other eye conditions or for use in children under 13 years of age.


### Dosage
**Adults (Blepharoptosis):** The typical dosage is one drop of 0.1% oxymetazoline ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) once daily.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of oxymetazoline ophthalmic solution have not been established in children under 13 years of age.  It should not be used in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional before adjusting the dose or using this medication if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency not always specified):**

* Headache
* Application-site pain (eye irritation)
* Blurred vision
* Conjunctival hyperemia (redness of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye)
* Dry eye syndrome
* Punctate keratitis (small superficial corneal ulcers)
* Transient burning or stinging in the eyes

**Serious Side Effects (Less Common but Requiring Immediate Medical Attention):** While rare, the development of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (a serious eye condition) is a potential concern.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe eye pain, vision changes, or other signs of glaucoma after using this medication.


### How it Works
Oxymetazoline ophthalmic solution works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the Müller's muscle of the eyelid.  This muscle plays a crucial role in elevating the eyelid.  Stimulation of these receptors causes the Müller's muscle to contract, leading to an elevation of the eyelid and thus alleviating blepharoptosis.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are listed in the manufacturer's labeling; however, this doesn't mean it's suitable for everyone.

**Warnings and Cautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with severe or unstable cardiovascular disease (including orthostatic hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, or uncontrolled hypotension).
* Use with caution in patients with untreated narrow-angle glaucoma.
* Use with caution in patients with cerebral insufficiency, coronary insufficiency, or Sjögren's syndrome.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Oxymetazoline is categorized as pregnancy category C. If ophthalmic treatment is necessary during pregnancy, the lowest effective dose should be used with punctal occlusion (closing the tear ducts) to minimize fetal exposure. The excretion of oxymetazoline in breast milk after ophthalmic administration is unknown. The decision to breastfeed while using this medication should be made carefully, considering the potential risk to the infant.

**Drug Interactions:** No significant known drug interactions are reported, but always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
