# Oxatomide
### Generic Name
Oxatomide

### Usage
Oxatomide is primarily used as an antihistamine to treat allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and other allergic reactions.  It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  While its primary use is in treating allergic symptoms, it's important to note that it's not suitable for immediate relief of severe allergic reactions like asthma attacks.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For allergic reactions or rhinitis, the typical oral dose is 30 mg twice daily (BID). This may be increased to 60 mg BID if necessary, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Children (over 1 year):** For allergic reactions or rhinitis, the typical oral dose is 0.5 mg/kg BID.  This can be administered as a suspension (preferred), with 0.2 mL (0.5 mg) per kg of body weight given twice daily.  Tablet forms can be used for older children:  15 mg (Â½ tablet) BID for those weighing 15-35 kg, and 30 mg (1 tablet) BID for those weighing over 35 kg.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions and dosage recommendations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For patients with hepatic (liver) impairment, the initial adult dose should be reduced by 50%, while maintaining the twice-daily frequency. Pediatric dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment are based on adult experience and should be used with caution.  Currently, no dosage adjustments are specified for renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Drowsiness

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Gastrointestinal upset (e.g., nausea, xerostomia - dry mouth)
* Weight gain
* Weakness

**Serious But Less Common Side Effects (Frequency not defined or <1%):**  A wide range of serious side effects have been reported, including but not limited to:  nervous system disorders (dizziness, seizures, hallucinations), cardiovascular problems (arrhythmias, hypotension), respiratory issues (bronchospasm), dermatologic reactions (rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hepatic injury (hepatitis, jaundice, liver failure), hematologic effects (anemia, thrombocytopenia), and hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis).  This list is not exhaustive.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Oxatomide is a histamine H1 receptor antagonist.  This means it selectively blocks the histamine H1 receptors on cells, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic reactions.  It also interacts with other receptors involved in allergic responses, such as serotonin (5-HT1), leukotriene (LTC3 and LTC4), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors. By blocking these receptors, oxatomide reduces the release of inflammatory mediators, thus lessening the symptoms of allergic reactions.  Oxatomide also inhibits calcium mobilization in mast cells, reducing the release of allergic mediators from these cells.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Oxatomide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, pregnant or breastfeeding women, premature or full-term neonates, and those with severe hepatic failure.

**Interactions:**  Oxatomide's sedative effects may be enhanced when used with other sedatives (barbiturates, hypnotics, opioid analgesics, anxiolytics, antipsychotics). Concomitant use with aminoglycoside antibiotics should be avoided as oxatomide may mask ototoxicity symptoms.  The anticholinergic effects of atropine, MAO inhibitors, and TCAs may be amplified when used with oxatomide.

**Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, children under 12, the elderly, angle-closure glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or urinary retention, those performing activities requiring mental alertness, pyloroduodenal obstruction, severe cardiovascular disorders, or known or suspected QT interval prolongation.  In asthmatic patients, oxatomide should be tapered, and not withdrawn abruptly.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking oxatomide?**

A: No, alcohol should be avoided as it can potentiate the sedative effects of oxatomide.

**Q: How should I store oxatomide?**

A:  Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

**Q: Is oxatomide safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**

A: No, oxatomide is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**Q:  How long does it take for oxatomide to work?**

A: The onset of action varies, but symptom relief should be noticeable within a reasonable timeframe. Consult your physician if you do not experience improvement.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

**Q: Can I stop taking oxatomide suddenly?**

A:  No, do not stop taking oxatomide abruptly, especially if you're using it for asthma.  Always consult your doctor before stopping any medication.
