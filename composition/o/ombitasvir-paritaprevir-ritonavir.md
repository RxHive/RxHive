# Ombitasvir + Paritaprevir + Ritonavir
### Generic Name
Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir

### Usage
Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir is a combination medication used to treat chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 infection.  It's typically prescribed in conjunction with ribavirin for patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (meaning the liver damage is not severely impacting liver function).  While primarily used for genotype 4,  it may be considered for other genotypes in specific circumstances under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  The combination is often preferred over single-agent therapies due to its enhanced efficacy and reduced risk of drug resistance.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage involves taking two tablets of ombitasvir 12.5 mg, paritaprevir 75 mg, and ritonavir 50 mg once daily (OD) for 12 weeks. This is usually administered with ribavirin.  In some cases, particularly for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis who can't tolerate ribavirin, the combination may be used without ribavirin for the same duration.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on liver and kidney function; it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider for any necessary modifications.  The medication is not currently approved for use in children; therefore, no pediatric dosage is available.

### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include asthenia (weakness or fatigue). Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients may include fatigue, insomnia, nausea, allergic skin reactions, and itching (pruritus). Less common, but potentially serious side effects, include anemia, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased liver enzyme levels (ALT), anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, hepatic failure (especially in those with underlying cirrhosis), hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema), liver decompensation (in patients with underlying cirrhosis), and reactivation of Hepatitis B virus.  If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical advice.

### How it Works
Ombitasvir directly inhibits the NS5A protein of the HCV virus, disrupting viral replication and assembly. Paritaprevir blocks the NS3/4A protease, another crucial viral enzyme needed for replication. Ritonavir itself doesn't directly fight HCV, but it acts as a booster, significantly increasing the blood levels of both ombitasvir and paritaprevir, thereby enhancing their antiviral effects and ensuring better efficacy.  The synergistic effect of these three drugs leads to a potent antiviral action against the virus.

### Precautions
This combination medication is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh class B or C), those with hypersensitivity to ritonavir or any component of the medication, and those concurrently taking certain drugs that interact strongly with the medication's metabolism (CYP3A substrates).  The medication should be used cautiously in diabetic patients due to the potential for hypoglycemia after HCV viral load reduction.  It's also essential to assess for Hepatitis B infection before starting treatment because the drug may cause HBV reactivation, leading to serious complications.  Pregnant women and men with pregnant partners should not use this medication due to potential risks, and breastfeeding is not recommended.  A healthcare professional should be consulted to assess any drug-drug interactions before initiating therapy.
