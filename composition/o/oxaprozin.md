# Oxaprozin
### Generic Name
Oxaprozin

### Usage
Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve the pain, swelling, stiffness, and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  These are both forms of arthritis causing joint pain and damage. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. Oxaprozin helps manage the symptoms of these conditions, improving mobility and reducing discomfort.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For moderate to severe osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, the usual oral dose is 1200 mg daily.  A lower dose of 600 mg daily might be appropriate for individuals with mild disease or low body weight.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 1800 mg (not exceeding 26 mg/kg), ideally divided into smaller doses if a single daily dose is poorly tolerated.  For patients weighing less than 50 kg, those with impaired kidney or liver function, or those at risk of peptic ulcers, the daily dose should not exceed 1200 mg.

**Children:**  For children aged 6 years and older with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the oral dosage is typically 10-20 mg/kg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney impairment.  In patients with severe liver disease, dose reduction should be considered.  For azotemic patients (those with increased nitrogenous waste in the blood) with rheumatoid arthritis, Oxaprozin should be started at 600 mg daily.  In renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis, dose alteration might not be necessary if plasma albumin levels are normal.  Always consult a doctor for specific dosage instructions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Fluid retention and edema (swelling)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat)
* Gastrointestinal issues (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, vomiting)
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Skin reactions (ranging from rash to, in rare cases, serious conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis)


Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* Anemia
*  Bleeding (including gastrointestinal bleeding)
*  Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
*  Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*  Changes in blood cell counts (agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
*  Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, stop taking Oxaprozin and seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Oxaprozin is a propionic acid derivative NSAID.  It works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, Oxaprozin decreases inflammation, pain, and fever, thereby alleviating the symptoms of arthritis.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Oxaprozin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Oxaprozin or any of its components, a history of allergic-type reactions (such as asthma, urticaria) to aspirin or other NSAIDs, and during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

* **Interactions:**  Oxaprozin may interact with several other medications, including aspirin, methotrexate, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, lithium, warfarin, H2-receptor antagonists, and beta-blockers.  These interactions can potentially alter the effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects of Oxaprozin or the other medications. Always inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.

* **Warnings:**  Oxaprozin, like other NSAIDs, carries an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events (e.g., heart attack, stroke) and gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation.  These risks may be higher in elderly patients, patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding, and those taking higher doses or using Oxaprozin for longer periods.  The risk of serious side effects is increased in those with pre-existing conditions, such as hypertension, kidney disease, heart failure and liver disease.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Oxaprozin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been established.  Its use during pregnancy is generally not recommended. The excretion of Oxaprozin into breast milk is unknown, therefore, use caution if breastfeeding.  Consult a doctor before taking Oxaprozin during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Oxaprozin with food?** A: Yes, taking Oxaprozin with food can help reduce the risk of stomach upset.

* **Q: How should I store Oxaprozin?** A: Store Oxaprozin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Oxaprozin suddenly?** A: It's best to follow your doctor's instructions regarding stopping Oxaprozin.  Sudden discontinuation might not be advisable.

* **Q: Is Oxaprozin habit-forming?** A: No, Oxaprozin is not a habit-forming medication.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A:  Stop taking Oxaprozin immediately and seek immediate medical attention.  Allergic reactions to NSAIDs can be serious.
