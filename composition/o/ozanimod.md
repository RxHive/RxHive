# Ozanimod
### Generic Name
Ozanimod

### Usage
Ozanimod is primarily used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults.  This includes individuals with clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS.  It works by modulating the activity of the immune system, specifically reducing the number of lymphocytes that can enter the central nervous system and potentially cause inflammation and damage associated with MS.  Currently, there are no other notable secondary uses approved.

### Dosage
Ozanimod is administered orally.  The dosage for adults with relapsing MS involves a two-week titration period:

* **Titration Phase (Days 1-7):**  The initial dose is 0.23 mg once daily (OD) for the first four days, increasing to 0.46 mg OD for days 5-7.
* **Maintenance Phase (Day 8 onwards):**  The maintenance dose is 0.92 mg OD.

If a dose is missed during the titration period, the titration process should be restarted.  If a dose is missed after the initial two weeks, continue with the next scheduled dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of ozanimod in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Ozanimod is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.  No specific dosage adjustments are needed for patients with renal impairment, according to the manufacturer's labeling.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Infections

**Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)
* Upper abdominal pain
* Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT and transaminases)
* Urinary tract infection
* Lymphocytopenia (low lymphocyte count)
* Back pain

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)
* Macular edema (swelling of the macula in the eye)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypertensive crisis (severely high blood pressure)
* Herpes zoster infection (shingles)
* Basal-cell carcinoma of skin, malignant melanoma, other malignancies
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Decrease in lung function (Forced Vital Capacity and Forced Expiratory Volume)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ozanimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator.  It works by binding to specific S1P receptors (S1P1 and S1P5) on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). This binding prevents lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes, thus reducing their circulation in the peripheral blood and potentially their migration into the central nervous system.  By decreasing the number of lymphocytes that reach the brain and spinal cord, it lessens the inflammation and damage characteristic of MS. The precise mechanism by which this translates into therapeutic benefit in MS is not fully understood.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Ozanimod is contraindicated in patients with a history of recent (within the last six months) myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III or IV heart failure; those with Mobitz type II second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sinoatrial block (unless they have a functioning pacemaker); those with severe untreated sleep apnea; and those currently taking a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor.

**Warnings:**  Ozanimod can increase the risk of infections due to its effect on the immune system.  It can also increase the risk of bradyarrhythmia (slow heart rhythm), atrioventricular conduction delays, liver injury, hypertension, macular edema, reduced lung function, RPLS, and potentially progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).  Use with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease or those receiving other immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies.  Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and for three months after treatment. Co-administration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors or BCRP inhibitors is not recommended, and strong CYP2C8 inducers should be avoided.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ozanimod may harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for three months after stopping treatment.  It is unknown whether ozanimod is excreted in breast milk.  The benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against potential risks to the infant.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ozanimod with other medications?** A:  Consult your doctor about potential drug interactions, especially with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors or inducers, BCRP inhibitors, live attenuated vaccines, and other immune-modulating drugs.
* **Q: How should I store ozanimod?** A: Store ozanimod as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: During the titration period, restart the titration if you miss a dose. After the titration period, take the missed dose as soon as possible, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q:  Are there long-term effects of ozanimod?** A: Long-term studies are ongoing. Discuss potential long-term effects and risks with your doctor.
* **Q: When should I contact my doctor?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe dizziness, or signs of infection.
