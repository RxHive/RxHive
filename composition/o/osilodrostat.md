# Osilodrostat
### Generic Name
Osilodrostat

### Usage

Osilodrostat is a medication used to treat Cushing's disease in adults.  Cushing's disease is a rare disorder caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland that produces excess cortisol. This excess cortisol leads to a range of symptoms, including weight gain, high blood pressure, muscle weakness, and mood changes. Osilodrostat is prescribed for adults when pituitary surgery isn't an option or hasn't been successful in controlling the excess cortisol production.  It's a targeted therapy, specifically inhibiting the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The recommended starting dose of osilodrostat is 2 mg twice daily (BID).  It's crucial to correct any existing hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypomagnesemia (low magnesium) before starting treatment. A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained, and another within a week of starting treatment, with further ECGs as clinically indicated.

Dosage adjustments are made based on cortisol levels and the patient's response.  The dose is titrated upwards by 1-2 mg BID (not more often than every two weeks) until adequate control of cortisol levels is achieved.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 30 mg, but this is reached through careful titration. Cortisol levels are monitored frequently (at least two 24-hour urinary free cortisol measurements every 1-2 weeks initially), and then less frequently once a stable dose is established.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with liver problems.  Those with mild impairment require no adjustment, while those with moderate impairment should start at 1 mg BID, and those with severe impairment should start at 1 mg once daily (OD) in the evening.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with kidney problems, but caution is advised when interpreting urinary free cortisol levels due to reduced excretion in those with moderate to severe impairment.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of osilodrostat in children have not been established.

### Side Effects

Osilodrostat can cause various side effects, ranging from common to less frequent but more serious.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about any new symptoms that develop.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 20% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Nausea
* Edema (swelling)
* Adrenocortical insufficiency (low cortisol levels)


**Other Side Effects (occurring in varying percentages):**

* Dizziness
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Abdominal pain
* Decreased appetite
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Altered hormone levels (including increased corticotrophin, decreased cortisol, increased testosterone)
* Hirsutism (excessive hair growth)
* Hypokalemia (low potassium)
* Acne
* Skin rash
* Benign neoplasm (tumor) changes
* Urinary tract infection
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Fever
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Insomnia
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Prolonged QT interval on ECG
* Syncope (fainting)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Gastroenteritis (stomach flu)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Anemia
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Increased liver enzymes


**Serious Side Effects:** Adrenal insufficiency is a serious side effect that can be life-threatening.  Symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, and weakness.  QTc prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality) is another serious concern.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works

Osilodrostat works by inhibiting the 11 beta-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP11B1). This enzyme is responsible for the final step in the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands. By blocking this enzyme, osilodrostat reduces the amount of cortisol produced, helping to control the symptoms of Cushing's disease.

### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Osilodrostat's metabolism can be affected by other drugs.  CYP3A4 inhibitors (like itraconazole and clarithromycin) can increase osilodrostat levels, while CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducers (like carbamazepine, rifampin, and phenobarbital) can decrease them.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting osilodrostat.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Osilodrostat's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  It is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

* **QTc Prolongation:** Osilodrostat may prolong the QTc interval on an ECG, increasing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. This risk is higher in patients with existing heart conditions or those taking other medications that can prolong the QTc interval.

* **Adrenal Insufficiency:**  A significant risk of adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol) exists. Regular monitoring of cortisol levels and prompt treatment with glucocorticoids if needed are essential.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with liver or kidney problems.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take osilodrostat with food?**  A: Yes, osilodrostat can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How is my progress monitored while taking osilodrostat?** A: Your doctor will monitor your cortisol levels (using urine tests and potentially others) and your overall health.  Regular blood tests to monitor electrolytes (potassium and magnesium) and blood pressure checks are also part of the monitoring process.

* **Q: What are the signs of adrenal insufficiency, and what should I do if I experience them?** A: Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure, and low blood sugar.  If you experience these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.  This is a serious side effect requiring prompt medical attention.

* **Q: How long will I need to take osilodrostat?** A: The duration of treatment will depend on your individual response and clinical course.  It's a long-term treatment for most individuals.

* **Q: Can I stop taking osilodrostat suddenly?** A: No, do not stop taking osilodrostat without first consulting your doctor. Stopping suddenly can lead to adrenal insufficiency.  Any changes to your dosage must be made under the supervision of your doctor.
