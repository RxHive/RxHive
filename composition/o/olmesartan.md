# Olmesartan
### Generic Name
Olmesartan

### Usage

Olmesartan is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It can be used alone or in combination with other blood pressure-lowering medications.  Its main mechanism is to relax blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily, thus reducing blood pressure.  Olmesartan is also sometimes used off-label in the management of acute coronary syndrome (specifically non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), both diabetic and non-diabetic.  However, its use in these conditions requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The starting dose for hypertension is typically 20 mg once daily. After two weeks, this can be increased to a maximum of 40 mg once daily if blood pressure isn't adequately controlled. For acute coronary syndrome, the initial dose is also 20 mg once daily, gradually increasing to 40 mg/day as tolerated under close medical supervision to avoid dangerously low blood pressure.  For proteinuric CKD, the starting dose is 20 mg once daily, with potential increases to 40 mg daily based on response and tolerability, aiming for blood pressure and proteinuria goals set by the healthcare provider.  Olmesartan is available in tablet form.

**Children and Adolescents (6-16 years):**  Dosage is determined by weight.  For those weighing 20 to less than 35 kg, the starting dose is 10 mg once daily, potentially increasing to a maximum of 20 mg daily if needed. For those weighing 35 kg or more, the starting dose is 20 mg once daily, potentially increasing to a maximum of 40 mg daily.  Olmesartan should not be given to children under 1 year of age.  

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For patients with mild hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is usually needed.  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment may require careful monitoring and potentially lower doses. For renal impairment, adjustments may be necessary depending on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  A healthcare professional should guide dosage decisions based on individual patient factors.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Diarrhea
* Back pain
* Upper respiratory infections (like bronchitis, sinusitis, etc.)
* Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)
* Hypertriglyceridemia (high triglycerides)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Acute renal failure
* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
* Liver enzyme elevation

If any adverse effects occur,  it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II is a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict, raising blood pressure. Olmesartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, preventing blood vessel constriction and promoting vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), thus lowering blood pressure. It also reduces aldosterone secretion, further contributing to blood pressure control.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Olmesartan is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to olmesartan or any component of the formulation. It's also contraindicated in patients with diabetes and moderate-to-severe renal impairment concurrently using aliskiren.

**Interactions:** Olmesartan can interact with various medications, including ACE inhibitors, other antihypertensives, NSAIDs, potassium supplements, and potassium-sparing diuretics. These interactions may increase the risk of low blood pressure, hyperkalemia, or other adverse effects. Consult a doctor about all medications and supplements taken before starting Olmesartan.

**Warnings:** Olmesartan is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus. It should be avoided in women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.  It's also important to use caution in patients with impaired kidney or liver function, pre-existing heart conditions, or volume depletion.  


### FAQs

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Olmesartan?**  A: It's best to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while on Olmesartan, as alcohol can worsen its hypotensive effects, potentially causing dizziness or fainting.

**Q: How should I store Olmesartan?** A: Store Olmesartan tablets in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as per the instructions on the packaging.

**Q: Can I stop taking Olmesartan suddenly?** A: No, you should not stop taking Olmesartan abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Your doctor will guide you on a safe tapering schedule, if necessary.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: Is Olmesartan safe for older adults?** A: Olmesartan can be used in older adults, but caution is necessary due to their increased sensitivity to side effects and the possible need for dosage adjustments.  A physician should closely monitor these patients.
