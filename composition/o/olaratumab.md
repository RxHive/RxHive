# Olaratumab
### Generic Name
Olaratumab

### Usage
Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-α), was previously used in combination with doxorubicin for treating adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma.  This treatment was specifically for sarcomas where an anthracycline-containing regimen was appropriate and curative treatment via radiotherapy or surgery wasn't feasible.  However, it's crucial to note that **olaratumab is no longer marketed and is withdrawn from the market**.  Its use is now limited to participation in ongoing clinical trials.


### Dosage
Because Olaratumab is no longer commercially available, specific dosage information is not relevant for general use.  Any dosage information should only come from a researcher involved in an ongoing clinical trial.  Previous clinical trials used various dosing regimens, and these should not be followed outside a controlled clinical setting.

### Side Effects
Since Olaratumab is no longer available, the following side effects are for informational purposes only, based on previous clinical data, and should not be interpreted as a comprehensive list applicable to current situations.

* **Common Side Effects:**  Fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, constipation, hair loss, peripheral neuropathy, mouth sores, hypertension, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia.
* **Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Severe allergic reactions, heart problems, bleeding, infections.

**It is essential to consult a healthcare professional immediately if any adverse effects occur.**


### How it Works
Olaratumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to PDGFR-α.  By binding to this receptor, it blocks the binding of platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) like PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and PDGF-CC. This prevents the activation of the receptor and disrupts the downstream signaling pathways that are important for sarcoma cell growth, proliferation, and the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).  In essence, it interferes with the sarcoma's ability to grow and spread.


### Precautions
Because Olaratumab is withdrawn from the market, the following precautions are for informational purposes only, derived from previous clinical data and should not be applied in the current context.

* **Contraindications:**  Specific contraindications would have been listed in the original prescribing information, but are unavailable due to the drug's withdrawal.
* **Drug Interactions:** Interactions with other medications were likely present, but are not detailed here because the drug is no longer available.
* **Specific Populations:**  Precautions for pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly were previously outlined in the prescribing information but are now inaccessible.

**Given that the drug is no longer available, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for any questions or concerns about drug interactions or safety in specific populations.**
