# Oxymorphone
### Generic Name
Oxymorphone

### Usage

Oxymorphone is a powerful opioid pain medication used to manage severe pain when other treatments haven't been effective.  Its primary use is for chronic pain requiring around-the-clock opioid treatment.  It's also used for:

* **Acute pain:**  Short-term, intense pain requiring strong opioid relief.
* **Preoperative medication:** To reduce anxiety and pain before surgery.
* **Anesthesia support:** During surgical procedures to enhance the effects of other anesthetics.
* **Labor analgesia:** To manage pain during childbirth (administered by injection).
* **Relief of anxiety in patients with dyspnea:** Short-term use to alleviate shortness of breath associated with pulmonary edema.

It's crucial to understand that oxymorphone should only be used when other pain management options, such as non-opioid analgesics or combination opioid products, prove insufficient or cause intolerable side effects.


### Dosage

Oxymorphone dosages are highly individualized and depend on several factors including the patient's age, weight, overall health, pain severity, and tolerance to opioids (whether they've used opioids before).  It's available in different forms (oral immediate-release tablets, oral extended-release tablets, and injectable solutions).  A physician must determine the appropriate dose and regimen.  The following are general guidelines only and should not be interpreted as recommendations for self-medication:


**Adults:**

* **Chronic Pain (Oral Extended-Release):**  Typically starts at a low dose (e.g., 5 mg every 12 hours) and is gradually increased as needed under medical supervision.  The dose is adjusted based on pain control and side effects.  Important note:  Extended-release tablets should be swallowed whole; never crushed, chewed, or dissolved.

* **Acute Pain (Oral Immediate-Release):** Initial doses usually range from 5-10 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.

* **Injectable (IM, SubQ, IV):**  Dosage and frequency vary significantly depending on the specific indication and patient factors. Always administered under close medical supervision.

**Children:**

Oxymorphone's safety and effectiveness haven't been established in children under 18 years old. It should not be used in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Renal or hepatic impairment requires careful dose adjustments and close monitoring by a doctor. In some cases, oxymorphone may be contraindicated altogether in patients with moderate to severe liver or kidney disease.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Headache
* Itching (pruritus)
* Vomiting

Less common but more serious side effects:

* Severe constipation leading to bowel obstruction
* Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Allergic reactions
* Addictive potential


**If you experience any adverse effects, especially respiratory difficulties or severe allergic reactions, contact your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Oxymorphone is an opioid agonist, meaning it binds to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord.  This interaction reduces the perception of pain signals and produces analgesia (pain relief).  Oxymorphone primarily targets mu-opioid receptors, but at higher doses it may also interact with other opioid receptors. The exact mechanisms by which it achieves pain relief are still under investigation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Oxymorphone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or other similar opioids, severe respiratory depression, acute or severe asthma, paralytic ileus (bowel obstruction), or moderate to severe liver impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Oxymorphone can interact with several drugs, including other CNS depressants (like alcohol, benzodiazepines, and sedatives), leading to increased sedation and respiratory depression. It can also interact with certain antidepressants, anticonvulsants and other medications.  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you're taking.

* **Special Populations:**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, older adults, and individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g., kidney or liver disease, respiratory problems, seizure disorders) require special caution and careful monitoring while taking oxymorphone.


* **Addiction:** Oxymorphone is an opioid with a high potential for addiction, abuse, and misuse.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take oxymorphone with alcohol?**
    * A: No. Combining oxymorphone and alcohol can significantly increase the risk of respiratory depression and overdose, potentially leading to death.

* **Q: How should I store oxymorphone?**
    * A: Store oxymorphone at room temperature, away from moisture and heat, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
    * A:  Do not double the dose. Contact your physician for advice if a dose is missed.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking oxymorphone suddenly?**
    * A: No. Abruptly stopping oxymorphone can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always taper off under the supervision of your doctor.

* **Q: What are the long-term risks of oxymorphone use?**
    * A: Long-term risks include addiction, tolerance (needing higher doses for the same effect), withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, and other adverse effects.
