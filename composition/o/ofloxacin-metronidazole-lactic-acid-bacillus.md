# Ofloxacin + Metronidazole + Lactic acid bacillus
### Generic Name
Ofloxacin + Metronidazole + Lactic acid bacillus


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to treat bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly those involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  The specific infections it targets often involve a mixed infection, meaning multiple types of bacteria are causing the problem. Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against a broad range of aerobic bacteria (bacteria that need oxygen to survive). Metronidazole targets anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that thrive without oxygen) and some protozoa (single-celled organisms).  Lactic acid bacillus is a probiotic, beneficial bacteria that helps restore the balance of the gut flora after the antibiotics have eliminated the harmful bacteria.  This combination is often prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Infectious diarrhea:** Caused by a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
* **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exacerbations:**  In some cases, it may be used as an adjunct therapy to control secondary bacterial infections during IBD flares.  (Note: this is not a primary treatment for IBD itself).
* **Post-antibiotic diarrhea:** To help restore gut flora after a course of antibiotics that may have disrupted the normal gut microbiome.


It's crucial to understand that this combination should only be used under the strict guidance of a physician.  It's not a suitable treatment for all gastrointestinal infections.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific infection, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.  There is no standard, universally accepted dosage for this combination, as formulations differ and are usually compounded specifically.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose and duration of treatment based on individual needs.  **Never attempt to self-medicate or alter dosages without consulting a healthcare professional.**

**Generally, dosage information for the individual components (if given separately) would be:**

* **Ofloxacin:**  Dosage varies widely depending on the route of administration (oral or intravenous) and the specific infection.  Oral dosages range from 200mg to 800mg daily, divided into doses. Intravenous dosages follow a similar pattern but are administered by a healthcare professional.

* **Metronidazole:**  Dosage also varies widely by route and infection, ranging from 250mg to 500mg orally multiple times daily. Intravenous administration is common for severe infections.

* **Lactic acid bacillus:** Dosage for probiotics depends on the specific strain and product used.  Follow the product instructions carefully.

**It's imperative to consult a prescribing physician for accurate dosage information for this specific combination.**


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.
* **Headache:**  
* **Dizziness:**
* **Rash:**
* **Vaginal yeast infection (in women):** Due to disruption of normal vaginal flora.


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but can be life-threatening.
* **Clostridium difficile infection:**  Antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by *C. difficile*, a bacterium resistant to many antibiotics.  This is a serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Central nervous system effects:**  Confusion, seizures, hallucinations (more common with metronidazole at higher doses).
* **Blood disorders:**  These are rare but can be serious.

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or concerning side effects.**


### How it Works

This combination works synergistically.  Ofloxacin targets and kills a wide range of aerobic bacteria causing the infection.  Metronidazole works against anaerobic bacteria, often present alongside aerobic ones in gut infections. Together, they provide broad-spectrum coverage against various bacterial species causing the infection.  The lactic acid bacillus probiotic helps restore the normal gut bacterial balance, counteracting the disruption caused by the antibiotics and preventing potential complications such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This promotes faster recovery and reduces the risk of recurring infections.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  This medication should not be used if you have a known allergy to any of its components (ofloxacin, metronidazole, or any of the probiotic components).
* **Drug interactions:**  This medication can interact with several other drugs. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Liver and kidney disease:**  Patients with liver or kidney problems may require dosage adjustments or close monitoring.
* **Children:**  Use in children requires careful consideration and precise dosage adjustments based on age and weight.
* **Elderly:**  The elderly may be more susceptible to side effects.
* **Photosensitivity:**  Ofloxacin may increase sensitivity to sunlight.  Avoid prolonged sun exposure and use sunscreen.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the infection's severity and the individual's response.  Improvement is usually noticeable within a few days.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: No.  Metronidazole interacts negatively with alcohol, causing unpleasant and potentially harmful side effects.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist.  Typically, this would be at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication early if I feel better?** A: No.  Complete the entire course of treatment, even if you feel better, to prevent the infection from returning or developing antibiotic resistance.
