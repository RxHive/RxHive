# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Indapamide

**Generic Name:** Olmesartan Medoxomil/Indapamide

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  Olmesartan medomxil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic.  By working together, they lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone.  This combination is typically prescribed when blood pressure is not adequately controlled with a single medication.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Olmesartan Medoxomil/Indapamide can cause side effects, though not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Headache:** A frequent side effect, often mild and transient.
* **Dizziness:** Can be due to blood pressure lowering effects.  Important to rise slowly from sitting or lying positions.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, causing dizziness or lightheadedness.
* **Muscle cramps:** Often associated with the diuretic effect.
* **Dry cough:** Less common than with ACE inhibitors, but still possible.
* **Constipation:**  A potential side effect, especially in those prone to constipation.
* **Low potassium levels (hypokalemia):**  Indapamide can cause this, potentially leading to muscle weakness or irregular heartbeat.  Regular blood tests may be necessary.


**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention:**  These include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms like rash, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Signs of kidney problems:**  Decreased urine output, swelling in legs and feet.
* **Symptoms of low blood pressure (hypotension):**  Severe dizziness, fainting.
* **Signs of dehydration:** Excessive thirst, dry mouth.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):** Muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat.
* **Liver problems:** Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), abdominal pain.
* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):** Severe abdominal pain.


This is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences can vary.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list and for advice on managing any side effects.


**How it Works:**

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil:** Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure.
* **Indapamide:**  Increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys. This reduces blood volume, which in turn lowers blood pressure.  The combination of these two mechanisms provides a synergistic effect in lowering blood pressure.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  You must inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some interactions are possible, especially with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and lithium.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects.  Limit or avoid alcohol consumption.
* **What if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to see the full effect on blood pressure.
* **Should I avoid certain foods?**  A diet low in sodium is recommended to enhance the effectiveness of this medication.
* **When should I contact my doctor?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects or if your blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite taking this medication. Regular blood pressure monitoring and potassium level checks are typically recommended.
