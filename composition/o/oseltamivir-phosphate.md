# Oseltamivir Phosphate
### Generic Name
Oseltamivir Phosphate

### Usage
Oseltamivir phosphate is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat and prevent influenza (flu) infections caused by influenza A and B viruses.  Its primary use is to shorten the duration and severity of flu symptoms when started within 48 hours of symptom onset.  While not a cure for the flu, it can significantly reduce the time you're sick and lessen the intensity of symptoms like fever, cough, and body aches.  It's also used for prophylaxis (prevention) in individuals at high risk of complications from influenza, such as those with weakened immune systems or chronic health conditions, or during influenza outbreaks.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the age, weight, and health condition of the patient, as well as whether it's being used for treatment or prevention.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.  Generally:

**Oral Administration (Capsules and Suspension/Liquid):**

* **Adults and adolescents (13 years and older):**  75 mg twice daily for 5 days (treatment) or as directed for prevention.
* **Children (1 year and older):** Dosage is weight-based and usually calculated by a healthcare professional. The suspension form is often preferred for children.  A pharmacist can help with accurate dosing based on your childâ€™s weight.

**Intravenous (IV) Administration:**

* **Adults and adolescents (13 years and older):**  15 mg/kg given as a single dose, then 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours for up to 5 days.  IV administration is typically reserved for patients who are unable to take oral medication.
* **Pediatric IV dosing:** Specific dosages for children will be determined by a physician based on weight and clinical situation.

**Important Note:**  The precise dosage and duration of treatment should always be determined by a healthcare professional, taking into account the individual's specific needs and circumstances.  Never alter the prescribed dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Cough

Less common, but more serious, side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe abdominal pain
* Changes in behavior or mental state
* Seizures

If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Oseltamivir phosphate is a neuraminidase inhibitor.  Neuraminidase is an enzyme found on the surface of influenza viruses. This enzyme helps the virus to spread from one infected cell to another.  By inhibiting neuraminidase, oseltamivir phosphate prevents the virus from replicating and spreading effectively within the body, reducing the severity and duration of the illness.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not take oseltamivir phosphate if you have a known allergy to the medication or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions may occur.
* **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:**  Discuss the risks and benefits of using oseltamivir phosphate with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with kidney problems may require dose adjustments.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.
* **Neuropsychiatric Events:**  Rarely, oseltamivir phosphate has been associated with neuropsychiatric events, particularly in children and adolescents.  Monitor for any changes in behavior or mental state.
