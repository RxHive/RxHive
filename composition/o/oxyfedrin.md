# Oxyfedrin
### Generic Name
Oxyfedrin

### Usage
Oxyfedrin is primarily used as an antianginal agent in the treatment of angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart) and myocardial infarction (heart attack).  It's employed to manage the symptoms associated with these conditions by improving blood flow to the heart muscle.

### Dosage
The typical adult oral dosage for myocardial infarction and angina pectoris is 8-24 mg three times a day (TID).  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specifically detailed in standard prescribing information; however, caution is advised in patients with these conditions.  Specific pediatric dosing information is not provided; therefore, it should only be used in children under strict medical supervision.  The medication is administered orally (by mouth).

### Side Effects
A common side effect reported is altered taste. While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  It's crucial to contact a healthcare professional immediately if any adverse effects occur.  A complete list of potential side effects should be obtained from your physician or pharmacist and reviewed prior to beginning treatment.


### How it Works
Oxyfedrin acts as a partial agonist at beta-adrenergic receptors.  In simpler terms, it interacts with specific receptors in the body to cause blood vessels in the heart to widen (dilate). This dilation improves blood flow to the heart muscle, reducing chest pain and improving overall heart function, without significantly increasing the heart's oxygen demand.

### Precautions
Oxyfedrin is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to oxyfedrin, aortic insufficiency with significant hemodynamic changes, and subvalvular aortic stenosis.  It should be used cautiously in patients with a history of cardiac disease and in those with hepatic or renal impairment.  Further, it's categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under the guidance of a healthcare provider.  The manufacturer advises against alcohol consumption during treatment.
