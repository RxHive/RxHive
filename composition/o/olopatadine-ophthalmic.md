# Olopatadine (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Olopatadine (Ophthalmic)

### Usage

Olopatadine ophthalmic solution is primarily used to relieve the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the scleraâ€”the white part of the eye).  Allergic conjunctivitis is often caused by allergens like pollen, pet dander, or dust mites.  The medication targets the allergic reaction itself, reducing the itchiness rather than simply masking the symptom.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the concentration of the olopatadine solution:

* **0.1% solution:**  For adults and children aged 3 years and older with allergic conjunctivitis, the typical dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily, every 6 to 8 hours.

* **0.2% solution:** For adults and children aged 2 years and older with allergic conjunctivitis, the usual dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily.

* **0.7% solution:** For adults and children aged 2 years and older with allergic conjunctivitis, the usual dose is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily.


**Important Administration Guidelines:**

* Always wash your hands before applying the medication.
* Avoid touching the tip of the container to your eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.
* If you are using other eye drops, wait at least 5 minutes between applications.
* Remove contact lenses before applying olopatadine and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them.  If your eyes are red, avoid wearing contact lenses.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 1% of patients):**

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those listed as serious, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Olopatadine is a dual-action medication. It works by:

1. **Mast Cell Stabilization:** It prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from mast cells in the conjunctiva.  Mast cells are involved in the allergic response, and preventing the release of these substances reduces the inflammatory reaction and associated itching.

2. **Histamine H1 Antagonism:** It also blocks the action of histamine at its H1 receptor sites.  Histamine, when released during an allergic reaction, binds to these receptors and triggers the symptoms of allergy, including itching.  By blocking histamine's action, olopatadine further reduces itching and inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Olopatadine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to olopatadine or any components of the formulation.  It should not be used to treat contact lens-related irritation.

* **Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions are currently known. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, that you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Olopatadine is classified as category C in pregnancy. This means that the risks to the developing fetus are not fully understood.  The excretion of olopatadine in breast milk is unknown; caution should be exercised if using it while breastfeeding.

* **Special Populations:**  Use in children under the specified age for each concentration should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Older adults may be more sensitive to side effects.


* **Other Precautions:**  Use only as directed. Avoid driving or operating machinery if blurred vision or drowsiness occur. Discontinue use and contact your doctor if your eye condition worsens or persists for more than 3 days, or if you experience eye pain, changes in vision, or increased redness or irritation.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of action can vary, but many people experience relief from itching within a short time after application.

* **Q: Can I use it with other eye drops?** A:  Yes, but wait at least 5 minutes between applications to avoid dilution and to allow for absorption.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store olopatadine at room temperature, away from direct light and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I wear contact lenses while using this medication?** A: Remove your contact lenses before using the medication. You can reinsert them 10 minutes afterward unless your eyes are red, in which case you should avoid contact lenses.
