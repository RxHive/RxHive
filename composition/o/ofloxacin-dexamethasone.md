# Ofloxacin + Dexamethasone

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Dexamethasone

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat bacterial eye infections that respond to ofloxacin, often accompanied by inflammation.  It's typically prescribed for conditions like bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye), keratitis (corneal infection), and other bacterial infections of the eye's surface.  The ofloxacin component fights the bacteria, while the dexamethasone reduces inflammation and swelling.  **It's crucial to only use this medication as prescribed by a doctor; it is not suitable for all types of eye infections, and using it incorrectly can worsen the condition.**

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* Burning, stinging, or itching in the eye
* Temporary blurry vision
* Eye redness or irritation
* Headache
* Eye discharge

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Increased eye pressure (especially in individuals with glaucoma)
* Development of fungal or viral infections (due to suppression of the immune response by dexamethasone)
* Eye pain
* Changes in vision


**How it Works:**

* **Ofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting the activity of bacterial enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) that are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By blocking these enzymes, ofloxacin stops the bacteria from multiplying and eventually kills them.

* **Dexamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation by decreasing the release of inflammatory substances. This helps to lessen swelling, redness, and pain associated with the infection.  The combination of an antibiotic and a steroid provides both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action, leading to faster healing and symptom relief.
