# Oxymetholone
### Generic Name
Oxymetholone

### Usage
Oxymetholone is a synthetic anabolic steroid primarily used to treat anemia resulting from insufficient red blood cell production (decreased erythropoiesis).  This includes conditions like acquired aplastic anemia, congenital anemia, myelofibrosis, and hypoplastic anemia caused by myelotoxic drugs.  It's crucial to understand that Oxymetholone is not a first-line treatment for anemia; it's reserved for cases where other treatments have been ineffective or are unsuitable.

### Dosage
Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the patient's condition and response to treatment.  It's always determined and monitored by a healthcare professional.

**Adults:** For anemia due to deficient red blood cell production, the oral dose typically ranges from 1-5 mg/kg daily for 3-6 months.  The usual effective dose is 1-2 mg/kg/day, but higher doses may be necessary.  After remission, some patients may not need continuous treatment, while others may require lower maintenance doses.

**Children:** The dosage for children is the same as for adults, determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, however, it's contraindicated in cases of severe hepatic impairment.  No adjustments are given for renal impairment, but caution is warranted due to the increased risk of edema.

### Side Effects
Oxymetholone can cause various side effects, ranging from common to rare and serious.  It's vital to report any concerning symptoms to a doctor immediately.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Acne
* Changes in libido
* Hair growth changes (hirsutism in women,  androgenic alopecia in men and women)
* Edema (swelling)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Liver damage (including peliosis hepatis, liver cell tumors, and jaundice)
* Blood clot abnormalities
* Changes in blood lipids (increased risk of atherosclerosis)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium)
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)
* Virilization in females (development of male characteristics)
* Premature closure of epiphyseal plates in children (affecting bone growth)


### How it Works
Oxymetholone works by stimulating the production and excretion of erythropoietin, a hormone that plays a crucial role in red blood cell production. This stimulation enhances erythropoiesis (red blood cell formation) in individuals with bone marrow failure or other conditions leading to insufficient red blood cell production.

### Precautions
Several precautions must be taken when considering Oxymetholone:

* **Contraindications:** Oxymetholone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, breast cancer (in men or women with hypercalcemia), prostate cancer, severe liver dysfunction, nephrosis or nephrotic-phase nephritis, and pregnancy.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Oxymetholone is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to the fetus. It's contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Oxymetholone can interact with several medications, including those affecting blood glucose, anticoagulants, and certain immunosuppressants.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Vulnerable Populations:**  Children, older adults, and individuals with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, or other health conditions require close monitoring while taking Oxymetholone.  Children may experience premature epiphyseal closure.
