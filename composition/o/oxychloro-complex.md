# Oxychloro Complex
### Generic Name
Oxychloro Complex

### Usage

Oxychloro Complex is not a standalone medication used to treat specific medical conditions. Instead, it's a preservative system found in some ophthalmic (eye) formulations, primarily in multi-dose eye drops designed for treating conditions like dry eye disease and glaucoma.  Its primary function isn't therapeutic; it's to prevent microbial contamination and maintain the sterility of the eye drops over their shelf life and after opening.  It's crucial to understand that Oxychloro Complex itself doesn't treat the underlying eye condition; it only helps preserve the active medication within the eye drops.

### Dosage

There is no dosage of Oxychloro Complex as a standalone medication.  The concentration of Oxychloro Complex in eye drop formulations varies depending on the specific product.  The dosage and application instructions are always determined by and provided on the packaging of the specific eye drop product containing Oxychloro Complex, and should be followed precisely.  Consult the product label and/or your physician for the correct dosage and administration details.


### Side Effects

Because Oxychloro Complex is a preservative and not a therapeutic drug, side effects are typically related to its presence in eye drop formulations rather than directly caused by the complex itself. Some users might experience:

* Mild stinging or burning sensation upon application.
* Transient eye irritation.
* Allergic reactions in sensitive individuals (rare).

Serious side effects are rare. If you experience any concerning side effects, such as persistent irritation, severe allergic reaction (swelling, difficulty breathing), or changes in vision, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Oxychloro Complex, specifically the Stabilized Oxychloro Complex (SOC) form, acts as a preservative by releasing chlorine dioxide free radicals when dissolved in solution. These free radicals have strong oxidizing properties, effectively killing bacteria and viruses that might contaminate the eye drop solution.  Once in the eye, SOC breaks down into harmless components: sodium and chloride ions, oxygen, and water.  This ensures the eye drops remain sterile, protecting the active medication from contamination and maintaining the product's efficacy.

### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to chlorite, chlorate, or chlorine dioxide should exercise caution and consult their physician before using eye drops containing Oxychloro Complex.
* **Contact Lens Wear:**  Check the product label for compatibility with contact lenses.  Some formulations may require removing contact lenses before application.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  If pregnant or breastfeeding, consult your doctor before using eye drops containing this preservative, although the systemic absorption of Oxychloro Complex from ophthalmic formulations is generally considered minimal.
* **Other Medications:**  While generally not expected to interact with other medications, inform your healthcare provider of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Children:** Use only as directed by a physician, particularly in children.
* **Storage:** Follow the storage instructions provided on the specific eye drop packaging to maintain the efficacy and sterility of the product.
