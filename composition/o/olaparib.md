# Olaparib
### Generic Name
Olaparib

### Usage

Olaparib is a type of cancer medicine called a PARP inhibitor.  It's used to treat several types of cancer, primarily those with specific genetic mutations that make them vulnerable to this drug.  The primary uses include:

* **Metastatic breast cancer:** Olaparib is approved for treating metastatic (spread to other parts of the body) breast cancer that is HER2-negative (doesn't have too much of the HER2 protein) and has a germline BRCA mutation (a genetic change inherited from a parent).

* **High-risk early breast cancer:**  It's also used for high-risk early breast cancer (cancer that hasn't spread yet but has a high chance of recurrence) that is HER2-negative and has a germline BRCA mutation.

* **Ovarian cancer:** Olaparib treats advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer.  Approval depends on whether the cancer has a BRCA mutation or is homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-positive (meaning it has difficulty repairing damaged DNA).  It's used both as a single treatment and in combination with other medications.

* **Metastatic pancreatic cancer:** Olaparib is indicated for metastatic pancreatic cancer with a germline BRCA mutation.

* **Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer:** It's approved for treating metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer with mutations in homologous recombination repair genes.


### Dosage

Olaparib is typically administered orally (as a tablet) twice daily (BID).  The standard adult dose is 300 mg BID.  However, the specific dosage and duration of treatment vary significantly based on the type and stage of cancer, and whether it's used alone or in combination therapy.  Detailed dosage information should be determined by an oncologist considering individual patient factors.  The following examples illustrate the range of usage:

* **Breast Cancer (Metastatic and High-Risk Early):** 300 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Treatment duration differs between metastatic and high-risk early cancer.

* **Ovarian Cancer (Advanced and Recurrent):** 300 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Maintenance therapy can extend to 2 years, depending on response.

* **Pancreatic Cancer (Metastatic):** 300 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

* **Prostate Cancer (Metastatic, Castration-Resistant):** 300 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  Concomitant use with certain other medications can also require dose modification to avoid drug interactions.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for guidance on dosage and administration.  Pediatric use hasn't been established.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite
* Peripheral edema
* Anemia
* Low white blood cell count (neutropenia)
* Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
* Increased MCV (mean corpuscular volume)


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Peripheral neuropathy
* Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
* Pneumonitis (lung inflammation)
* Venous thromboembolic events (blood clots)

If any concerning side effects develop, it's crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Olaparib works by inhibiting PARP enzymes, which are involved in DNA repair. Cancer cells, particularly those with BRCA mutations or HRD, are already deficient in their DNA repair mechanisms.  By further inhibiting PARP, Olaparib causes significant DNA damage in these cells, leading to cell death and tumor shrinkage. This is known as synthetic lethalityâ€”the combination of two defects (BRCA mutation and PARP inhibition) resulting in cell death, even though neither defect alone would be lethal.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  No specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer.  However, careful consideration should be given to individual patient health conditions.

* **Drug Interactions:** Olaparib can interact with other medications, especially those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers should be avoided or managed with dose adjustments.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential drug interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Olaparib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose.  Men should use contraception during treatment and for 3 months after treatment.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for one month after the final dose.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with moderate to severe kidney or liver impairment.

* **Monitoring:** Regular blood tests to monitor blood counts and kidney function are essential during treatment with Olaparib.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Olaparib stored?** A: Olaparib should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Olaparib?** A:  Consult your doctor. Alcohol can worsen some side effects like nausea.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How long will I need to take Olaparib?** A: Treatment duration varies depending on your cancer type, stage, response to treatment, and any side effects experienced.  Your oncologist will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q:  Is Olaparib suitable for everyone with cancer?** A: No. Olaparib's effectiveness is largely dependent on the presence of specific genetic mutations in the cancer cells.  Your oncologist will determine if it's an appropriate treatment option based on your individual circumstances.
