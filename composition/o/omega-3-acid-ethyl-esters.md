# Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters
### Generic Name
Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters

### Usage
Omega-3-acid ethyl esters are primarily used as an adjunct to diet for reducing triglyceride (TG) levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), specifically those with triglyceride levels of 500 mg/dL or higher.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* a standalone treatment; it works best in conjunction with a proper diet and lifestyle modifications.  The medication's effect on the risk of pancreatitis, cardiovascular morbidity, or mortality in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia hasn't been definitively established.

### Dosage
**Adults (Severe Hypertriglyceridemia):** The usual oral dosage is 4 grams per day. This can be taken as a single 4-gram dose (typically four capsules) or divided into two 2-gram doses (two capsules twice daily).  Before starting this medication, triglyceride levels should be carefully assessed, and other potential causes of high triglycerides (like diabetes, hypothyroidism, or other medications) should be identified and addressed.  A lipid-lowering diet should be initiated *before* and continued *throughout* treatment.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Omega-3-acid ethyl esters in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, in patients with liver problems, regular monitoring of serum ALT and AST (liver enzymes) is recommended during treatment.

### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Eructation (belching)
* Taste perversion

**Less Common (Frequency not defined):**
* Constipation
* Other gastrointestinal disorders
* Vomiting
* Increased serum ALT and AST levels (liver enzymes)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Rash

**Post-marketing (rare):**
* Anaphylactic reaction
* Hemorrhagic diathesis (bleeding tendency)
* Urticaria (hives)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
The exact mechanism of how Omega-3-acid ethyl esters lower triglycerides isn't fully understood. However, several potential mechanisms are suggested:  inhibition of an enzyme involved in triglyceride synthesis (acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase), increased breakdown of fats in the liver (mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation), decreased fat production in the liver (lipogenesis), and increased activity of an enzyme that breaks down fats in the blood (lipoprotein lipase).  Essentially, the EPA and DHA in the medication may reduce triglyceride synthesis in the liver because they are poorly used by the enzymes that make triglycerides, and they also inhibit the use of other fatty acids in triglyceride production.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Omega-3-acid ethyl esters are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to the medication or any of its components.

**Increased Risk:**  This medication may increase the risk of frequent recurrences of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter (irregular heartbeat), prolonged bleeding time, increased ALT levels without a corresponding increase in AST levels, and increased LDL cholesterol levels.

**Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish and in breastfeeding women.  The medication may prolong bleeding time, so careful monitoring is needed if it's used concurrently with anticoagulants (blood thinners) or other drugs affecting coagulation (e.g., antiplatelet agents).

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Omega-3-acid ethyl esters without a prescription?** A: No, this medication requires a prescription from a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should I store Omega-3-acid ethyl esters?** A: Store the medication as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's been a full day since the last dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A:  Yes, this medication may interact with anticoagulants and other medications affecting blood clotting.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Q: I have a fish allergy; can I still take this medication?** A:  Use with caution if you have a fish or shellfish allergy. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits.  Although the source is fish oil, the manufacturing process may reduce the allergenic potential, but it cannot be entirely eliminated.

* **Q: Will this medication cure my high triglycerides?** A:  No, it is an adjunct therapy and works best when combined with dietary changes and lifestyle modifications. It helps to lower triglycerides, but it does not address the underlying cause.  A healthy diet and lifestyle are crucial for long-term triglyceride management.
