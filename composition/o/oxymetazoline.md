# Oxymetazoline

**Generic Name:** Oxymetazoline

**Usage:**

Oxymetazoline is a nasal decongestant used to temporarily relieve stuffiness and congestion in the nose caused by the common cold, allergies, or other respiratory illnesses.  It's available as a nasal spray or drops.  It's typically used for short-term relief (no more than 3 days for adults and 5 days for children).  **It should not be used longer than recommended without consulting a doctor.**

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the nose
* Dryness of the nasal passages
* Sneezing
* Headache
*  Drowsiness (less common)

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

*  Fast or irregular heartbeat
*  High blood pressure
*  Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
*  Anxiety
*  Hallucinations (rare, especially in children)
*  Rebound congestion (worsening congestion after stopping use) â€“ This is a common issue if used for extended periods.

**How it Works:**

Oxymetazoline is a sympathomimetic amine. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages. This reduces swelling and inflammation, allowing for easier breathing.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  Oxymetazoline usually starts working within a few minutes of application.

* **How often can I use it?**  Follow the directions on the label carefully.  Overuse can lead to rebound congestion.  Adults generally shouldn't use it more than every 10-12 hours, and children's use should be strictly according to the pediatrician's instructions.

* **Can I use it if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using oxymetazoline if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Can I use it with other medications?**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, before using oxymetazoline.  Interactions are possible, especially with certain heart medications or antidepressants.

* **What should I do if I overdose?**  Contact your doctor or poison control center immediately if you suspect an overdose.

* **What if my symptoms don't improve or worsen?**  See a doctor if your nasal congestion persists for more than a few days, worsens, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, severe headache, or facial pain.
