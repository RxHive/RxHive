# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Metoprolol Succinate

**Generic Name:** Olmesartan Medoxomil + Metoprolol Succinate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines two different types of blood pressure medications: an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) – olmesartan medoxomil – and a beta-blocker – metoprolol succinate.  By working together, they lower blood pressure more effectively than either drug alone. This is often prescribed for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with a single medication.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, headache, and sleep disturbances.
* **Less Common but More Serious:**  Slow heart rate (bradycardia), low blood pressure (hypotension), swelling in the ankles and feet (edema), shortness of breath, cough, and worsening of heart failure.  Rarely, serious allergic reactions (angioedema) can occur, characterized by swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Other Potential Side Effects:**  Changes in liver function, kidney problems, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), particularly in patients with diabetes, and depression.  This is not an exhaustive list, and you should consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil:**  This ARB blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, olmesartan medoxomil causes blood vessels to relax and widen, lowering blood pressure.
* **Metoprolol Succinate:** This beta-blocker works by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of the heart's contractions. This also helps lower blood pressure. The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more comprehensive approach to blood pressure control.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure further, potentially leading to dizziness or fainting.  Limit alcohol consumption or avoid it altogether while taking this medication, especially at the beginning of treatment.  Discuss with your doctor.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping this medication abruptly can lead to a sudden increase in blood pressure and other potentially dangerous effects.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.  If you miss multiple doses consult your doctor.
* **Q:  What are the potential drug interactions?** A: Many drugs can interact with olmesartan medoxomil and metoprolol succinate.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  This includes over-the-counter drugs and nonprescription medications.
* **Q:  Is this medication safe for pregnant women?** A:  Generally, this medication is not recommended during pregnancy. The use of ARBs, especially in the second and third trimesters, can cause fetal injury. Consult with your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking this medication.
* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience signs of a serious allergic reaction (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe dizziness, fainting, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, or severe shortness of breath.
