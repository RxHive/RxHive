# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Metoprolol Succinate
### Generic Name
Olmesartan Medoxomil + Metoprolol Succinate

### Usage

Olmesartan Medoxomil + Metoprolol Succinate is a combination medication used primarily to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It combines two different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs: an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), olmesartan medoxomil, and a beta-blocker, metoprolol succinate.  By working through different mechanisms, this combination offers a synergistic effect, often leading to more effective blood pressure control than either drug alone.  While its primary use is hypertension, it may also be prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke or heart attack, in patients with high blood pressure and other risk factors, particularly those with a history of coronary artery disease.  The decision to prescribe this combination is made based on individual patient needs and risk factors.


### Dosage

Dosage for Olmesartan Medoxomil + Metoprolol Succinate is determined by a healthcare professional and depends on individual patient factors like age, overall health, and response to treatment. It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage regimen strictly.  There is no universally standard dosage; the specific amounts of olmesartan medoxomil and metoprolol succinate in each tablet vary depending on the brand and formulation.  The medication is typically available in oral tablet form.

* **Adults:** The starting dose and subsequent adjustments are tailored by the prescribing physician. It's crucial to follow their specific instructions.  They will monitor blood pressure regularly to fine-tune the dosage for optimal effectiveness and safety.
* **Children:** This combination medication is generally *not* recommended for use in children.  Separate medications might be used to treat high blood pressure in children.
* **Elderly:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients due to potential decreased kidney or liver function.  Careful monitoring by the physician is important.
* **IV Administration:** This combination medication is not available in intravenous (IV) form.  Olmesartan medoxomil and metoprolol succinate are sometimes given intravenously *separately* in specific clinical settings, but not in this combined form.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Cough
* Swelling in ankles or feet

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) - Seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Worsening of heart failure
* Renal impairment (kidney problems)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works

Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the effects of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow. By blocking angiotensin II, olmesartan helps to relax and widen blood vessels, lowering blood pressure.  Metoprolol Succinate is a beta-blocker that works by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of the heart's contractions, thereby lowering blood pressure. The combination of these two actions leads to a more significant and sustained reduction in blood pressure compared to using either drug alone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used by individuals with certain conditions, such as severe heart failure, certain types of heart block, severe bradycardia (slow heart rate), or hypersensitivity to olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate, or any of the inactive ingredients in the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** This medication can interact with other drugs, including other blood pressure medications, diabetes medications, and certain pain relievers.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult with your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits.
* **Elderly:** Elderly patients are at increased risk of side effects and may require lower doses.
* **Kidney and Liver Disease:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for individuals with kidney or liver problems.  Renal function monitoring may be necessary.
