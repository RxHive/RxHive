# Odevixibat
### Generic Name
Odevixibat

### Usage
Odevixibat is primarily used to treat pruritus (severe itching) in patients aged 3 months and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).  PFIC is a group of rare, inherited liver diseases that affect the flow of bile from the liver.  The buildup of bile salts in the body causes significant itching. Odevixibat works by reducing the reabsorption of bile acids in the intestines, thus lowering the amount of bile acids circulating in the body and alleviating the itch.  It's important to note that Odevixibat may not be effective in all PFIC patients, particularly those with specific genetic variations in the *ABCB11* gene affecting the bile salt export pump (BSEP).

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Odevixibat's effectiveness may vary depending on the specific type and genetic characteristics of PFIC.  Consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations.

**Adults and Children (3 months and older):**

Odevixibat is administered orally. The starting dose is generally 40 mcg/kg once daily (OD) in the morning, given with food.

* **Dosage Adjustment:** If there's no improvement in pruritus after three months, the dose may be increased gradually, in increments of 40 mcg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 120 mcg/kg/day or 6 mg/day, whichever is lower.  The dosage may also be adjusted based on a weight-band system for children, as follows:
    * Body weight ≤ 7.4 kg: 200 mcg/day
    * Body weight 7.5–12.4 kg: 400 mcg/day
    * Body weight 12.5–17.4 kg: 600 mcg/day
    * Body weight 17.5–25.4 kg: 800 mcg/day
    * Body weight 25.5–35.4 kg: 1200 mcg/day
    * Body weight 35.5–45.4 kg: 1600 mcg/day
    * Body weight 45.5–55.4 kg: 2000 mcg/day
    * Body weight ≥ 55.5 kg: 2400 mcg/day

**Dosage Adjustments Due to Side Effects:**  If diarrhea or liver enzyme abnormalities occur, the dose may need to be temporarily interrupted or permanently stopped, depending on the severity and response.  Supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins may also be necessary.  Specific adjustments will be determined by a physician.

**Special Populations:**  The safety and effectiveness of Odevixibat in children younger than 3 months of age have not been established.  Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment are not typically required.  For patients with hepatic impairment, careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments are crucial; it's essential to consult with a doctor.  The drug is available in capsule and oral pellet forms. The oral pellets should be sprinkled onto a small amount of soft food and consumed immediately. Capsules should be swallowed whole.



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Increased bilirubin levels
* Vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E)
* Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Cholelithiasis (gallstones)
* Dehydration
* Bone fractures

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly those that are persistent or severe, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Odevixibat is an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor.  It works by blocking the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum (the last part of the small intestine). By preventing this reabsorption, Odevixibat reduces the levels of circulating bile acids in the body.  While the exact mechanism by which this reduces pruritus in PFIC patients isn't fully understood, the reduction in bile acid levels is believed to be a key factor in alleviating the itching associated with the condition.

### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:**  Bile acid-binding resins (e.g., cholestyramine, colesevelam, colestipol) may reduce the effectiveness of Odevixibat.  These should be taken at least 4 hours before or after Odevixibat.
* **Liver Function:** Odevixibat can cause liver enzyme elevations; regular monitoring of liver function tests is necessary.  If significant liver problems develop, the drug may need to be stopped.
* **Fat-Soluble Vitamins:** Odevixibat can lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).  Regular monitoring of vitamin levels and supplementation may be required.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There is limited information on the use of Odevixibat during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before using this medication during these periods. Animal studies suggest potential risks to the developing fetus.
* **Children:**  Odevixibat is not approved for use in children under 3 months old.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I crush or chew the Odevixibat capsules?** A: No, capsules should be swallowed whole. The oral pellets should be sprinkled onto soft food.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose.
* **Q: How should I store Odevixibat?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Is Odevixibat addictive?** A: No, Odevixibat is not considered an addictive medication.
* **Q: What if I experience severe side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience severe or persistent side effects.
