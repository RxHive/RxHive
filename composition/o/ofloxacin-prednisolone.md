# Ofloxacin + Prednisolone

**Generic Name:** Ofloxacin + Prednisolone ophthalmic solution (Often sold under various brand names)

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other bacterial eye infections that respond to both an antibiotic (Ofloxacin) and a steroid (Prednisolone).  The Ofloxacin fights the bacteria, while the Prednisolone reduces inflammation and swelling. It's crucial to note that this combination is **generally not used for viral infections** as the steroid can worsen viral conjunctivitis.  Always consult a doctor to determine the correct usage. The medication is usually applied as eye drops several times a day, as directed by a physician.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary but may include:

* **Eye irritation:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness.
* **Increased intraocular pressure (IOP):**  Can lead to glaucoma if not monitored. Regular eye pressure checks are often necessary during treatment.
* **Eye infections:**  Though the medication treats infection, secondary infections can sometimes occur.
* **Blurred vision:** Temporary blurring may occur immediately after application.
* **Headache:** Less common.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but can include rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing.  Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
* **Thinning of the cornea (with prolonged use):** This is more of a concern with long-term use.
* **Cataracts (with prolonged use):**  Long-term use can increase the risk of cataracts.


**How it Works:**

* **Ofloxacin:** This is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. It works by interfering with the bacterial DNA replication process, ultimately preventing the bacteria from multiplying and causing further infection.
* **Prednisolone:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It reduces inflammation and swelling in the eye by suppressing the body's immune response. This helps to reduce the symptoms of the infection and promote healing.
