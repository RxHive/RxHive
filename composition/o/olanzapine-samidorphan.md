# Olanzapine + Samidorphan
### Generic Name
Olanzapine + Samidorphan

### Usage

Olanzapine and Samidorphan, a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and an opioid antagonist, is primarily used to treat acute mania or acute episodes with mixed features associated with Bipolar I disorder.  It can be used as monotherapy or in conjunction with lithium or valproate.  This combination is also indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* suitable for treating dementia-related psychosis.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Bipolar I Disorder (Acute Mania/Mixed Features):**
    * **Monotherapy:**  The initial oral dose is either 10 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan or 15 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan once daily (OD).  The dose can be adjusted based on response and tolerability, increasing or decreasing in 5mg increments (based on the Olanzapine component) at intervals of at least 24 hours. The maximum dose is 20 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan OD.
    * **Adjunctive Therapy (with Lithium or Valproate):**  The initial oral dose is 10 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan OD. Dose adjustments are made in 5 mg increments (Olanzapine) at weekly intervals, up to a maximum of 20 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan OD.
* **Schizophrenia:**
    * Initial oral dose is 5 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan or 10 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan OD.  Adjustments are made in 5 mg increments (Olanzapine) at weekly intervals, to a maximum of 20 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan OD.

**Important Dosage Considerations:**

* **Opioid Use:**  In patients with recent opioid use, delay starting Olanzapine/Samidorphan for at least 7 days after the last short-acting opioid and 14 days after the last long-acting opioid.
* **Hypotension Risk/Slow Metabolism:**  In patients at higher risk of hypotension, slower Olanzapine metabolism, or increased sensitivity to Olanzapine, start with 5 mg Olanzapine/10 mg Samidorphan OD.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed, but use caution due to increased exposure in patients with moderate impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is usually necessary for mild-to-moderate impairment.  Caution is advised for severe impairment, and use is not recommended for end-stage renal disease.
* **Pediatric Dosage:** Safety and effectiveness haven't been established in children.

**Administration:** The medication is taken orally once daily, with or without food. Do not break or combine tablets of different strengths.

### How it Works

Olanzapine's precise mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but its effectiveness in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is believed to be due to its combined dopamine and serotonin type 2 (5HT2) receptor antagonism.  Samidorphan, an opioid receptor antagonist, works by blocking the effects of opioids at their receptors. The combinationâ€™s exact synergistic effect is still under investigation.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Concomitant use with opioids.
* Patients currently undergoing acute opioid withdrawal.

**Warnings:**

* Increased mortality risk in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (this medication is not approved for this population).
* Increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events, including stroke, in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.
* Risk of severe opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients.
* Risk of life-threatening opioid overdose.
* Potential for neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
* Potential for drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).
* Metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain.
* Risk of tardive dyskinesia.
* Risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope.
* Risk of falls.
* Risk of leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis.
* Risk of esophageal dysmotility and aspiration.
* Risk of seizures.
* Cognitive and motor impairment.
* Body temperature dysregulation.
* Anticholinergic effects.
* Hyperprolactinemia.
* Hyperlipidemia.

**Use with Caution:**

* In patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, urinary retention, or benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* In patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.
* In patients at risk of orthostatic hypotension.
* In patients exposed to strenuous exercise, heat, or dehydration.
* In patients with severe cardiac disease, hemodynamic instability, prior myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, or hypercholesterolemia.
* In patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
* In patients at risk of seizures.
* In patients with urinary retention.

**Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with diazepam, alcohol, or other CNS depressants may potentiate orthostatic hypotension.  Interactions are also possible with anticholinergics, antihypertensives, levodopa, and dopamine agonists.
