# Ondansetron + Omeprazole

**Generic Name:** Ondansetron/Omeprazole (combination product; note that this is not an officially approved fixed-dose combination in all countries.  Availability varies.)

**Usage:**  This combination is *not* a standard, FDA-approved fixed-dose combination in the US or many other countries.  Ondansetron and omeprazole are often prescribed together *separately* to manage nausea and vomiting (often caused by chemotherapy or other medical interventions) *and* to reduce stomach acid production (which can exacerbate nausea or be a side effect of some chemotherapy regimens). The physician would prescribe each medication separately, tailoring the dosage to the individual patient's needs.

Therefore, the usage would be described as follows for the *individual* components:

* **Ondansetron:**  Prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting, particularly those induced by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and postoperative surgery.  It may also be used for other types of nausea and vomiting.
* **Omeprazole:**  Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. It's also used to prevent stomach ulcers caused by NSAIDs.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are listed for each individual component:

* **Ondansetron:**  Common side effects include headache, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, and fatigue.  Less common but more serious side effects can include prolonged QT interval (heart rhythm disturbance), seizures, and serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition).
* **Omeprazole:**  Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation.  Less common but more serious side effects can include bone fractures (with long-term use), vitamin B12 deficiency, *Clostridium difficile* infection (leading to diarrhea), and allergic reactions.

**How it Works:**

* **Ondansetron:**  It blocks the action of serotonin (5-HT3) receptors in the brain and gastrointestinal tract, which are involved in triggering nausea and vomiting.
* **Omeprazole:**  It's a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces the production of stomach acid by blocking the hydrogen/potassium ATPase enzyme in the parietal cells of the stomach lining.
