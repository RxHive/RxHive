# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Azelnidipine
### Generic Name
Olmesartan Medoxomil + Azelnidipine

### Usage
Olmesartan medoxomil + azelnidipine is a combination medication used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  It works by combining two different mechanisms to lower blood pressure effectively. Olmesartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), which works by relaxing blood vessels and allowing blood to flow more easily. Azelnidipine is a calcium channel blocker, which also relaxes blood vessels and slows down the heart rate, further reducing blood pressure.  This combination therapy is often prescribed when a single medication is insufficient to control blood pressure effectively.  While its primary use is in hypertension management, it may also indirectly contribute to reducing the risk of cardiovascular events associated with uncontrolled hypertension, such as stroke and heart attack, although this is not its direct therapeutic goal.


### Dosage
Dosage should always be determined by a healthcare professional and tailored to the individual's needs and response to treatment.  There is no standard, universally applicable dosage.  The medication typically comes in tablet form for oral administration.  A typical starting dose might be one tablet taken once daily, but this can be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on blood pressure readings and individual patient factors.  This medication is not typically available in IV form.   Children should not receive this medication unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a pediatric cardiologist due to a lack of established safety and efficacy data in this population.  Elderly patients may require lower doses due to potential age-related changes in kidney function.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea,  cough.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat),  low blood pressure (hypotension),  kidney problems,  changes in liver function (rare but potentially serious).
* **Important Note:** If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, including swelling, difficulty breathing, or severe dizziness, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.  


### How it Works
This combination medication works through a two-pronged approach to lower blood pressure. Olmesartan medoxomil blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels.  By blocking this hormone, blood vessels relax and widen, allowing blood to flow more easily, reducing blood pressure. Azelnidipine works by blocking the entry of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This also causes relaxation of blood vessels and slows the heart rate, thereby further reducing blood pressure. The combined effect of these two mechanisms provides a more potent and comprehensive blood pressure-lowering effect than either drug alone.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to either olmesartan medoxomil, azelnidipine, or any of the inactive ingredients.  It should also be used cautiously in patients with severe kidney or liver disease.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other drugs, including but not limited to, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, and other blood pressure medications.  Itâ€™s crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy.  Consult your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while taking this medication. It's also important to discuss breastfeeding with your doctor before using this medication as the safety during breastfeeding has not been fully established.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly individuals may require dose adjustments due to potential age-related changes in kidney function.  Careful monitoring is necessary.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden rise in blood pressure, potentially causing serious complications.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A: Excessive alcohol consumption can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of side effects. Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q:  Is this medication safe for everyone?**  A:  While generally safe and effective for many, this medication may not be suitable for everyone.  Individuals with certain pre-existing conditions should discuss its suitability with their doctor before starting treatment.
