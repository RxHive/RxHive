# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Azelnidipine

**Generic Name:** Olmesartan Medoxomil/Azelnidipine

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (olmesartan medoxomil) and a calcium channel blocker (dihydropyridine) (azelnidipine).  By working through different mechanisms, they effectively lower blood pressure.  This combination is often prescribed when a single medication isn't sufficient to control blood pressure.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the specific doses, but common side effects may include:

* **Headache:** A relatively frequent side effect.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be caused by the blood pressure lowering effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nasal congestion:** Stuffiness or runny nose.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Cough:** Less common than with ACE inhibitors, but still possible.
* **Lower extremity edema (swelling):** Swelling in the ankles and feet.
* **Back pain:**
* **Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing):** May lead to dizziness or fainting.


**Serious, but less common side effects require immediate medical attention:**

* **Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat):** This is a serious allergic reaction.
* **Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes):** Indicates liver problems.
* **Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia):**
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives, difficulty breathing.
* **Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels):** Can be particularly dangerous for those with kidney problems.

This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil (ARB):** This blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. By blocking angiotensin II, blood vessels relax and widen, reducing blood pressure.
* **Azelnidipine (Calcium Channel Blocker):** This relaxes the muscles in the walls of blood vessels, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This also reduces the workload on the heart and subsequently lowers blood pressure.  It achieves this by blocking the entry of calcium into the cells of blood vessel walls.

The combination of these two drugs provides a synergistic effect, meaning they work together more effectively than either drug alone to lower blood pressure.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Olmesartan Medoxomil/Azelnidipine?** A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so combining it with this medication may cause excessive blood pressure lowering and increase the risk of dizziness or fainting.  Moderate alcohol consumption should be discussed with your doctor.

* **Q: Can I take Olmesartan Medoxomil/Azelnidipine with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications can interact negatively with this combination.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking Olmesartan Medoxomil/Azelnidipine suddenly?** A: No, stopping this medication abruptly can be harmful.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: What are the precautions?** A:  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking this medication.  People with kidney or liver problems, heart failure, or certain other health conditions may need special monitoring while on this medication.
