# Omeprazole + Dicyclomine
### Generic Name
Omeprazole + Dicyclomine

**Note:**  Omeprazole and dicyclomine are typically prescribed as separate medications, not as a fixed-dose combination.  A combined formulation might exist under a brand name in some regions, but this information should not be considered medical advice. Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for accurate information on any medication you are prescribed. This information focuses on the individual actions of omeprazole and dicyclomine.

### Usage

**Omeprazole:** This is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Its primary use is to reduce stomach acid production.  It's commonly prescribed for:

* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):**  To heal and prevent the return of acid reflux symptoms like heartburn and acid indigestion.
* **Peptic Ulcers:** To help ulcers heal and prevent recurrence.
* **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** A rare condition characterized by excessive stomach acid production.
* **Helicobacter pylori infection:** Often used in combination with antibiotics to eradicate this bacteria, a common cause of ulcers.
* **Erosive esophagitis:**  Inflammation and damage to the esophagus caused by stomach acid.


**Dicyclomine:** This is an anticholinergic or antispasmodic drug. It works by relaxing the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. This is helpful in reducing:

* **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms:** Primarily focusing on abdominal cramping and pain.
* **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)-related symptoms:**  While not a treatment for the underlying condition, it can help manage some symptoms.
* **Functional dyspepsia:**  Upper abdominal discomfort that isn't caused by an easily identifiable medical condition.
* **Abdominal pain:** Associated with various gastrointestinal conditions.


### Dosage

**Omeprazole:** Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual.  It's available in various forms (tablets, capsules, delayed-release capsules, oral suspension).  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose and duration.  Generally, for adults, it might range from 20mg to 40mg daily.  Children's doses are significantly lower and must be determined by a physician based on weight and condition. IV formulations are available but require administration by a healthcare professional.

**Dicyclomine:** Dosage also depends on the condition and individual.  It's available as tablets and capsules.  Adult doses usually range from 20mg to 40mg several times daily, but precise dosing will be determined by the prescribing physician.  Children's doses require careful consideration by a pediatrician.  IV formulations are available but are typically used in a hospital setting.


### Side Effects

**Omeprazole:**

* Common: Headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence.
* Less Common but Serious:  Bone fractures (with long-term use), *Clostridium difficile* infection (a severe intestinal infection), vitamin B12 deficiency.

**Dicyclomine:**

* Common: Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, drowsiness, urinary retention.
* Less Common but Serious:  Increased heart rate, confusion, hallucinations (especially in older adults), severe allergic reactions.


**Important:**  This is not an exhaustive list. Consult a healthcare professional if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

**Omeprazole:**  It works by irreversibly blocking the proton pump in the stomach cells, which is responsible for secreting acid.  This significantly reduces the amount of acid produced.

**Dicyclomine:** It blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal tract. By blocking acetylcholine, dicyclomine reduces muscle spasms and relaxes the intestines.

### Precautions

**Omeprazole:**

* **Contraindications:**  Known allergy to omeprazole or related PPIs.
* **Interactions:**  May interact with several medications, including anticoagulants, clopidogrel (Plavix), certain antifungal medications.
* **Warnings:**  Long-term use may increase the risk of bone fractures and infections.  It should be used cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women.


**Dicyclomine:**

* **Contraindications:**  Known allergy to dicyclomine, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, urinary retention, severe ulcerative colitis.
* **Interactions:**  May interact with other anticholinergics and certain heart medications.
* **Warnings:**  Should be used cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women, older adults, and individuals with certain heart conditions.  Can exacerbate existing constipation.
