# Oxyphenbutazone

**Generic Name:** Oxyphenbutazone

**Usage:**  Oxyphenbutazone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was once used to treat pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Osteoarthritis
* Gout
* Bursitis
* Tendinitis
* Other inflammatory conditions

**Important Note:**  Oxyphenbutazone is largely unavailable in many countries due to significant safety concerns.  Its use is extremely limited and generally only considered in exceptional circumstances when other, safer NSAIDs have failed.  It should **only** be used under the strict supervision of a physician.

**Side Effects:** Oxyphenbutazone carries a substantial risk of serious side effects, which is a primary reason for its restricted use. These can include:

* **Gastrointestinal problems:**  These are common and can range from mild upset stomach and heartburn to serious complications like ulcers, bleeding, and perforation (holes) in the stomach or intestines.
* **Kidney problems:**  Oxyphenbutazone can damage the kidneys, leading to fluid retention, increased blood pressure, and even kidney failure.
* **Liver problems:**  Liver damage, including hepatitis, is a potential side effect.
* **Blood disorders:**  It can suppress bone marrow function, leading to anemia, decreased white blood cell count (increasing infection risk), and decreased platelet count (increasing bleeding risk).
* **Heart problems:**  Increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
* **Fluid retention:** Swelling in the legs and ankles.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Skin rashes, itching, and hives.  Severe allergic reactions are possible.
* **Headaches:**
* **Dizziness:**


**How it Works:** Oxyphenbutazone works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever.  However, its mechanism of action also involves other pathways that contribute to its toxicity.
