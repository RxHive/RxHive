# Obeticholic acid

**Generic Name:** Obeticholic acid

**Usage:**

Obeticholic acid is primarily used to treat:

* **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC):**  It's approved for adults with PBC who have inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).  It's used to reduce liver damage and improve liver function tests.
* **Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH):**  It's approved for adults with NASH with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (meaning significant liver scarring) who have elevated ALT levels. The goal is to reduce fibrosis (liver scarring).


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Itching (pruritus):** This is often one of the most frequently reported side effects.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or lacking energy.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Increased LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol):**  Regular monitoring of lipid levels is essential.
* **Increased risk of gallstones:**  This can lead to abdominal pain.
* **Elevated blood sugar (hyperglycemia):** Particularly relevant for patients with diabetes.
* **Elevated creatinine levels:** Indicative of kidney issues.
* **Hepatotoxicity (liver damage):** In rare cases, obeticholic acid can worsen liver problems.


**How it Works:**

Obeticholic acid is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist.  FXR is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating bile acid metabolism and other metabolic processes in the liver and intestines.  By activating FXR, obeticholic acid helps to:

* **Reduce bile acid synthesis:**  This decreases the amount of bile acids circulating in the liver, reducing inflammation and liver damage.
* **Improve bile flow:**  Helping to clear toxins and waste from the liver.
* **Reduce liver inflammation and fibrosis:**  This is the main mechanism by which it improves NASH and PBC.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The effects of obeticholic acid may not be noticeable immediately.  It typically takes several weeks or months to see improvement in liver function tests and symptoms.
* **Q: How is it taken?** A: It's usually taken once daily orally.
* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, there are potential interactions with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Q:  Who shouldn't take it?** A: People with certain liver conditions, kidney problems, or those with severe hypercholesterolemia may not be suitable candidates. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also generally avoid it.  Your doctor will assess your suitability.
* **Q:  What are the monitoring requirements?** A:  Regular blood tests (liver function tests, lipid panel, blood sugar, and creatinine) are necessary to monitor for side effects and efficacy.
