# Obeticholic Acid
### Generic Name
Obeticholic Acid

### Usage

Obeticholic acid is primarily used to treat primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic liver disease.  It's specifically indicated for patients whose condition hasn't responded adequately to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), another medication used for PBC, or for those who can't tolerate UDCA.  In essence, obeticholic acid is a second-line treatment option or an alternative for those who don't benefit from or can't take UDCA.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Primary Biliary Cholangitis):**  Dosage varies significantly depending on liver function, as assessed by the Child-Pugh classification.

* **Non-cirrhotic or compensated Child-Pugh Class A:**  The initial oral dose is 5 mg once daily. If the serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or total bilirubin levels don't improve enough after three months, the dose may be increased to 10 mg once daily (maximum dose).

* **Child-Pugh Class B or C, or patients with a prior decompensation event:** The initial dose is significantly lower due to increased risk of liver problems.  It starts at 5 mg once weekly.  If serum ALP and/or total bilirubin levels aren't improving after three months, the dose can be increased to 5 mg twice weekly (at least three days apart).  Further increase to 10 mg twice weekly (at least three days apart) might be considered based on response and tolerance, but this is the maximum dose.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of obeticholic acid in children haven't been established.  It should not be used in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A), no dosage adjustment is needed.  However, for moderate to severe impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C), the starting dose is significantly reduced (5 mg once weekly), and increases are made cautiously based on response and tolerance.

* **Renal Impairment:** The safety and effectiveness in patients with kidney problems haven't been established.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Itching (pruritus)
* Abdominal pain and discomfort

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Palpitations
* Dizziness
* Skin rash and eczema
* Thyroid function abnormalities
* Constipation
* Joint pain (arthralgia)
* Oropharyngeal pain
* Fever (pyrexia)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  These are rare but can be severe and potentially life-threatening: Cholangitis, ascites, jaundice, worsening of PBC, hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, increased bilirubin levels, and new-onset or worsening cirrhosis.


**Important Note:** If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Obeticholic acid is a type of medication called a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist.  FXR is a receptor in the liver and intestines that plays a crucial role in regulating bile acids, inflammation, and fibrosis (scarring).  By activating FXR, obeticholic acid decreases the amount of bile acids in liver cells, reducing liver damage and improving liver function in individuals with PBC. This is accomplished by decreasing the production of new bile acids and increasing their removal from the liver.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Obeticholic acid is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components and in those with complete biliary obstruction (blockage of bile ducts).

* **Warnings:**  There's a boxed warning about the risk of severe liver problems, including liver failure, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or Child-Pugh Class B or C liver impairment if dosed more frequently than recommended.

* **Increased Risk:** Patients using obeticholic acid may experience an increased risk of severe itching, worsening liver problems, and changes in cholesterol levels.

* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with warfarin may reduce its effectiveness.  Concurrent use with CYP1A2 substrates may increase their levels.  Bile-acid sequestrants can reduce the effectiveness of obeticholic acid.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown.  It should be used cautiously in these situations.

* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in elderly patients and those with pre-existing liver or kidney disease.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take obeticholic acid with food?** A: Yes, it can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store obeticholic acid?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take two doses at once.  Follow your doctor's guidance for missed doses, especially if you are on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of taking obeticholic acid?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known, but regular monitoring of liver function and cholesterol levels is essential.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking obeticholic acid suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking any medication suddenly without consulting your doctor.  They will help you to gradually reduce the dosage to minimize the potential for withdrawal symptoms or a worsening of your condition.
