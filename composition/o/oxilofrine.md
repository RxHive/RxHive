# Oxilofrine
### Generic Name
Oxilofrine

### Usage
Oxilofrine, a sympathomimetic amine chemically related to ephedrine and synephrine, has primarily been used in the past to treat hypotensive states (low blood pressure).  This means it was employed to raise blood pressure when it fell dangerously low. It has also seen use in combination with antitussive medications (cough suppressants), though this application is less common now.  It's important to note that oxilofrine's use in medicine is limited, and its primary current relevance stems from its detection as a prohibited substance in sports due to its performance-enhancing properties.

### Dosage
Precise dosage recommendations for oxilofrine are not readily available due to its limited current medical use.  Historically, the dosage varied depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  It was typically administered orally as the hydrochloride salt.  Any use should be strictly under the supervision of a physician, and self-medication is strongly discouraged.  Dosage information from historical sources should not be used to self-treat.

### Side Effects
The side effects of oxilofrine can vary depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects may include:

* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Increased blood pressure (hypertension)
* Headaches
* Dizziness
* Anxiety
* Insomnia
* Tremors
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious, side effects are possible and may include cardiovascular complications.  If any adverse effects occur, immediately consult a healthcare professional.

### How it Works
Oxilofrine acts as a sympathomimetic agent, meaning it mimics the effects of the sympathetic nervous system.  It directly stimulates both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors.  Alpha-receptor stimulation causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), leading to increased blood pressure.  Beta-receptor stimulation increases heart rate and the force of heart contractions (positive inotropic and chronotropic effects), further contributing to elevated blood pressure.  Additionally, it's believed to enhance the effects of norepinephrine by boosting its production, release, and inhibiting its reuptake.

### Precautions
Oxilofrine is not widely used in modern medicine and carries significant risks.  It should only be administered under strict medical supervision.  Contraindications include individuals with a history of heart conditions, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, or other conditions that might be exacerbated by increased heart rate and blood pressure.  Interaction with other medications, particularly those affecting the cardiovascular system, is a serious concern.  Oxilofrine is specifically prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in competitive sports.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should strictly avoid oxilofrine.  Older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions are particularly vulnerable to its adverse effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Is oxilofrine available over the counter?** A: No, oxilofrine is not available over the counter and requires a prescription (although its current medical use is very limited).
* **Q: Can oxilofrine be used for weight loss?** A:  Oxilofrine's use in weight-loss supplements is strongly discouraged due to its potential for serious cardiovascular side effects.
* **Q: How should oxilofrine be stored?** A:  If prescribed, follow the storage instructions provided by your physician or pharmacist.  Generally, medications should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from children.
* **Q: What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if an overdose is suspected.
* **Q: Is oxilofrine safe?** A:  Oxilofrine carries significant risks, and its use should be strictly limited to situations where a physician deems it absolutely necessary and under close medical supervision.  The potential for serious cardiovascular events outweighs any potential benefits in most situations.
