# Oxandrolone
### Generic Name
Oxandrolone

### Usage
Oxandrolone is a synthetic anabolic steroid primarily used as adjunctive therapy to promote weight gain in individuals who have experienced significant weight loss due to extensive surgery, chronic infections, or severe trauma.  It's also employed in cases where weight gain is insufficient despite the absence of clear underlying medical reasons.  Another application is to counteract the protein breakdown (catabolism) associated with long-term corticosteroid use.  Finally, it can provide relief from bone pain often linked to osteoporosis.  While not its primary indication, oxandrolone has also seen off-label use in treating severe burns to aid in muscle mass increase and wound healing.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Weight gain (adjunctive therapy):**  2.5–20 mg orally, divided into 2–4 doses daily, adjusted based on individual response.  Treatment courses typically last 2–4 weeks, with intermittent repetition as needed.

* **Severe burns (off-label):** 10 mg orally or via enteral feeding tube every 12 hours, commencing approximately 5 days post-injury.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the child's weight and age.  Always follow a doctor's precise instructions. Examples include:

* **Weight gain (adjunctive therapy):**  Up to 0.1 mg/kg/day, divided and given as needed.

* **Severe burns:** 0.1 mg/kg/dose twice daily for up to 12 months.

* **Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) in males (ages 9-16):** 1.25–2.5 mg once daily in the evening, for 3–12 months.

* **Turner syndrome in females (age 8 and older):** 0.03–0.06 mg/kg/day at bedtime, often in combination with growth hormone and/or estrogen.  Maximum single dose is 2.5 mg.  Doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day should generally be avoided due to virilization risk. Treatment duration is typically until the goal height is reached or further growth is unlikely.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment; however, caution is advised in these cases. For hepatic impairment, discontinue use if liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal or cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice develops. For renal impairment, exercise caution due to the potential for edema (swelling).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these side effects isn't consistently defined across studies.

* Nervous system: Voice deepening (in females), depression, excitement, insomnia.
* Cardiovascular: Edema (swelling).
* Dermatological: Acne (females and prepubertal males), hair loss (females).
* Endocrine/Metabolic: Changes in libido, decreased glucose tolerance, altered cholesterol levels (HDL decrease, LDL increase), electrolyte imbalances, gynecomastia (breast development in males), hirsutism (excessive hair growth in females), menstrual irregularities (females), suppressed gonadotropin secretion.
* Hematologic: Impaired clotting, prolonged prothrombin time.
* Hepatic: Cholestatic jaundice, liver cell tumors, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin), peliosis hepatitis (with long-term use).
* Neuromuscular/Skeletal: Elevated creatine phosphokinase, premature epiphyseal closure (in children).
* Genitourinary: Clitoromegaly (enlarged clitoris in females), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis in postpubertal males), erectile dysfunction (prepubertal males and increased/persistent erections), impotence (postpubertal males), impaired testicular function (postpubertal males), urinary irritation (postpubertal males), oligospermia (reduced sperm count in postpubertal males), penile enlargement (prepubertal males), priapism (persistent, painful erection), testicular atrophy (postpubertal males).
* Renal: Increased creatinine clearance.

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  Hepatic necrosis (liver cell death) and severe hepatotoxicity are possible, though rare.


**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works

Oxandrolone is a synthetic derivative of testosterone, exhibiting both androgenic (masculinizing) and anabolic (muscle-building) properties.  It interacts with androgen receptors in cells, promoting protein synthesis and reducing protein breakdown, leading to increased muscle mass and potentially improved weight gain.  Its effect on bone pain in osteoporosis is likely due to its anabolic effects on bone tissue.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Oxandrolone is contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected prostate or breast cancer (males), hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), nephrosis (kidney disease), breast cancer with hypercalcemia (females), and pregnancy (risk of fetal masculinization).

**Warnings:**  Increased risks include blood lipid changes, gynecomastia, hepatic effects (peliosis hepatis and liver cell tumors), oligospermia, polycythemia (increased red blood cell count), and priapism or excessive sexual stimulation.

**Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hepatic impairment, breast cancer (females), conditions affected by edema, and in the elderly.

**Boxed Warning:**  Oxandrolone carries a boxed warning regarding the risks of peliosis hepatis (blood-filled cysts in the liver) and liver cell tumors.  These conditions can be life-threatening.  Blood lipid changes associated with atherosclerosis are also a significant concern.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Oxandrolone without a prescription?** A: No, Oxandrolone is a prescription-only medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: How should I store Oxandrolone?** A: Store Oxandrolone as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary recommendations while taking Oxandrolone?** A: Your doctor may recommend dietary changes to support the medication's effects and maintain overall health. This could involve increased protein intake.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see results varies depending on the individual and the condition being treated.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can Oxandrolone be used for bodybuilding or athletic performance enhancement?** A:  While Oxandrolone has anabolic properties, its use for bodybuilding or athletic enhancement is illegal and poses significant health risks.  Do not use this medication for purposes not prescribed by your doctor.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Oxandrolone?** A: Long-term use is associated with increased risk of several serious side effects, including liver damage and liver tumors. Consult your doctor regularly to monitor your health and assess the potential benefits and risks of continuing treatment.
