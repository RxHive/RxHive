# Ornidazole
### Generic Name
Ornidazole

### Usage
Ornidazole is a medication primarily used to treat infections caused by protozoa (single-celled organisms) and anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that thrive in oxygen-free environments).  Its primary uses include treating various forms of amoebiasis (infection with *Entamoeba histolytica*), giardiasis (infection with *Giardia lamblia*), and trichomoniasis (infection with *Trichomonas vaginalis*).  Ornidazole is also effective against anaerobic bacterial infections, often used in the treatment of postoperative infections to prevent complications.  In severe cases of amoebiasis, such as amoebic liver abscess, intravenous administration might be necessary.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific infection being treated and the route of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's prescription precisely.  Examples include:

* **Amoebiasis:** 0.5g twice daily (BID) for 5-10 days (oral).  Higher doses might be used for severe infections.
* **Amoebic dysentery:** 1.5g as a single daily dose for 3 days (oral), or higher doses for those weighing over 60kg.
* **Giardiasis:** 1-1.5g as a single daily dose for 1-2 days (oral).
* **Trichomoniasis:** 1.5g as a single dose or 0.5g BID for 5 days (oral).  Treatment of sexual partners is crucial.
* **Severe Amoebic Infections/Anaerobic Bacterial Infections:** Intravenous administration is used, with initial doses ranging from 0.5-1g followed by subsequent doses as directed by a physician.  The duration of treatment typically ranges from 3-10 days.
* **Postoperative Anaerobic Bacterial Infection Prophylaxis:** A single 1g intravenous dose is typically administered about 30 minutes before surgery.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is calculated based on their weight (mg/kg/day) and the specific infection. It's crucial to consult a pediatrician for accurate dosage determination as it varies significantly depending on the condition and the child's weight and age.  Examples include:

* **Amoebiasis:** 25 mg/kg as a single daily dose for 5-10 days (oral)
* **Amoebic dysentery:** 40 mg/kg/day (oral)
* **Giardiasis:** 30-40 mg/kg/day (oral)
* **Trichomoniasis:** 25mg/kg as a single dose (oral)
* **Severe Amoebic Infections/Anaerobic Bacterial Infections:** Intravenous administration is used, with dosage determined by a physician based on weight and condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with severe hepatic (liver) impairment, often involving doubling the interval between doses.  Renal (kidney) impairment usually doesn't require dose adjustment, though hemodialysis patients may require a supplemental dose before dialysis.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:  somnolence (sleepiness), headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and taste disturbances.

Less common but serious side effects: tremor, rigidity, poor coordination, seizures, tiredness, vertigo, temporary loss of consciousness, signs of sensory or mixed peripheral neuropathy, and skin reactions.  Abnormal liver function test results have also been reported.

**If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works

Ornidazole belongs to the 5-nitroimidazole class of drugs.  It works by interfering with the DNA of protozoa and anaerobic bacteria.  The drug is converted into active metabolites within the organism, which damage the DNA structure, inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately leading to the death of the infectious agent.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ornidazole is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to ornidazole or other nitroimidazole drugs.
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment, and in those with central nervous system disorders (e.g., epilepsy, multiple sclerosis).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ornidazole can interact with coumarin-type oral anticoagulants (blood thinners), potentially increasing their effect. It can also prolong the effect of vecuronium bromide (a muscle relaxant).  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ornidazole is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus exist.  The decision to use it during pregnancy should be made carefully, weighing the benefits against the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, requiring careful consideration before use by breastfeeding mothers.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment and for at least 3 days after stopping Ornidazole, as it can cause a disulfiram-like reaction (severe nausea, vomiting, and headache).


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Ornidazole with food?** A: Yes, the oral form can be taken with food.

* **Q: How should I store Ornidazole?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can Ornidazole affect my ability to drive?** A: Yes, it can cause drowsiness and dizziness, affecting your ability to drive or operate machinery. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Ornidazole affects you.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Ornidazole when I feel better?** A: No, complete the prescribed course of treatment even if you feel better to ensure the infection is completely eradicated.
