# Ornidazole + Diloxanide

**Generic Name:** Ornidazole + Diloxanide furoate

**Usage:** This combination drug is used to treat amoebiasis, a parasitic infection of the intestines caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  It's effective against both the intestinal and extra-intestinal (invasive) forms of the disease, though usually requires a combination therapy with other drugs for invasive amoebiasis.  Ornidazole targets the trophozoites (active feeding stage) of the parasite, while diloxanide furoate acts primarily on the cysts (dormant, infective stage) residing in the intestines.  The combination helps to eradicate both forms of the parasite.  It is usually prescribed for a specific duration as directed by a physician.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary from person to person but common ones include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.  These are generally mild and transient.
* **Nervous System:** Headache, dizziness, vertigo, peripheral neuropathy (rare, but serious).
* **Hematological:** Rarely, changes in blood cell counts.
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rash, itching, hives.
* **Other:**  Metallic taste in the mouth.


**How it Works:**

* **Ornidazole:** This is a nitroimidazole antibiotic. It works by disrupting the DNA of *Entamoeba histolytica*, leading to parasite death.  It's effective against the trophozoites (the active, multiplying stage of the parasite).

* **Diloxanide furoate:** This is an amoebicide that acts primarily against the cysts of *Entamoeba histolytica* in the intestines. It interferes with the parasite's metabolism, preventing cyst formation and maturation.  This is crucial for preventing reinfection and transmission.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  Symptoms should start to improve within a few days, but the full course of medication is crucial to eliminate the infection completely.  Follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  No. Alcohol should be avoided during treatment and for a few days after completing the course, as it can interact negatively with ornidazole and increase the risk of side effects.

* **Q: Can I take this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A:  This should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding under strict medical supervision. The benefits must outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A:  Yes, potential interactions exist with certain medications. Inform your doctor about all other medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.
