# Ornidazole + Diloxanide
### Generic Name
Ornidazole + Diloxanide

### Usage
Ornidazole + Diloxanide is a combination medication used to treat intestinal infections caused by certain parasites.  Its primary use is in the treatment of amoebiasis, specifically intestinal amoebiasis caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  This includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.  While its primary target is *Entamoeba histolytica*, it can also be effective against other intestinal protozoa, although this is not its primary indication and other medications might be preferred for those infections.  The combination's effectiveness stems from the synergistic action of its two components. Ornidazole acts as a potent antiprotozoal agent, effectively eliminating the parasites, while diloxanide furoate works by preventing the parasites from establishing themselves in the intestinal tract.  This dual action helps clear existing infections and reduces the risk of recurrence.

### Dosage
Dosage will vary depending on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  Always follow the prescription given by a healthcare professional.  Generic dosage information is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

* **Adults:** The typical dosage is one tablet of Ornidazole + Diloxanide three times daily for ten days.  However, the specific daily dosage and treatment duration will be determined by the prescribing physician.  The formulation commonly comes as tablets for oral administration.

* **Children:** Dosage for children is typically determined by weight and should always be prescribed by a doctor. There is no standardized pediatric dosage for this combination medication that can be presented generally.  Liquid formulations or different dosages might be available for children, but these are prescribed based on individual assessment.

* **IV Administration:**  This combination medication is not typically administered intravenously. Ornidazole and Diloxanide Furoate are usually given orally.  Intravenous administration of either drug individually might be considered in certain circumstances (e.g., severe cases where oral administration is not possible), but this would be under the strict guidance of a medical professional and not using the combined formulation.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, metallic taste in the mouth, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  These are rare but require immediate medical attention.  They include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), liver damage (hepatotoxicity), and blood disorders.
* **Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.

### How it Works
Ornidazole is a nitroimidazole derivative that works by interfering with the DNA of the *Entamoeba histolytica* parasite. This disruption prevents the parasite from multiplying and eventually leads to its death.  Diloxanide furoate, on the other hand, acts as an amoebicide with a different mechanism of action. It disrupts the parasite's metabolic processes, specifically inhibiting its growth and reproduction within the intestines, thus preventing re-infection or cyst formation. The combined effect of these two drugs results in a more effective treatment of amoebiasis, compared to using either drug alone.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ornidazole, diloxanide furoate, or any of its components.  Patients with severe liver disease should also exercise caution and consult their doctor before use.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.  Certain medications can interact with Ornidazole + Diloxanide and may affect its efficacy or increase the risk of side effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of Ornidazole + Diloxanide during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Careful monitoring is needed when prescribing to this population.

* **Alcohol Consumption:**  Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment, as this can potentiate the side effects of Ornidazole.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Ornidazole + Diloxanide to work?**  A:  You may start to feel better within a few days, but the full course of treatment (usually 10 days) is necessary to eliminate the infection and prevent recurrence.

* **Q: Can I stop taking the medication once I feel better?** A: No.  Completing the full course of medication, as prescribed by your doctor, is crucial to ensure the complete eradication of the parasite and to prevent the infection from recurring.

* **Q: How should I store Ornidazole + Diloxanide?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for children?** A: The use of this combination medication in children should be determined by a healthcare professional, based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of infection.  There's no standard pediatric dosing available generally.
