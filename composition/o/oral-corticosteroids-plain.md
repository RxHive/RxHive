**How it Works:** Corticosteroids are synthetic versions of the hormone cortisol, which is naturally produced by the adrenal glands. They work by:

* **Binding to receptors:**  They bind to specific receptors inside cells, triggering various changes in gene expression.
* **Reducing inflammation:**  This is their primary action; they suppress the inflammatory response.
* **Suppressing the immune system:**  They reduce the activity of immune cells, reducing immune-mediated damage.
* **Stabilizing cell membranes:**  Helping prevent the release of inflammatory substances.
