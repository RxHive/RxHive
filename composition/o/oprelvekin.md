# Oprelvekin
### Generic Name
Oprelvekin

### Usage
Oprelvekin is a medication used to prevent severe decreases in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and reduce the need for platelet transfusions in adults with non-myeloid cancers.  It's specifically prescribed following myelosuppressive chemotherapy (chemotherapy that suppresses bone marrow function), where there's a high risk of developing severe thrombocytopenia.  It's crucial to understand that Oprelvekin is *not* used after myeloablative chemotherapy (a much more intense form of chemotherapy that destroys bone marrow).

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical dose is 50 mcg/kg given subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily for 10-21 days. Treatment begins 6-24 hours after the completion of chemotherapy and stops at least two days before the next chemotherapy cycle.

**Renal Impairment:**  If the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is less than 30 mL/min, the dose should be reduced to 25 mcg/kg daily.  If the CrCl is 30 mL/min or greater, no dose adjustment is needed.

**Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is recommended for patients with liver impairment.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Oprelvekin in children haven't been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Mucositis (inflammation and sores in the mouth)
*   Diarrhea
*   Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
*   Vasodilation (widening of blood vessels)
*   Palpitations
*   Syncope (fainting)
*   Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*   Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal passages)
*   Cough
*   Pharyngitis (sore throat)
*   Rash
*   Edema (swelling)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

*   Pleural effusions (fluid buildup around the lungs)
*   Papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve)
*   Formation of anti-oprelvekin antibodies

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Oprelvekin is a recombinant interleukin-11, a type of protein that acts as a thrombopoietic growth factor.  This means it stimulates the production of platelets in the bone marrow. It does this by promoting the growth and maturation of megakaryocytes (cells that produce platelets).  By increasing the number of platelets, it helps prevent or reduce the severity of thrombocytopenia caused by chemotherapy.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Oprelvekin is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to oprelvekin or any of its components.

**Warnings:**  There's a boxed warning highlighting the risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction).  Oprelvekin should be stopped permanently if an allergic reaction occurs.  The drug can also cause fluid retention, potentially leading to serious cardiovascular events such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). Patients with pre-existing heart conditions, fluid retention, or a history of atrial arrhythmias should use it with extreme caution.  Similarly, patients with pre-existing papilledema or tumors involving the central nervous system require careful monitoring.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Oprelvekin administered?** A: It's administered subcutaneously (under the skin) as a single injection in the abdomen, thigh, hip, or upper arm (if not self-injecting).

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Don't double up on the next dose; continue with the regular schedule.

*   **Q: How should Oprelvekin be stored?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided with your medication. Generally, it should be refrigerated.

*   **Q: Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.

*   **Q: Is Oprelvekin safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Oprelvekin is a Category C pregnancy drug.  It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown, so a decision must be made regarding breastfeeding or continuing Oprelvekin use.  Always discuss this with your healthcare provider.
