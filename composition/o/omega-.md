# Omega-

It's impossible to provide details about a generic "Omega-" because "Omega-" is not a complete or recognized generic name for any medication or supplement.  Omega is a prefix often used to describe fatty acids, such as Omega-3, Omega-6, and Omega-9.  Each of these has different properties, uses, side effects, and mechanisms of action.

To give you helpful information, I need you to specify the *complete* name, such as "Omega-3 fatty acids" or "Omega-6 fatty acids." Then I can provide the requested details.
