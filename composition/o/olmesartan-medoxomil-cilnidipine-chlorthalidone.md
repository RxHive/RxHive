# Olmesartan Medoxomil + Cilnidipine + Chlorthalidone

**Generic Name:** Olmesartan Medoxomil/Cilnidipine/Chlorthalidone

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It combines three different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs to provide a more effective approach than using any one drug alone.  Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), cilnidipine is a calcium channel blocker, and chlorthalidone is a diuretic (water pill).  The combination is often prescribed for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with a single medication.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual, but some common ones include:

* **Headache:**  A frequent side effect, often mild.
* **Dizziness:**  Can be due to a sudden drop in blood pressure.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Cough:**  Less common than with ACE inhibitors, but still possible.
* **Muscle cramps:**  Especially in the legs.
* **Low potassium levels (hypokalemia):**  Caused by the diuretic.
* **Increased urination:**  Also due to the diuretic.
* **Lightheadedness:** Often related to postural hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing).
* **Allergic reactions (rare):**  Such as rash, itching, swelling.

**Serious side effects are less common but require immediate medical attention. These include:**

* **Angioedema:**  Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Severe allergic reactions:** Difficulty breathing, chest pain, rapid heart rate.
* **Kidney problems:** Changes in urine output, swelling in the legs and feet.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):** Muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat.

This list is not exhaustive.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil (ARB):** Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. This relaxation of blood vessels leads to lower blood pressure.
* **Cilnidipine (Calcium Channel Blocker):** Relaxes blood vessels by blocking the entry of calcium into muscle cells in the walls of blood vessels.  This reduces the contraction of these muscles, resulting in lower blood pressure.
* **Chlorthalidone (Diuretic):** Increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the urine. This reduces the volume of blood, leading to lower blood pressure.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can lower blood pressure further and increase the risk of dizziness and lightheadedness.  Moderate or avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **What are the precautions?**  This medication may not be suitable for people with certain medical conditions, such as severe kidney or liver disease, or those allergic to any of the components.  Regular monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function is often necessary.  Inform your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **How long will it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to achieve optimal blood pressure control.
* **What are the signs of low blood pressure?**  Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, nausea.
