# Omega-3-Carboxylic Acids
### Generic Name
Omega-3-Carboxylic Acids

### Usage
Omega-3-carboxylic acids, derived from fish oil, are primarily used as an adjunct to diet for reducing triglyceride (TG) levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG levels > 500 mg/dL).  It's important to note that the effect of this medication on the risk of pancreatitis or cardiovascular mortality and morbidity hasn't been definitively established.  This medication is not a first-line treatment for high triglycerides; lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, are crucial.  Omega-3-carboxylic acids are used only when lifestyle changes have been insufficient to manage severely elevated triglyceride levels.

### Dosage
**Adults (Severe Hypertriglyceridemia):** The usual oral dosage is 2 grams (2 capsules) or 4 grams (4 capsules) once daily.  Dosage should be tailored to individual patient response and tolerance.  Triglyceride levels should be closely monitored before starting treatment and throughout therapy.  Patients must be on a lipid-lowering diet before and during treatment.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of omega-3-carboxylic acids in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment by the manufacturer; however, close monitoring of liver function tests (ALT and AST) is advisable in patients with liver problems.

### Side Effects
**Common (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Diarrhea

**Less Common (affecting 1-10% of patients):**

* Nausea
* Abdominal pain/discomfort
* Eructation (belching)

**Post-marketing reports (less common, reported after the drug was released to the market):**

* Vomiting
* Flatulence (gas)
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
The exact mechanism of how omega-3-carboxylic acids lower triglycerides isn't fully understood.  However, several potential mechanisms are proposed:  inhibition of an enzyme involved in triglyceride synthesis (acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase), increased breakdown of fats in the liver (mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation), decreased fat production in the liver (lipogenesis), and increased activity of an enzyme that breaks down fats in the blood (lipoprotein lipase).  Essentially, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) are poor substrates for the enzymes that make triglycerides, and they also inhibit the use of other fatty acids in triglyceride formation.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:**  Omega-3-carboxylic acids are contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to the medication or any of its components.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Allergy:** Use with caution in patients with known allergies to fish and/or shellfish. An allergic reaction is possible, though the risk isn't fully defined.
* **Bleeding:** Omega-3 fatty acids may prolong bleeding time.  Careful monitoring is necessary if used concurrently with anticoagulants (blood thinners) or antiplatelet agents (drugs that prevent blood clots).
* **Increased LDL Cholesterol:** There's a potential for an increase in LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels; therefore, monitoring of LDL cholesterol is important during treatment.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Omega-3-carboxylic acids are categorized as Pregnancy Category C. Use during pregnancy is only justified if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. The medication may be excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised when used by breastfeeding women.


### FAQs
**Q: Can I take omega-3-carboxylic acids with other medications?**
A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.  Omega-3 fatty acids can interact with blood thinners and other medications affecting blood clotting.

**Q: How should I store omega-3-carboxylic acids?**
A:  Store as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

**Q:  What if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's nearly time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

**Q: Are there any long-term effects of taking omega-3-carboxylic acids?**
A: Long-term effects haven't been extensively studied. Regular monitoring of triglyceride levels and other relevant parameters is essential during prolonged use.  Discuss any concerns with your healthcare provider.

**Q:  Is it safe to take omega-3-carboxylic acids if I have liver or kidney problems?**
A: While no specific dose adjustments are recommended, your doctor should closely monitor your liver function tests (ALT and AST) if you have liver problems. Discuss the use of this medication with your healthcare provider if you have kidney or liver disease.
