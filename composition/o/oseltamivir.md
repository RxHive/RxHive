# Oseltamivir
### Generic Name
Oseltamivir

### Usage

Oseltamivir is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat and prevent influenza (flu) caused by influenza viruses A and B.  It's not effective against other viruses like those causing the common cold or COVID-19.  The drug works by inhibiting neuraminidase, an enzyme vital for the influenza virus to reproduce and spread within the body.  Treatment is most effective when started within 48 hours of symptom onset, though it can still offer some benefit even later for severe cases.  Prophylactic use helps protect individuals from contracting the flu, particularly useful during outbreaks or for high-risk individuals exposed to infected people.  While primarily used for seasonal flu, oseltamivir has also been used off-label in treating avian influenza (e.g., H5N1, H7N9), though its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific strain.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Oral):**

* **Treatment of Seasonal Influenza:** 75 mg twice daily (BID) for 5 days.  Longer durations may be considered for severe or immunocompromised patients; however, higher doses (150 mg BID) are not currently recommended.  For mild illness in outpatients not at high risk, treatment should ideally begin within 48 hours of symptom onset.
* **Prophylaxis (Prevention) of Seasonal Influenza:** 75 mg once daily (OD) for the duration of the outbreak or as recommended by a healthcare provider.  Post-exposure prophylaxis (after exposure to an infected person) typically lasts for one week (if previously vaccinated) or two weeks (if unvaccinated).  In outbreaks, all residents of a facility might receive prophylaxis regardless of vaccination status.


**Pediatric Dosage (Oral):**

Dosage for children is weight-based and varies depending on age and weight.  Always follow a healthcare provider's instructions.  Dosages are typically given twice daily for treatment and once daily for prevention.  Consult the prescribing information for precise weight-based dosing charts for both treatment and prophylaxis.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney or liver problems.  Patients with severe kidney disease may require significantly reduced doses or alternative administration schedules.  Consult a healthcare provider or pharmacist for specific guidance based on individual kidney or liver function.

**Administration:** Oseltamivir is available as capsules or oral suspension (liquid). Capsules can be opened and the contents mixed with a palatable liquid if swallowing difficulties exist.  The oral suspension must be shaken well before each use.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Neuropsychiatric events (confusion, hallucinations, abnormal behavior, seizures)
* Liver problems
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)

If any serious or concerning side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Oseltamivir is a prodrug, meaning it's inactive until converted into its active form, oseltamivir carboxylate, in the body.  This active form blocks the influenza virus neuraminidase enzyme.  Neuraminidase is essential for the virus to release from infected cells and spread to other cells. By inhibiting this enzyme, oseltamivir limits the virus's ability to replicate and spread, reducing the severity and duration of the flu.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** Oseltamivir should not be used by individuals with known allergies to oseltamivir or any of its ingredients.
* **Kidney Disease:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with kidney impairment.
* **Liver Disease:**  Caution is advised in patients with severe liver disease.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Oseltamivir is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Consult a doctor before using it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Oseltamivir may interact with other medications. Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Neuropsychiatric Events:**  A small risk of neuropsychiatric events exists, particularly in children and adolescents. Close monitoring is essential if these events occur.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take oseltamivir to prevent getting the flu?** A: Yes, oseltamivir can be used for prophylaxis (prevention) in certain situations, particularly during influenza outbreaks or for individuals at high risk of complications.  A healthcare provider should determine if prophylaxis is appropriate.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  Symptom improvement usually starts within 1-2 days, but the full course of treatment should be completed.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store oseltamivir?** A: Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q:  Is oseltamivir effective against COVID-19?** A: No, oseltamivir is not effective against COVID-19.
