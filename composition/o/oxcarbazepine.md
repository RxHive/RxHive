# Oxcarbazepine
### Generic Name
Oxcarbazepine

### Usage
Oxcarbazepine is primarily used to treat partial seizures, either as the sole medication (monotherapy) or alongside other anti-seizure drugs (adjunctive therapy).  Partial seizures are seizures that affect only one part of the brain.  It's effective in treating focal-onset seizures, with or without the spread to other parts of the brain leading to generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  

Importantly, oxcarbazepine is *not* recommended for myoclonic seizures (brief, jerking movements) or generalized non-motor seizures (absence seizures, characterized by brief lapses in awareness).  In fact, using it for these types of seizures may worsen the condition.

While its primary use is for epilepsy, oxcarbazepine is also sometimes used off-label to manage conditions like trigeminal neuralgia (intense facial pain), bipolar disorder (mood swings), and diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage due to diabetes).  These off-label uses are based on observations and not necessarily supported by large-scale clinical trials.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, whether it's monotherapy or adjunctive therapy, and the specific formulation (immediate-release tablets or suspension, or extended-release tablets). It's crucial to follow your doctor's precise instructions.  Generally, treatment begins with a low dose, which is gradually increased until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum tolerated dose is reached.  

* **Partial Seizures (Adjunctive Therapy):**  Immediate-release: starts at 300 mg twice daily (600 mg/day), increasing by up to 600 mg/day weekly, with a maximum of 1200-2400 mg/day. Extended-release: starts at 300 mg twice daily (600 mg/day), increasing by 600 mg/day weekly, with a maximum of 2400 mg/day.

* **Partial Seizures (Monotherapy):** Immediate-release: starts at 300 mg twice daily (600 mg/day), increasing by 300 mg/day every third day, with a maximum of 1200 mg/day. Extended-release: starts at 600 mg daily for one week, then increases to 1200-2400 mg/day in 600 mg increments weekly.

* **Conversion to Monotherapy:**  The transition from adjunctive to monotherapy involves gradually reducing the dose of other anti-seizure medications while simultaneously increasing the oxcarbazepine dose over several weeks.

* **Trigeminal Neuralgia (Off-Label):** Starts at 300-600 mg/day in divided doses, increasing by 300 mg/day every three or more days as tolerated, up to a maximum of 1800 mg/day.

* **Bipolar Disorder & Diabetic Neuropathy (Off-Label):** Doses vary considerably, typically starting at lower doses and carefully titrated up based on response and tolerance.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Dosage is based on body weight (mg/kg/day) and age.  Children's doses are significantly lower than adult doses and require close monitoring by a physician.  Refer to your child's physician for precise instructions.  Specific dose ranges are complex and depend on factors like age, weight, and the specific form of oxcarbazepine used.

### How it Works

Oxcarbazepine's main active form is its metabolite, 10-monohydroxy-oxcarbazepine (MHD).  Both oxcarbazepine and MHD work by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cells.  These channels are involved in the transmission of nerve impulses. By blocking them, oxcarbazepine stabilizes overly excited nerve cells and reduces the spread of electrical activity that causes seizures.  Additionally, it's believed to affect potassium and calcium channels, contributing to its anticonvulsant effect.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Oxcarbazepine should be avoided in individuals with a history of allergy to oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, or any component of the formulation.  Caution is also warranted in those with a history of hypersensitivity to carbamazepine.

* **Drug Interactions:** Oxcarbazepine can interact with various other medications, including some anticonvulsants, oral contraceptives, and calcium channel blockers.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in individuals with kidney or liver problems.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Oxcarbazepine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning its potential risks to the fetus are unknown.  It's excreted in breast milk, so the decision to breastfeed during treatment should be made in consultation with a doctor, weighing the benefits and risks.

* **Suicidal Ideation:**  Oxcarbazepine, like other anticonvulsants, carries a risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior.  Close monitoring is crucial, particularly during the initial phases of treatment.

* **Bone Health:** Long-term use of oxcarbazepine may affect bone mineral density; regular monitoring may be needed.

* **Sodium Levels:**  Oxcarbazepine can cause hyponatremia (low sodium); regular blood tests to monitor sodium levels are recommended, especially during initial treatment.


### FAQs

* **Can I take oxcarbazepine with alcohol?** No, alcohol should be avoided while taking oxcarbazepine as it can increase drowsiness and other side effects.

* **How should I store oxcarbazepine?** Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Can I stop taking oxcarbazepine suddenly?** No, abrupt discontinuation can lead to increased seizure frequency.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **Is oxcarbazepine habit-forming?** Oxcarbazepine is not considered habit-forming in the same way as opioids or other substances of abuse, but sudden withdrawal can lead to serious health consequences.
