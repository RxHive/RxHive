# Meprobamate
### Generic Name
Meprobamate

### Usage
Meprobamate is primarily used to treat anxiety disorders.  It's a relatively older medication, and while still prescribed in some situations, newer and often safer anxiety medications are generally preferred.  It may also be used for short-term preoperative sedation to help patients relax before a surgical procedure.  However, its use in this context is also less common now due to the availability of other, potentially safer, alternatives.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**

* **Anxiety:** The usual adult dose ranges from 1200 to 1600 mg per day, divided into 3 to 4 doses.  The maximum daily dose is 2400 mg.  When stopping treatment after prolonged use of high doses (weeks or months), the dosage should be gradually reduced over 1 to 2 weeks to minimize withdrawal symptoms.  Sudden cessation can lead to anxiety, anorexia, and insomnia.
* **Preoperative Sedation:** A single dose of 400 mg is typically administered before the procedure.

**Children:**

Meprobamate is generally not recommended for children under 6 years old. For children aged 6 to 12, the dose is typically 100-200 mg, divided into 2-3 doses.  Children over 12 years old may receive the adult dose, but this should be determined and monitored carefully by a physician.

* **Preoperative Sedation (Children >12):** 200 mg prior to the procedure.  For children under 12, the dose must be determined by a physician, considering the child's weight and the specifics of the procedure.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer specific dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Use in these populations should be approached cautiously, and close monitoring is essential.  Some guidelines suggest adjusting the dosing interval for patients with reduced kidney function, but this should be guided by a physician's professional judgment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Vertigo
* Syncope (fainting)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Slurred speech
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Weakness
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Visual disturbances
* Euphoria
* Overstimulation (paradoxical excitement)
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Hypotensive crisis (sudden drop in blood pressure)

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Agranulocytosis (severe decrease in white blood cells)
* Aplastic anemia (failure of bone marrow to produce blood cells)
* Exacerbation of porphyria (a rare genetic disorder)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
The precise mechanism of meprobamate's action isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to affect multiple sites within the central nervous system (CNS), including the thalamus and limbic system, which play critical roles in mood regulation and emotional responses. It's thought to work by enhancing the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which is involved in reducing nerve excitability. This results in a calming effect.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Meprobamate is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to meprobamate or related drugs (carisoprodol, mebutamate, tybamate, and carbromal), and those with acute intermittent porphyria.
* **Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as opioids, barbiturates, and antihistamines, as this can increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression.  Using meprobamate with oral contraceptives might increase breakthrough bleeding.
* **Warnings:** Use caution in patients with respiratory disorders, muscle weakness, depression, suicidal tendencies, history of drug abuse or acute alcoholism, liver or kidney impairment, or a history of seizure disorders.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Meprobamate is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning there's evidence of risk to the fetus.  It's generally avoided during pregnancy. It's also excreted in breast milk, making it unsuitable for breastfeeding mothers.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take meprobamate with alcohol?** A: No, combining meprobamate with alcohol can significantly increase the risk of CNS depression, potentially leading to serious consequences.
* **Q: How should I store meprobamate?** A: Store meprobamate at room temperature, away from moisture and light, and out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I stop taking meprobamate suddenly?** A: No, abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Always taper off the medication gradually under your doctor's supervision.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Is meprobamate addictive?** A:  Yes, prolonged use of meprobamate can lead to both physical and psychological dependence.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and not exceed the prescribed dosage.
