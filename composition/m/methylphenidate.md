# Methylphenidate

**Generic Name:** Methylphenidate

**Usage:**

Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant primarily used to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.  In ADHD, it helps improve focus, attention span, and impulse control. In narcolepsy, it reduces excessive daytime sleepiness. It's prescribed for both children and adults.  The dosage and frequency are determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the individual and dosage. Common side effects include:

* **Decreased appetite:** Leading to weight loss.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.
* **Headache:** Often mild and temporary.
* **Stomach ache:**  Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
* **Irritability:** Increased nervousness or anxiety.
* **Increased heart rate:** Palpitations or racing heart.
* **High blood pressure:** Although less common.
* **Tics:** Involuntary muscle movements or sounds.


More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* **Hallucinations:** Seeing or hearing things that aren't there.
* **Psychosis:** Loss of contact with reality.
* **Seizures:** Uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain.
* **Sudden cardiac death:** Although rare, it's a serious risk, particularly in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Rash, hives, difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

Methylphenidate works by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.  These neurotransmitters are involved in regulating attention, focus, and movement.  By increasing these neurotransmitters, methylphenidate helps improve concentration and reduce hyperactivity.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but the increased neurotransmitter levels are thought to be the key to its therapeutic effects.

* **Can I take methylphenidate with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting methylphenidate.  Interactions can occur with various drugs, including MAO inhibitors.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.
