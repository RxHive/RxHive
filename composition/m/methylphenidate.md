# Methylphenidate
### Generic Name
Methylphenidate

### Usage
Methylphenidate is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and children aged 6 years and older.  It's also approved for the treatment of narcolepsy in adults and children of the same age range.  While its primary function is to improve focus and attention, it can also be helpful in managing impulsivity and hyperactivity associated with ADHD.  In narcolepsy, it helps to reduce excessive daytime sleepiness.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Methylphenidate products are not always bioequivalent, meaning the same milligram dose from different brands may not produce the same effect. Always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate dosage information.  The following is general guidance and should not replace consultation with a healthcare professional.

**Adults (ADHD & Narcolepsy):**

* **Immediate-Release (IR):**  Initial dose typically starts at 10-20 mg/day divided into two doses (e.g., before breakfast and lunch).  This can be increased gradually, under medical supervision, in increments of 5-10 mg per week up to a maximum of 60 mg/day, depending on individual response and tolerance.

* **Extended-Release (XR) or Sustained-Release (SR):** Initial doses vary depending on the specific formulation, but generally range from 10-25 mg once daily (OD) in the morning.  The dose may be increased, again under medical supervision, in increments of 10-15mg at intervals of 5 days or more, up to a maximum dose which varies by formulation (up to 100 mg/day in some cases, although higher doses are often associated with increased side effects).  Some extended-release formulations can be given twice daily.

* **Transdermal Patch:** The initial dose is typically 10mg applied to the hip, two hours before the desired effect is needed and removed after nine hours.  The dose can be increased to a maximum of 30mg/day in increments of 5 mg at intervals of at least one week, depending on response and tolerance.


**Children (ADHD & Narcolepsy - aged 6 years and older):**

Dosage in children is carefully titrated based on age, weight, and response. It often starts with a much lower dose than for adults (e.g., 2.5-5 mg twice daily) and is gradually increased under close medical supervision. The maximum daily dose generally shouldn't exceed 2 mg/kg of body weight.  Specific starting doses and increments vary greatly based on the formulation (immediate-release, extended-release, etc.).


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not routinely made, but it's crucial to monitor patients closely for any changes in response or adverse effects.



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Insomnia
* Headache
* Irritability
* Weight loss
* Decreased appetite
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Nausea

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less frequently reported):**

* Increased blood pressure or heart rate
* Anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, agitation, or increased irritability
* Tics or worsening of existing tics
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Psychiatric symptoms (mood changes, depression, psychosis)
* Growth suppression in children (long-term use)
* Cardiac arrhythmias

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Methylphenidate primarily works by increasing the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. These neurotransmitters are involved in focus, attention, and motor control. By increasing their availability, methylphenidate improves concentration, reduces impulsivity, and lessens hyperactivity.  The exact mechanism of action in narcolepsy is less understood but involves modulation of wakefulness pathways in the brain.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methylphenidate should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication, those currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), patients with severe hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, or hyperthyroidism, or individuals with glaucoma.  It should also be avoided in patients with a family history of or diagnosis of Tourette syndrome or tics.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Methylphenidate can interact with several medications, including antihypertensives (blood pressure medications), other CNS stimulants, and MAOIs.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Methylphenidate is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  It's also excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Children require careful dosage titration, and close monitoring is crucial due to their developmental stage. Older adults may be more sensitive to side effects, requiring careful dose adjustments and monitoring.
* **Abuse and Dependence:** Methylphenidate has a high potential for abuse and dependence.  Close monitoring is essential to mitigate this risk.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking methylphenidate suddenly?** A: No, always taper off methylphenidate under the guidance of your doctor to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store methylphenidate?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from light and moisture, and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose of immediate-release methylphenidate, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses. For extended-release formulations, follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects of using methylphenidate?** A: Long-term use may be associated with growth suppression in children, and there is a potential for the development of tolerance and dependence. Regular monitoring is necessary to assess these risks.

* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.  Some side effects might require dose adjustments or discontinuation of the medication.
