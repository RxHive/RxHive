It's crucial to understand that there is no widely recognized or approved combination medication containing both Mosapride and Dimethicone as active ingredients.  These drugs are typically used separately for different purposes.  Therefore, information about a "generic Mosapride + Dimethicone" cannot be provided accurately.  Prescribing a combination of drugs requires careful consideration by a medical professional to ensure safety and efficacy.

If you have encountered this combination mentioned somewhere, it's crucial to verify its legitimacy with a pharmacist or doctor.  They can clarify the source and provide accurate information if such a combination exists in a specific region or formulation.
