# Mupirocin + Metronidazole
### Generic Name
Mupirocin + Metronidazole


### Usage

Mupirocin and Metronidazole combination is typically used topically to treat skin infections involving both Gram-positive bacteria (like *Staphylococcus aureus*) and anaerobic bacteria (like *Bacteroides* species).  This combination is particularly effective against mixed infections where both types of bacteria are present.  It's commonly used for treating skin infections such as infected wounds, impetigo, and other bacterial skin conditions where a broad-spectrum approach is needed.  It's important to note that this combination is for topical use only and should not be ingested. The specific indications should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual's condition and the results of any necessary testing.

### Dosage

Dosage for topical Mupirocin + Metronidazole varies depending on the specific product formulation and the healthcare provider's instructions.  There isn't a standardized dosage across all products, as concentrations of each active ingredient can vary. Typically, the cream or ointment is applied thinly to the affected area two to three times daily.  The duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the infection and clinical response, typically ranging from a few days to several weeks.  

**Important Note:**  There are no established oral or intravenous formulations of this combination therapy.  This medication is strictly for topical use.  Always follow the directions provided by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.  Never exceed the recommended dose or frequency.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of topical Mupirocin + Metronidazole may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Mild redness or irritation
* Itching
* Dry skin

Less common, but more serious side effects are rare but possible. These could include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**


### How it Works

Mupirocin is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, effectively stopping the growth and multiplication of bacteria. It primarily targets Gram-positive bacteria. Metronidazole is an antimicrobial agent effective against anaerobic bacteria and some protozoa. It works by disrupting the DNA of these microorganisms, leading to their death.  The combination of these two drugs provides broad-spectrum coverage against a wider range of bacteria commonly causing skin infections.
