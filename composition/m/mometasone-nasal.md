# Mometasone (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Mometasone (Nasal)

### Usage
Mometasone nasal spray is a corticosteroid used to treat nasal symptoms associated with several conditions.  Its primary use is in managing allergic rhinitis (both seasonal and perennial), relieving symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, and nasal congestion. It's also effective in reducing nasal congestion specifically related to seasonal allergies.  Furthermore, mometasone nasal spray is used to treat nasal polyps and can be used prophylactically to prevent nasal symptoms before the start of pollen season.  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used off-label in the treatment of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis, often as an adjunctive therapy.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Allergic Rhinitis (seasonal and perennial), Nasal Congestion associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis:** Typically, 2 sprays (100 mcg) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose: 200 mcg).
* **Nasal Polyps:** Usually 2 sprays (100 mcg) in each nostril twice daily (total daily dose: 400 mcg).  Some patients may respond to a lower dose of 200 mcg once daily.
* **Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (Prophylaxis):** 2 sprays (100 mcg) in each nostril once daily, starting 2-4 weeks before pollen season begins.

**Children:** Dosages vary significantly by age and indication.  Always follow a doctor's prescription.  Examples include:

* **Allergic Rhinitis (2-11 years):**  1 spray (50 mcg) in each nostril once daily.

### How it Works

Mometasone is a corticosteroid, a type of anti-inflammatory medication. It works by reducing swelling and irritation in the nasal passages.  It affects multiple cell types and inflammatory mediators involved in allergic reactions and inflammation within the nose.  By suppressing the release of inflammatory substances, mometasone helps reduce symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and sinusitis.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Mometasone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components.
* **Interactions:**  The use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase mometasone's plasma concentration. Concomitant use should be avoided or carefully monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Mometasone is categorized as pregnancy category C. While nasal administration results in limited systemic absorption,  other medications with better pregnancy safety profiles might be preferred for pregnant women. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised for nursing mothers.
* **Children and Adolescents:**  Use in children and adolescents requires careful monitoring for growth retardation and adrenal suppression.
* **Elderly:**  While no specific dosage adjustment is needed, older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and require careful monitoring.
* **Other Precautions:**  Avoid using mometasone in patients with untreated nasal infections, recent nasal surgery or trauma, or active tuberculosis.



### FAQs
