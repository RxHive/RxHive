# Maribavir
### Generic Name
Maribavir

### Usage
Maribavir is an antiviral medication specifically designed to combat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections.  Its primary use is in adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg) who have undergone a transplant and are experiencing CMV infection or disease that hasn't responded to treatment with other antiviral drugs like ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet.  This includes cases where the CMV virus has developed resistance to these standard treatments.  Maribavir targets the CMV virus directly, helping the body fight off the infection.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The standard oral dosage is 400 mg twice daily (BID).

**Children (12 years and older, ≥35 kg):** The dosage is the same as for adults – 400 mg BID.  It's crucial to note that the safety and effectiveness of Maribavir haven't been established in children under 12 years old.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B).  Maribavir hasn't been studied in patients with severe liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild, moderate, or severe kidney impairment.  However, its use in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), including those on dialysis, hasn't been studied.
* **Co-administration with Anticonvulsants:** If Maribavir is taken with carbamazepine, the dose should be increased to 800 mg BID.  If taken with phenytoin or phenobarbital, the dose should be increased to 1200 mg BID.  This is because these anticonvulsants can reduce Maribavir's levels in the blood.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of patients) include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Taste disturbances
* Fatigue

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can occur.  It's vital to contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Maribavir works by inhibiting the activity of the CMV pUL97 kinase enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for the CMV virus's replication and spread within the body. By blocking this enzyme, Maribavir effectively prevents the virus from multiplying and causing further damage.  This targeted action helps the body's immune system to control and eliminate the infection.

### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:**  Maribavir should not be co-administered with ganciclovir or valganciclovir due to potential antagonistic effects.  It can also interact with several other medications, including certain anticonvulsants (requiring dose adjustments), antimycobacterials (rifabutin and rifampin), St. John's Wort, rosuvastatin, and immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus).  Close monitoring and potential dose adjustments may be necessary when taking these medications concurrently.  Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  There's insufficient data on Maribavir's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed by the patient and their healthcare provider.
* **Virologic Failure:** There's an increased risk of virologic failure and relapse after treatment. Close monitoring of CMV DNA levels is necessary.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Maribavir with food?** A: Yes, Maribavir can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store Maribavir?** A: Store Maribavir as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Are there any specific warnings for older adults?** A:  Older adults may be more sensitive to side effects.  Close monitoring is advised.
* **Q: What if I experience serious side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms.
