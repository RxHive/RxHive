# Minoxidil
### Generic Name
Minoxidil

### Usage
Minoxidil is primarily used to treat hair loss, specifically androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness). It's applied topically to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.  While its primary use is in treating hair loss, it also has a secondary, albeit less common, use in treating certain types of high blood pressure (hypertension). In this case, it's administered orally as a tablet, not topically.  The oral form is prescribed much less frequently now due to the availability of other, generally safer antihypertensive medications.


### Dosage
**Topical (for hair loss):** The typical dosage is applying 1 mL of 2% or 5% solution to the scalp once or twice daily, depending on the physician's recommendation.  The exact amount and frequency should always follow your doctor's instructions.  It's crucial to apply the solution only to the affected areas of the scalp.

**Oral (for hypertension):**  Oral minoxidil dosage for hypertension is determined individually by a physician and depends on the patient's blood pressure and response to treatment. Itâ€™s generally started at a low dose and gradually increased as needed.  This route of administration is significantly less common now and only used in specific circumstances under strict medical supervision.  Oral minoxidil is typically not prescribed for children.

**Important Note:**  There is no pediatric dosage for topical minoxidil specifically for hair loss.  Its use in children for this indication is generally not recommended.

### Side Effects

**Topical (Hair Loss):**

* Irritation at the application site (itching, redness, burning)
* Unwanted hair growth on the face or other body areas
* Scalp dryness or flaking
* Dizziness
* Headaches

**Oral (Hypertension):**

* Fluid retention (edema)
* Rapid weight gain
* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Increased heart rate
* Breast enlargement (gynecomastia) in men
* Hair growth (hirsutism)
* Nausea


**Serious (but less common) side effects (both topical and oral):**  These require immediate medical attention.  Contact your doctor if you experience chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, or severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).

**Always consult your doctor if you experience any adverse effects.**


### How it Works
**For hair loss:** The exact mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth isn't fully understood, but it's believed to prolong the growth phase of the hair cycle and increase blood flow to the hair follicles.

**For hypertension:** Minoxidil acts as a vasodilator, meaning it opens up blood vessels, reducing resistance to blood flow and thereby lowering blood pressure. It does this by affecting the opening and closing of potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of topical minoxidil during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor. The oral form is generally avoided in pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus.
* **Heart conditions:**  Individuals with heart conditions, especially those with a rapid heart rate or fluid retention problems, should use caution and consult a physician before using oral minoxidil.
* **Other medications:** Minoxidil can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Allergies:** If you have any known allergies, discuss them with your doctor before using minoxidil.
* **Topical Application:** Avoid contact with the eyes, and wash your hands after application.  Do not use more than the recommended dosage.
