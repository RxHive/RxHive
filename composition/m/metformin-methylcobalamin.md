# Metformin + Methylcobalamin
### Generic Name
Metformin + Methylcobalamin

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in individuals who also exhibit signs of vitamin B12 deficiency.  Metformin works by decreasing the amount of glucose your liver produces and improving your body's sensitivity to insulin, thus helping regulate blood sugar levels.  Methylcobalamin is a form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function and the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats.  Including it addresses potential B12 deficiency often seen in patients with type 2 diabetes, further supporting metabolic health and potentially mitigating some diabetic neuropathies (nerve damage).  While the primary use is for managing type 2 diabetes in conjunction with B12 support, some healthcare providers may prescribe it off-label based on the individual patient's needs, considering the individual benefits of each component.  This should always be done under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on individual patient factors like age, weight, kidney function, overall health, and the severity of both diabetes and B12 deficiency.  *Always follow your doctor's prescription instructions precisely.*  There isn't a standardized single dose for this combination as the metformin and methylcobalamin are often prescribed as separate medications, titrated individually to achieve optimal results.

**Metformin:**  Dosage for oral metformin tablets typically starts low and is gradually increased.  It can range from 500mg to 2550mg per day, divided into multiple doses.  Extended-release formulations allow for once or twice-daily dosing. Pediatric use requires careful consideration and is often based on weight and clinical response.  IV administration of metformin is not typically used.

**Methylcobalamin:** Dosage for oral methylcobalamin varies, depending on the level of deficiency.  It's commonly prescribed in doses ranging from 500 mcg to 1500 mcg daily, or as determined by blood tests.  Injections (IM or subcutaneous) may be used in cases of severe deficiency, with dosage and frequency determined by a physician.  Pediatric dosages are adjusted for age and weight.

**Important Note:** The combined dosage of Metformin + Methylcobalamin will be individualized by your doctor, considering your needs and tolerance for each component.  Never self-adjust dosages.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Metformin):**

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain)
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Vitamin B12 deficiency (long-term use)
* Lactic acidosis (rare but serious)

**Common Side Effects (Methylcobalamin):**

* Generally well-tolerated, but some individuals may experience mild side effects such as:
* Flushing
* Itching
* Mild allergic reactions (rash)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (Both):**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Symptoms of lactic acidosis (weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, unusual breathing)
* Severe gastrointestinal symptoms
* Any new or worsening neurological symptoms


### How it Works

**Metformin:** Improves insulin sensitivity and reduces glucose production by the liver. It does not stimulate insulin release from the pancreas.

**Methylcobalamin:**  A form of vitamin B12 that is crucial for various metabolic processes, including carbohydrate and fat metabolism. It is essential for nerve function and maintaining healthy myelin sheaths around nerves. This aspect is important in mitigating the risk of diabetic neuropathy often associated with type 2 diabetes.  By addressing B12 deficiency, it contributes to overall metabolic health and potentially improves nerve function.

### Precautions

* **Kidney Disease:** Metformin is contraindicated in individuals with severe kidney disease or those with a history of lactic acidosis.  Kidney function must be monitored regularly when using metformin.
* **Liver Disease:** Caution is advised in individuals with liver disease.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol intake increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin.
* **Surgery:** Metformin may need to be stopped temporarily before and after surgery.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Metformin is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, methylcobalamin's effects during these periods require individual assessment. Consult your doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Metformin can interact with several other medications. Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be at increased risk for lactic acidosis and other side effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Children:**  Dosage must be carefully adjusted to the child's weight and clinical condition.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication if my blood sugar improves?** A: No, never stop or change your dosage without consulting your doctor.
