# Mavacamten
### Generic Name
Mavacamten

### Usage
Mavacamten is a prescription medication used to treat adults with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  This means it's used for adults with HCM who are experiencing symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain that impact their daily lives (classified as New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II-III). Its primary use is to improve functional capacity – meaning the ability to perform physical activities – and reduce the severity of symptoms.  It works by targeting the underlying mechanism of HCM, rather than just treating the symptoms.

### Dosage

Mavacamten is administered orally as a capsule.  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's response to treatment, as assessed by echocardiograms (ECHO) monitoring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient.  There's no single recommended dose; instead, the physician will follow a specific titration algorithm to determine the right dose for each patient.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Initiation:** Treatment typically begins with a low dose of 5mg once daily.
* **Titration:**  The dose is adjusted (increased or decreased) in 2.5mg increments at 4-week intervals.  The goal is to find the lowest effective dose that manages symptoms while maintaining a safe LVEF (typically above 50%).
* **Monitoring:** Regular echocardiograms are crucial to monitor LVEF and LVOT gradient and guide dose adjustments. Treatment may need to be interrupted if LVEF falls below 50%.
* **Maintenance:** Once an effective dose is found, the patient will continue on this maintenance dose.  However, regular monitoring is still necessary.
* **Interruption:** Treatment may need to be temporarily or permanently stopped depending on the LVEF and other clinical factors. The physician will provide guidance on when and how to restart the medication if necessary.
* **Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of Mavacamten have not been established in children.


The detailed titration algorithm involves a series of adjustments based on the patient’s LVEF and LVOT gradient at weeks 4, 8, and 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter. This algorithm is complex and should be managed under a physician's direct supervision.  The information above provides a general overview; precise dosage instructions must be obtained from a prescribing physician and strictly followed.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Dizziness

**Less Common but Important Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Syncope (fainting)
* Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) – a measure of how effectively the heart pumps blood


**Serious Side Effects:** Mavacamten can cause heart failure.  This is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.  Regular monitoring of LVEF is essential to detect and manage this risk.  Other serious side effects are possible, so it's crucial to report any unusual or concerning symptoms to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Mavacamten is a cardiac myosin inhibitor.  In simple terms, it works by affecting the proteins (myosin) responsible for the heart muscle's contraction.  By inhibiting myosin, it reduces the force of contraction, which can help alleviate the symptoms of obstructive HCM by reducing the obstruction in the outflow tract of the heart and improving its ability to fill with blood.  It helps to restore more normal heart function without significantly reducing the overall ability of the heart to pump blood.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Mavacamten may harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for four months after the last dose.
* **Breastfeeding:** The safety of Mavacamten during breastfeeding is unknown.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Dose adjustments may be needed for patients with moderate to severe liver or kidney disease; consult your doctor.
* **Drug Interactions:** Mavacamten interacts with certain other medications.  Tell your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Specifically, certain CYP450 enzyme inhibitors and inducers are contraindicated.
* **Heart Failure Risk:** Mavacamten can cause heart failure, which is why close monitoring of LVEF is crucial.  Patients with a low LVEF at baseline are not typically candidates for this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long will I need to take Mavacamten?** A:  The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your individual response and ongoing monitoring.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never take two doses at once.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Mavacamten?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor, as alcohol may interact with the medication or exacerbate the underlying condition.
* **Q: How should I store Mavacamten?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What are the early signs of heart failure I should watch for?** A: These can include shortness of breath, swelling in the legs or ankles, unusual fatigue, and persistent cough.  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of these.
