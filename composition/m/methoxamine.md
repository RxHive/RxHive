# Methoxamine
### Generic Name
Methoxamine

### Usage

Methoxamine is a medication primarily used to treat hypotensive states (low blood pressure), particularly those occurring during anesthesia. Its primary action is to raise blood pressure.  It achieves this by directly stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This increases peripheral resistance and consequently elevates blood pressure. A secondary, albeit important, use is in the management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), a type of rapid heart rhythm.  In this context, methoxamine's effect on blood pressure helps to modulate the heart's electrical activity and potentially terminate the arrhythmia.  However, it's crucial to understand that methoxamine is typically administered intravenously or intramuscularly in a controlled medical setting, and is not intended for self-medication or home use.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition and the severity of hypotension or tachycardia.  Always follow a healthcare provider's instructions.

* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** For mild to moderate hypotension, 5-10mg intramuscularly (IM) may be administered. For severe hypotension, 3-5mg intravenously (IV) is given as a slow injection.  An IM dose can supplement the IV injection for a longer-lasting effect.  Wait approximately 15 minutes before repeating a dose.
* **Hypotension Prophylaxis during Anesthesia:**  10-15mg IM is typically given shortly before or with spinal anesthesia.  Higher doses (up to 20mg) may be needed depending on the depth of anesthesia. Again, a 15-minute interval should be observed between doses.
* **Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT):** 10mg IV is administered slowly over 3-5 minutes.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of methoxamine in children have not been established. It should not be used in pediatric patients unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare provider should carefully consider the patient's overall health and the severity of the condition before determining appropriate dosing in these cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Anxiety
* Feeling of coldness (due to piloerection - hair standing on end)
* Urinary urgency
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Ventricular ectopic beats (irregular heartbeats)
* Reflex bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Fetal bradycardia (slow fetal heart rate, if used during pregnancy)
* Uterine hypertonus (increased uterine muscle tone)

Less common but more serious side effects are possible.  Any concerning side effects warrant immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Methoxamine is a direct-acting alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist. This means it directly stimulates alpha-1 receptors located on blood vessels.  Stimulating these receptors causes the blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction), which increases resistance to blood flow. This increased resistance leads to a rise in blood pressure.  In the case of PSVT, this increased blood pressure can indirectly help to influence the heart's electrical activity and potentially help to terminate the arrhythmia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methoxamine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or any of its components, and in patients with severe hypertension.
* **Increased Risk:** Methoxamine can increase the risk of hypertension and bradycardia (slow heart rate), especially reflex bradycardia.
* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, bradycardia, myocardial disease, partial heart block, severe arteriosclerosis, poor left ventricular function, pre-existing vulvar disease, and sulfite sensitivity (particularly in asthmatic individuals).  Caution is also warranted in breastfeeding women because the excretion of methoxamine in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:** Methoxamine's pressor effects can be potentiated (enhanced) when used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), vasopressin, ergot alkaloids, sympathomimetic decongestants, appetite suppressants, and amphetamine-like psychostimulants.
* **Pregnancy:** Methoxamine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risks to a developing fetus are not fully known.  It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take methoxamine at home?** A: No. Methoxamine is administered intravenously or intramuscularly by healthcare professionals in a medical setting. It is not intended for self-administration.

* **Q: How should I store methoxamine?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Generally, medications should be stored as directed on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Methoxamine is usually administered in a hospital or clinical setting, and dosing is carefully managed by healthcare professionals. If you have any questions or concerns, consult your doctor or nurse.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of methoxamine?** A: Methoxamine is typically used for short-term treatment of specific conditions.  The long-term effects are not typically considered unless repeated administration is necessary, which should be determined by a physician.

* **Q: Can methoxamine be used for other conditions besides hypotension and PSVT?** A: No. Its use is specifically indicated for these two conditions.  Using it for other purposes is not recommended and may be dangerous.
