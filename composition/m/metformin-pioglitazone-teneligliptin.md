# Metformin + Pioglitazone + Teneligliptin

It's important to note that there is **no single, commercially available generic combination drug containing Metformin, Pioglitazone, and Teneligliptin.**  These three medications are often prescribed together, but separately, to manage type 2 diabetes.  Pharmaceutical companies don't typically create a triple-combination pill due to complexities in formulation and potential for increased side effect risks.  A physician would prescribe these three drugs individually, allowing for precise dosage adjustments for each patient.

Therefore, providing details in the requested format for a nonexistent "Metformin + Pioglitazone + Teneligliptin" combination would be inaccurate.  However, we can provide information about each drug individually:

**Metformin:**

* **Generic Name:** Metformin
* **Usage:**  Treats type 2 diabetes by decreasing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat tissue.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, metallic taste, vitamin B12 deficiency (long-term use).  Lactic acidosis (rare but serious).
* **How it Works:**  Biguanide class; primarily works by reducing hepatic glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity.
* **FAQs:**  Can I take it with food? (Yes, usually with a meal to reduce GI upset).  What are the signs of lactic acidosis? (Muscle pain, weakness, unusual tiredness, difficulty breathing).


**Pioglitazone:**

* **Generic Name:** Pioglitazone
* **Usage:** Treats type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle, fat, and liver tissue.
* **Side Effects:** Fluid retention (edema), weight gain, increased risk of fractures, heart failure, bladder cancer (potential risk).
* **How it Works:** Thiazolidinedione (TZD) class; works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³).
* **FAQs:** Does it cause weight gain? (Yes, often).  Should I be concerned about bladder cancer? (Discuss risk factors with your doctor).


**Teneligliptin:**

* **Generic Name:** Teneligliptin
* **Usage:** Treats type 2 diabetes by increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas in response to glucose and decreasing the production of glucagon.
* **Side Effects:**  Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), pancreatitis (rare but serious).
* **How it Works:** DPP-4 inhibitor; increases incretin levels, which stimulate insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion.
* **FAQs:** Can it cause low blood sugar? (Yes, especially if combined with other diabetes medications).  How does it differ from other DPP-4 inhibitors? (Similar mechanism, but potential differences in side effect profiles exist).


**Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before starting, stopping, or changing any medication, including those used to treat diabetes.** They can assess your individual needs and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan.  Self-treating can be dangerous.
