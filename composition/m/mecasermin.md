# Mecasermin
### Generic Name
Mecasermin

### Usage
Mecasermin is a recombinant form of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).  Its primary use is to treat growth failure in children aged 2 years and older.  Specifically, it's indicated for children with severe primary IGF-1 deficiency or those with growth hormone (GH) gene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to GH.  It's crucial to understand that mecasermin is *not* a substitute for growth hormone in its approved indications.  It addresses the underlying deficiency of IGF-1, which is often the cause of growth failure in these specific patient populations.

### Dosage
**Mecasermin has not been studied in adults.**

**Pediatric Dosage (Children aged ≥ 2 years):**  The drug is administered subcutaneously (subQ).

* **Primary IGF-1 deficiency growth failure:** The initial dose is typically 0.04-0.08 mg/kg (40-80 mcg/kg) twice daily (BID). If well-tolerated for at least a week, the dose may be increased by 0.04 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 0.12 mg/kg BID.  Dosage is highly individualized, requiring close monitoring and adjustment by a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment in children.

### Side Effects
Mecasermin can cause a range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity:

**Common Side Effects (≥10%):**

* Tonsillar hypertrophy (enlarged tonsils)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Development of antibodies to mecasermin


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Hypoglycemic seizures, loss of consciousness, dizziness, headache, seizures, intracranial hypertension
* Heart murmurs
* Snoring
* Vomiting
* Ear problems (fluid in the ear, hearing loss, ear pain, middle ear infection)
* Bruising and lipoatrophy (loss of fat tissue) at the injection site
* Joint pain and limb pain
* Severe hypoglycemia
* Thymus hypertrophy (enlarged thymus gland)

**Rare Side Effects (<1% or post-marketing reports):**

* Cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), heart valve disease
* Thickening of facial soft tissues
* High cholesterol and triglycerides
* Increased liver enzyme levels
* Progression of scoliosis (curvature of the spine)
* Various allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria)
* Hair changes (alopecia, abnormal texture)
* Bone problems (avascular necrosis, osteonecrosis, slipped capital femoral epiphysis)

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Mecasermin replaces the body's missing or deficient IGF-1.  IGF-1 is a hormone crucial for growth and development.  Normally, growth hormone (GH) stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1, which then interacts with receptors in various tissues to promote growth. In patients with primary IGF-1 deficiency or GH gene deletion with neutralizing antibodies to GH, this process is disrupted. Mecasermin directly provides IGF-1, bypassing the malfunctioning pathway and promoting growth.  It also influences glucose metabolism, similar to insulin.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Mecasermin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, closed epiphyses (growth plates), active malignancy, a history of malignancy, and in neonates or premature babies (due to the presence of benzyl alcohol in the formulation). Intravenous administration is also contraindicated.
* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of facial soft tissue thickening, hypersensitivity reactions, hypoglycemia, intracranial hypertension, lymphoid tissue hypertrophy (with potential complications), slipped capital femoral epiphysis, scoliosis progression, malignancy, and gasping syndrome.
* **Interactions:**  Mecasermin can interact with medications that affect growth hormone (e.g., macimorelin, pegvisomant), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), prothionamide, and antidiabetic agents. Close monitoring is necessary when combining these medications.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Mecasermin is a Category C drug during pregnancy.  The decision to breastfeed while using mecasermin should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits of breastfeeding against the potential risk of infant exposure to the drug.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is Mecasermin administered?** A: It's given subcutaneously (under the skin) and should be administered within 20 minutes of a meal or snack. Injection sites should be rotated.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If a patient cannot eat, the dose should be omitted and not made up.

* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Mecasermin?** A:  Avoid high-risk activities for 2-3 hours after dosing, especially during initial treatment and dose adjustments, as hypoglycemia is a potential side effect.

* **Q: How should I store Mecasermin?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Generally, refrigeration is necessary.

* **Q:  Is Mecasermin suitable for all types of growth disorders?** A: No, it's specifically for severe primary IGF-1 deficiency or GH gene deletion with neutralizing antibodies to GH.  It’s not suitable for other causes of growth failure.

* **Q: What monitoring is needed while on Mecasermin?**  A: Regular monitoring of growth, blood glucose levels, for any signs of hypersensitivity or other side effects and periodic funduscopic examinations are essential.
