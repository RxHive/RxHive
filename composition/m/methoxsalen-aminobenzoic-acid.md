# Methoxsalen + Aminobenzoic Acid
### Generic Name
Methoxsalen + Aminobenzoic Acid (Combination)


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used in the treatment of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition characterized by itchy, scaly patches.  It's a photochemotherapy treatment, meaning it requires exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light after application.  Methoxsalen, a psoralen derivative, makes the skin more sensitive to UV light. Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) acts as a sunscreen, offering some protection against sunburn and helping to manage the intensity of the UV light reaction. The combined effect helps to slow the rapid skin cell growth that causes psoriasis. While primarily used for psoriasis, this combination might be considered in some cases of vitiligo (a condition causing loss of skin color), but this is less common.  The treatment is typically administered under strict medical supervision due to the involvement of UV light exposure.


### Dosage

Dosage of Methoxsalen + Aminobenzoic Acid varies significantly depending on the severity of the psoriasis, the patient's skin type, and the type of UV light source used (either UVA or UVB).  There is no standardized dosage for children or adults in oral or IV forms as this combination is applied topically.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose and treatment plan based on an individual's needs.  It's crucial to follow the doctor's instructions precisely.  Typically, the cream or lotion is applied to affected skin areas, followed by controlled exposure to UV light at a clinic under the supervision of a medical professional. The timing of application and UV exposure is essential for efficacy and safety and must be carefully followed. Self-administration is not recommended.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Skin redness, burning, itching, and mild sunburns are common.  These usually resolve after the treatment session.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:** Increased risk of skin cancer with prolonged or excessive use; premature aging of the skin; nausea; vomiting; headache; eye irritation; photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).
* **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe sunburn, blistering, skin discoloration,  and allergic reactions.  Any unusual skin reactions or significant side effects warrant immediate medical attention.

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects may occur.  Always consult your doctor if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works

Methoxsalen is a photosensitizing agent. When applied to the skin and followed by exposure to UV light, it increases the skin's sensitivity to UV radiation. This increased sensitivity triggers a photochemical reaction that modifies the growth rate of skin cells involved in psoriasis.  This helps to reduce the inflammation and scaling associated with the disease. Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) acts as a sunscreen, helping to moderate the effects of the UV light and minimizing the risk of severe sunburn or other adverse effects from the increased light sensitivity.  The combined action of these two ingredients helps to control the abnormal skin cell growth in psoriasis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should not be used in individuals with a known allergy to methoxsalen, PABA, or any other ingredients in the formulation.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should generally avoid this treatment unless specifically advised otherwise by a physician due to the potential risks to the fetus or infant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication can interact with certain other drugs. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are currently taking.
* **Warnings:**  Avoid direct sunlight exposure for several hours after treatment. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen. Protect your eyes with UV-blocking sunglasses during and after treatment sessions. Individuals with a history of skin cancer or severe sunburns should exercise extreme caution and discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider before using this therapy. Regular monitoring of the skin is crucial throughout the treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment usually last?** A: The duration of treatment varies, depending on the severity of the psoriasis and the individual's response to therapy. It's determined by your physician.
* **Q: Is this treatment safe for children?** A:  It's generally not recommended for children unless under the strict supervision of a specialist due to the risk of long-term skin damage.
* **Q: Can I use this medication without UV light exposure?** A: No. This combination therapy requires UV light exposure to be effective; using it without light exposure won't provide the desired therapeutic outcome.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a treatment session?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance. Do not attempt to adjust the treatment schedule without consulting them.
