# Meclocycline
### Generic Name
Meclocycline

### Usage
Meclocycline is a topical antibiotic belonging to the tetracycline family.  Its primary use is in the treatment of acne vulgaris (common acne) and superficial bacterial skin infections. It's currently under investigation for potential use in treating ulcerative oral mucositis (inflammation and ulceration of the mouth lining), though this is not yet a standard application.  The medication is applied directly to the affected skin area.

### Dosage
**Acne vulgaris and superficial skin infections (Topical):**

* **Cream (10 mg/g):** Apply a thin film to the affected skin area 2-4 times daily. Gently rub it in. Treatment should generally not exceed 10 days.  Specific application instructions may vary slightly depending on the brand and formulation. Always follow the instructions provided on your specific Meclocycline product packaging.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance if you have impaired liver or kidney function.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Burning sensation
* Itching
* Redness
* Skin irritation
* Contact allergy (allergic reaction at the application site)
* Yellowing of the skin (a rare but important side effect)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or worsening symptoms, discontinue use and seek medical attention immediately.


### How it Works
Meclocycline is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria rather than killing them directly. It achieves this by binding to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits within susceptible bacteria. This interference disrupts bacterial protein synthesis, preventing their replication and growth.  Additionally, it can alter bacterial cytoplasmic membranes.  By targeting bacterial protein synthesis and cell membranes, Meclocycline effectively combats the infection at the site of application.


### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Meclocycline is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to meclocycline, other tetracyclines, or any components of the formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of meclocycline during pregnancy has not been fully established.  Use during pregnancy should be limited to small areas of skin (less than 10 cmÂ²) and only after careful consideration by a healthcare professional. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.  Breastfeeding may need to be discontinued if large skin areas are treated regularly, to avoid potential risks to the infant.  Avoid contact between the infant and treated skin areas.
* **Interactions:** Meclocycline can interact with various medications, including antacids, bile acid sequestrants, calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc salts,  multi-vitamins/minerals, neuromuscular-blocking agents, penicillins, retinoic acid derivatives, sodium picosulfate, typhoid vaccine, and vitamin K antagonists. These interactions may decrease the effectiveness of meclocycline or other medications or increase the risk of side effects. Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Other Precautions:**  Meclocycline is for topical use only; avoid contact with eyes.  Discard the tube after 4 weeks of opening. Avoid bandages over the application site, as this can increase skin irritation. Limit sun exposure during treatment.  Meclocycline is not suitable for treating infections caused by staphylococci and enterococci due to high resistance rates.
