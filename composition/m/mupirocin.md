# Mupirocin
### Generic Name
Mupirocin

### Usage
Mupirocin is an antibiotic cream or ointment used topically to treat bacterial skin infections.  Its primary use is in treating impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection, caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes*. It's also effective against secondarily infected skin lesions, such as wounds, burns, or dermatitis, caused by these bacteria.  Importantly, mupirocin is used intranasally (in the nose) to eliminate *Staphylococcus aureus* colonization, including the dangerous methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA), particularly in high-risk settings like hospitals or during outbreaks.  While not a typical use,  it may also be employed off-label for conditions like folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles) and nasal vestibulitis (inflammation of the nasal vestibule).  Use for these off-label indications should be discussed with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the form of mupirocin used (ointment or cream).  

**Adults:**

* **Impetigo:** Apply mupirocin ointment (2%) to the affected area three times daily (TID). Re-evaluate after 3-5 days; if no improvement is seen, consult a doctor.
* **Secondary skin infections:** Apply mupirocin cream or ointment (2%) to the affected area twice daily (BID) or TID for up to 10 days. Re-evaluate after 3-5 days.
* **MRSA decolonization (intranasal):** Apply half the contents of a single-use 1g tube of mupirocin ointment (2%) into each nostril twice daily (BID) for 5-10 days. This is often used in conjunction with a skin antiseptic wash.
* **Off-label uses (folliculitis, nasal vestibulitis):** Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and severity, usually involving topical application TID for several days.  Consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosing and duration.

**Children:**

* **Impetigo (≥2 months old):** Dosage is the same as for adults.
* **Secondary skin infections (≥3 months old):** Dosage is the same as for adults.
* **MRSA decolonization (≥12 years old):** Dosage is the same as for adults.

**Important Note:** Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  The information above is for general guidance only.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and localized:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin rash

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, swelling)
* Superinfections (new infections caused by other bacteria or fungi)
*  Gastrointestinal issues (nausea)


If any side effects occur, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Mupirocin is a topical antibiotic that works by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis.  Specifically, it binds to bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for bacterial growth. This binding prevents the enzyme from functioning correctly, ultimately stopping the bacteria from producing the proteins they need to survive and reproduce. This mechanism effectively targets and kills bacteria responsible for skin infections.

### Precautions
* **Allergy:** Do not use mupirocin if you are allergic to it or any of its components.
* **Renal impairment:** Use with caution in patients with kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Mupirocin is a Category B drug during pregnancy, meaning studies in animals have not shown risk to the fetus, but human studies are lacking. The decision to breastfeed while using mupirocin should be made in consultation with a doctor, weighing the risks and benefits. Avoid applying to breasts and nipples before breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure.
* **Children:**  Mupirocin should be used with caution in very young children due to potential absorption through the skin.
* **Superinfection:** Prolonged use can increase the risk of fungal or bacterial superinfections.  Monitor closely for any signs of new infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although rare, mupirocin may interact with other medications. Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take for mupirocin to work?**  A: Improvement is usually seen within a few days, but the full course of treatment should be completed, as directed by your healthcare professional.

* **Q: Can I use mupirocin on open wounds?** A: It can be used on some types of open wounds, but only under the direction of a doctor.  The appropriateness will depend on the type and severity of the wound and the presence of infection.

* **Q: Can I use mupirocin for acne?** A: Mupirocin is not typically used to treat acne; other treatments are more suitable.

* **Q: How should I store mupirocin?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct heat and light. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is mupirocin safe for long-term use?**  A:  Prolonged use increases the risk of side effects and the development of resistant bacteria.  Long-term use should only be considered under the close supervision of a doctor.
