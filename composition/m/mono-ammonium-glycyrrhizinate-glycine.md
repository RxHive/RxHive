# Mono Ammonium Glycyrrhizinate + Glycine
### Generic Name

Mono Ammonium Glycyrrhizinate + Glycine


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat liver diseases, specifically those characterized by impaired liver function and elevated liver enzyme levels.  Mono ammonium glycyrrhizinate (MAG) is the active component derived from licorice root, possessing hepatoprotective (liver-protective) properties. Glycine acts as a supporting agent, potentially aiding in detoxification processes within the liver.  While primarily used for liver conditions, it may also be employed in cases of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and other liver-related ailments where improved liver function is desired.  It's important to note that this is not a cure for liver disease but rather a supportive therapy aimed at improving liver health and mitigating some of the symptoms associated with compromised liver function.  The effectiveness and suitability of this medication must always be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual patient's condition and medical history.


### Dosage

Dosage regimens for Mono Ammonium Glycyrrhizinate + Glycine vary significantly depending on the specific formulation, the severity of the liver condition, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.  There is no standardized universally applicable dosage.  A physician will determine the appropriate dose and duration of treatment based on a thorough assessment of the individual patient's needs.  Information regarding specific dosage instructions should always be obtained directly from the prescribing physician or pharmacist.  Oral administration is common, but different dosage forms may exist (tablets, capsules, etc.).  Intravenous administration is generally not used for this combination.  **Never attempt to self-medicate or alter the prescribed dosage without explicit guidance from your doctor.**


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), headache, dizziness, mild allergic reactions (rash, itching).
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), fluid retention (edema), changes in blood pressure, increased potassium levels (hyperkalemia).  While rare, these side effects warrant immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Mono ammonium glycyrrhizinate (MAG) is believed to exert its hepatoprotective effects through multiple mechanisms.  It's thought to scavenge harmful free radicals, reduce inflammation within the liver, and promote liver cell regeneration.  Glycine, a naturally occurring amino acid, plays a role in detoxification pathways within the liver, potentially assisting in the removal of harmful substances.  The combined action of MAG and glycine aims to support liver function, reduce liver damage, and improve overall liver health. The precise mechanisms are still under investigation, but the observed clinical benefits suggest a synergistic effect between the two components.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This combination should be avoided in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to either mono ammonium glycyrrhizinate or glycine.  Caution is necessary in patients with kidney disease due to the potential for fluid retention.
* **Drug Interactions:**  This medication may interact with other drugs, particularly those affecting potassium levels or blood pressure.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for children and older adults.  A physician should carefully assess the patient's condition and determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see improvement varies greatly depending on the individual and the severity of the liver condition.  It's crucial to continue treatment as directed by your doctor and follow-up regularly for monitoring.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication if I feel better?** A:  No, never stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly might negatively impact your liver health.
