While both ingredients have individual uses, their combined use isn't a standard pharmaceutical formulation.  Information below is based on the individual properties of each component and should *not* be interpreted as information on a specific combined drug product.  **Always consult a healthcare professional before using any medication.**

**Generic Name:**  There is no single generic name for a combination of Mono Ammonium Glycyrrhizinate and Glycine as it is not a standard pharmaceutical preparation.

It's been studied for treating chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and certain allergic conditions.  It's often used in some countries as an ingredient in herbal remedies.

* **Glycine:** A non-essential amino acid with various applications. It has a role in protein synthesis, acts as a neurotransmitter, and may have some antioxidant and detoxifying properties.  It's used in supplements for various purposes, including improving sleep quality and potentially supporting liver function.
