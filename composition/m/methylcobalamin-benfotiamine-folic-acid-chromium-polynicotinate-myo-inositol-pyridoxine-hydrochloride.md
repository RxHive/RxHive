# Methylcobalamin + Benfotiamine + Folic Acid + Chromium polynicotinate + Myo-Inositol + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride

## Methylcobalamin + Benfotiamine + Folic Acid + Chromium Polynicotinate + Myo-Inositol + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride

**Generic Name:**  This is a combination supplement, so there isn't one single generic name.  The generic names of the individual components are listed above.


**Usage:** This combination supplement is often marketed for supporting nerve health, metabolic function, and blood sugar control.  The specific usage may vary depending on the manufacturer and intended application. It is *not* a treatment for any specific disease but may be used as a supportive therapy in conjunction with medical advice.  Common uses include:

* **Peripheral Neuropathy:**  Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12), benfotiamine (a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1), and pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) are all involved in nerve function and can potentially help alleviate symptoms of neuropathy.
* **Metabolic Syndrome:**  Myo-inositol, chromium polynicotinate (chromium), and benfotiamine may play a role in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.  Folic acid is also important in many metabolic processes.
* **Cognitive Function:** Some proponents suggest that this combination may support cognitive function due to the roles of the vitamins in brain health.

**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge only and does not constitute medical advice.  Always consult a healthcare professional before taking this or any supplement, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or are taking other medications.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and infrequent when taken at recommended doses.  However, possible side effects include:

* **Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin):**  Rarely, high doses can cause nausea, diarrhea, or skin reactions.
* **Benfotiamine:**  Generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects include mild gastrointestinal upset.
* **Folic Acid:**  Usually well-tolerated, but high doses can mask the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency.
* **Chromium Polynicotinate:**  May cause gastrointestinal upset in some individuals.
* **Myo-Inositol:**  Generally well-tolerated, but may cause gastrointestinal upset or headaches.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):**  High doses over a prolonged period can potentially cause nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy).


**How it Works:**  Each component contributes differently:

* **Methylcobalamin:**  A bioactive form of vitamin B12 crucial for nerve function and DNA synthesis.
* **Benfotiamine:**  A fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 (thiamine) that improves glucose metabolism and nerve function.
* **Folic Acid:**  Essential for cell growth and DNA synthesis.  Plays a vital role in many metabolic pathways.
* **Chromium Polynicotinate:**  A form of chromium believed to enhance insulin sensitivity.
* **Myo-Inositol:**  A type of sugar alcohol involved in various cellular processes, including insulin signaling.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride:**  A form of vitamin B6 involved in nerve function, neurotransmitter synthesis, and many metabolic processes.
