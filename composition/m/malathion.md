# Malathion
### Generic Name
Malathion

### Usage
Malathion is primarily used as a pediculicide, meaning it's effective in killing head lice ( *Pediculus humanus capitis*) and their eggs (nits).  It's a topical treatment applied directly to the scalp and hair. While its primary use is for head lice infestations, it may sometimes be used off-label for pubic lice ( *Pediculosis pubis*), particularly when other treatments have failed.  However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before using Malathion for pubic lice or any condition other than head lice.

### Dosage

**Head Lice ( *Pediculus humanus capitis*)**

Dosage varies depending on the Malathion formulation (lotion, liquid, or foam) and the patient's age.  Always follow the instructions on the product label carefully.

* **Adults and Children ≥ 6 years:**  Dosage instructions vary across formulations.  Lotions and liquids typically involve applying enough to thoroughly saturate dry hair and scalp, leaving it on for 8-12 hours (often overnight), then shampooing.  Foam formulations may require a shorter application time (30 minutes) after lathering. A second application may be necessary after 7-9 days if live lice persist.

* **Children 2-5 years:** The dosage is generally the same as for older children but should always be given under direct adult supervision and following the specific instructions on the label.  Malathion is generally only considered for this age group if other treatments have been ineffective.

* **Infants (< 6 years):** Malathion is generally not recommended for infants under 6 months old.  Always consult a doctor before administering to young children.

**Pubic Lice ( *Pediculosis pubis*)** (Off-label use)

For pubic lice, treatment involves applying the lotion or liquid to the affected area(s), leaving it on for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight), and then washing it off. A second application after 7 days might be necessary.  This off-label use should only be considered under the strict guidance of a physician.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Skin irritation (including scalp irritation), stinging sensation at the application site.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), eye irritation (conjunctivitis – if it gets in the eyes), and in rare cases, more serious systemic effects (though very rare with topical application).

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse reaction, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide. It works by inhibiting cholinesterase, an enzyme vital to the nervous system of lice. By blocking cholinesterase activity, Malathion disrupts the nerve impulses in lice, leading to their paralysis and death.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Malathion should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Malathion or any components of the formulation. It is contraindicated in neonates and infants.
* **Drug Interactions:** Malathion can interact with certain medications such as beta-blockers, cholinergic agonists, corticosteroids, and neuromuscular-blocking agents. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Malathion is classified as a Category B drug during pregnancy.  While the risk to the fetus is considered low, it’s important to consult your doctor.  Whether it’s excreted in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Children and Older Adults:** Use caution when applying Malathion to young children and older adults. Ensure to carefully follow the dosage instructions and monitor them for any side effects.
* **Flammable:** Malathion lotion is flammable; avoid open flames or heat sources (e.g., hair dryers) during and after application. Do not smoke during or after treatment.
