# Meclizine + Caffeine

**Generic Name:** Meclizine Hydrochloride + Caffeine

**Usage:**

This combination medication is used to treat symptoms of motion sickness, such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.  Caffeine is added to enhance the effectiveness of meclizine. It's typically taken before anticipated exposure to motion (e.g., before a car, boat, or plane trip).  It can also be used to treat vertigo (a spinning sensation) associated with inner ear problems.  **Important Note:** This is not a first-line treatment for vertigo and should only be used as directed by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a common side effect of meclizine, and caffeine may partially counteract it, but drowsiness can still occur.
* **Dry mouth:**
* **Blurred vision:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Dizziness:**  This can be paradoxical, meaning it can worsen the dizziness it is intended to treat in some individuals.
* **Headache:**  Although caffeine can help headaches, it can also cause them.
* **Restlessness or nervousness (more likely with caffeine):**
* **Insomnia (more likely with caffeine):**
* **Fast heartbeat (palpitations) (more likely with caffeine):**
* **Tremors (more likely with caffeine):**
* **Allergic reactions:**  These are rare but can include rash, itching, or swelling.

**How it Works:**

* **Meclizine:** This is an antihistamine with anticholinergic and antiemetic properties.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the brain, reducing the signals that cause nausea and vomiting.  It also affects the inner ear, helping to reduce vertigo.
* **Caffeine:** This acts as a stimulant, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of meclizine and offsetting some of its sedative effects.  The exact mechanism of caffeine's contribution in this combination is not fully understood.
