# Minoxidil (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Minoxidil (Systemic)

### Usage
Minoxidil (systemic) is a vasodilator primarily used to treat severe or refractory hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children.  This means it's used when blood pressure remains high despite treatment with other medications, such as a diuretic and two other antihypertensive agents at their maximum tolerated doses.  It's crucial to understand that Minoxidil is generally reserved for cases where other treatments have proven ineffective, due to its potential for significant side effects.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  The initial oral dose is typically 5 mg once daily.  This dose is carefully increased every three days, as directed by a physician, until the desired blood pressure is achieved or the maximum dose of 100 mg/day is reached.  The medication may be given once or twice daily, depending on individual response and blood pressure changes. Concomitant therapy with a beta-blocker is usually recommended to counteract potential reflex tachycardia (rapid heartbeat). Dosage adjustments depend on the individual's response and are determined by a healthcare professional.

**Children (under 12):** The starting dose is usually 0.2 mg/kg/dose once daily.  The daily dose may be increased by 50-100% every three days, with the possibility of dividing the dose into multiple administrations throughout the day. The maximum daily dose is 50 mg.

**Children (12 and older):** The initial oral dose is 5 mg once daily, with gradual increases every three days, similar to adult dosing, up to a maximum of 100 mg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are officially recommended for hepatic (liver) impairment; however, caution is advised, and the medication should be introduced gradually.  Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication.  For renal (kidney) impairment, no official adjustments are recommended, but dose reduction may be necessary, especially in patients with renal failure or those undergoing dialysis.  These adjustments should always be made under the close supervision of a healthcare provider.


### Side Effects

**Common:**

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Fluid retention (edema)
*   Weight gain
*   Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
*   Nausea

**Less Common but Serious:**

*   Pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart) â€“ This can progress to cardiac tamponade (a life-threatening condition).
*   Angina pectoris (chest pain)
*   Heart failure
*   Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth)
*   Allergic skin reactions (rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
*   Changes in blood counts (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)


It's vital to seek immediate medical attention if any serious side effects occur.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor or other healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Minoxidil (systemic) works by directly relaxing the smooth muscles in the arterioles (small arteries), causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels).  This reduces the resistance to blood flow, thereby lowering blood pressure.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it may involve the stimulation of cyclic AMP.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Minoxidil is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to minoxidil or related components, pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), pulmonary hypertension associated with mitral stenosis (a heart valve condition), and severe hepatic impairment.

**Interactions:** Minoxidil can interact with other medications, potentially enhancing their hypotensive effects.  This includes other antihypertensives, hypotensives, MAO inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, and prostacyclin analogues.  Close monitoring is essential when minoxidil is used with these medications.

**Warnings:**  Minoxidil can cause serious cardiac effects, including pericardial effusion and angina exacerbation.  It is therefore only used in cases where other antihypertensive therapies have failed.  Careful monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG is necessary.  Salt and water retention are common side effects; a diuretic is often co-prescribed to counter this effect.  Sudden cessation of minoxidil should be avoided.


**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Minoxidil is classified as a Category C drug in pregnancy (meaning potential risks to the fetus exist).  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking minoxidil, as the drug is excreted in breast milk.  Discuss these risks with a healthcare provider before using minoxidil during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.


**Elderly and Vulnerable Populations:**  Elderly patients and those with significant renal impairment may require closer monitoring and potentially lower doses.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for minoxidil to work?**

A: The time it takes to see a therapeutic effect varies; however, it typically takes several weeks to achieve optimal blood pressure control.  Regular monitoring is crucial.

**Q: Can I stop taking minoxidil suddenly?**

A: No. Abrupt discontinuation can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q: How should I store minoxidil?**

A: Store minoxidil at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of the reach of children.

**Q:  Are there any long-term effects of minoxidil?**

A:  Long-term use can be associated with continued risks of the side effects listed above. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential to assess for any long-term effects.
