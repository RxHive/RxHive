# Muromonab
### Generic Name
Muromonab-CD3

### Usage

Muromonab-CD3 is a powerful immunosuppressant medication primarily used to treat acute rejection of transplanted organs.  Specifically, its main use is in patients who have undergone kidney transplants and are experiencing acute rejection.  It's also indicated for treating steroid-resistant acute rejection in heart and liver transplant recipients.  This means it's used when the standard treatment with steroids isn't effective in controlling the rejection episode.  The drug works by targeting and suppressing the activity of certain immune cells involved in the rejection process.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Muromonab-CD3 administration should only be done in a setting equipped for managing serious adverse reactions, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  Pretreatment with methylprednisolone is usually recommended to reduce the risk of severe reactions.  If a patient's temperature exceeds 100°F (37.8°C), antipyretics should be administered before the next dose.

**Adults:**  The typical dose for acute allograft rejection (kidney, heart, or liver) is 5 mg intravenously (IV) daily for 10-14 days.


**Children:** The dosage for children is weight-based for acute allograft rejection:

*   Children weighing less than 30 kg receive 2.5 mg/day IV for 10-14 days.
*   Children weighing more than 30 kg receive 5 mg/day IV for 10-14 days.  The dosage may be adjusted based on blood tests monitoring T-cell counts and Muromonab-CD3 levels to ensure effective treatment while minimizing side effects.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Close monitoring is crucial in these patients.

### Side Effects

Muromonab-CD3 can cause various side effects, some quite serious.  It's essential to seek immediate medical attention if any concerning symptoms develop.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

*   Cytokine release syndrome (within the first 48 hours) – characterized by fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, and other symptoms.
*   Headache
*   Chills
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Chest pain
*   Tremor
*   Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
*   Wheezing
*   Pyrexia (fever)
*   Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Hypertension (high blood pressure)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Seizures
*   Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
*   Cardiovascular collapse
*   Cardiac or respiratory arrest
*   Coma
*   Fatigue
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite)
*   GI pain
*   Arthralgia (joint pain)
*   Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
*   Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)

This is not an exhaustive list, and other side effects are possible.  Consult a healthcare professional if any new or worsening symptoms occur.


### How it Works

Muromonab-CD3 is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD3 protein found on the surface of T lymphocytes.  T lymphocytes are crucial components of the immune system responsible for recognizing and attacking foreign substances, including transplanted organs. By binding to CD3, Muromonab-CD3 blocks the activation and function of these T cells, thus suppressing the immune response that leads to organ rejection.  This allows the transplanted organ a greater chance of survival.

### Precautions

Muromonab-CD3 is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

*   Hypersensitivity to murine-derived products.
*   High anti-mouse antibody titers (≥1:1000).
*   Uncontrolled congestive heart failure or fluid overload.
*   Uncontrolled hypertension.
*   History of seizures.
*   Pregnancy or breastfeeding.


Use caution in patients with:

*   Unstable angina.
*   Recent myocardial infarction.
*   Ischemic heart disease.
*   Heart failure.
*   Pulmonary edema.
*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
*   Vascular overload or depletion.
*   Septic shock.
*   Cerebrovascular disease.
*   Advanced vascular disease or neuropathy.
*   History of thrombotic events or underlying vascular disease.
*   Children with primary Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Muromonab-CD3 can increase the risk of infections, lymphoproliferative neoplasms (cancers of the lymphatic system), and serious cardiovascular and central nervous system events.  It also interacts with other immunosuppressants, potentially increasing toxicity.  It may increase the risk of encephalopathy and CNS effects when used with indomethacin.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Muromonab-CD3 administered?** A: It's given intravenously (IV) as an IV push over less than one minute.  It should not be administered intramuscularly (IM).

*   **Q: How is Muromonab-CD3 stored?** A: Refer to the specific storage instructions on the product packaging.

*   **Q: Are there any specific monitoring requirements?** A: Yes, close monitoring of Muromonab-CD3 levels, T-cell counts, and vital signs is essential, especially during the initial doses.  Regular blood tests to assess organ function are also needed.

*   **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Muromonab-CD3?** A:  No. Muromonab-CD3 may impair mental alertness and coordination.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor immediately to determine the appropriate course of action.

*   **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately, especially if you experience serious side effects.
