# Methdilazine + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate

There is no standard or widely recognized combination drug containing Methdilazine, Ammonium Chloride, and Sodium Citrate.  These three ingredients have distinct uses and are not typically prescribed together.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide details on a "generic Methdilazine + Ammonium Chloride + Sodium Citrate" combination.

To get accurate information, you need to specify the brand name of a medication or provide the full list of ingredients in a particular prescription.  Each ingredient has its own properties:

* **Methdilazine:** This is an antihistamine, primarily used to treat allergic reactions and itching.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** This is an expectorant, often used to help loosen and thin mucus in the respiratory tract. It's also sometimes used to treat metabolic alkalosis.
* **Sodium Citrate:** This is a buffering agent, often used to adjust the pH of solutions or medications.  It's also used as a urinary alkalinizer.

Combining these ingredients without a specific formulation would be inappropriate and dangerous.  Consult a pharmacist or doctor if you have questions about a specific medication or combination of ingredients.
