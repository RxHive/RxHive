# Moclobemide
### Generic Name
Moclobemide

### Usage
Moclobemide is primarily used to treat depression and social anxiety disorder (social phobia).  It's a type of antidepressant that works differently than many other common antidepressants. While its main use is for these conditions, its application may extend to other situations based on a doctor's assessment.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Depression:** The starting dose is typically 300 mg per day, divided into two doses.  This dose may be gradually increased after one week, depending on the patient's response, up to a maximum of 600 mg per day.  The maintenance dose is usually lower, often around 150 mg per day.  Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on individual response and tolerance.  This is always determined in consultation with a physician.

* **Social Phobia:** The initial dose is typically 150 mg twice daily (BID) for three days. This is then often increased to 300 mg BID for 8-12 weeks, and further adjustments are done based on individual response.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of moclobemide in children have not been established, and it's not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with certain conditions.  People with severe liver impairment may require a significantly reduced dose (33-50% of the usual dose).  While there aren't specific guidelines for renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling, caution is advised, and a doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.  Individuals taking cimetidine should also consult their doctor regarding potential dose reduction.  It's crucial to allow a specific time period (ranging from 2 to 5 weeks depending on the previous medication) between discontinuing other antidepressants or MAOIs and starting moclobemide. Similarly, a period should be observed before starting another antidepressant or MAOI after stopping moclobemide.


### Side Effects

* Nervous system: Sleep disturbances (insomnia), agitation, nervousness, restlessness, anxiety.
* Cardiovascular: Palpitations, rapid heart rate (tachycardia), low blood pressure (hypotension).

This is not an exhaustive list.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Moclobemide is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain. By inhibiting MAO-A, moclobemide increases the levels of these neurotransmitters, which are believed to play a significant role in mood regulation. This increased availability of these neurotransmitters is thought to be responsible for its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Moclobemide is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to it or its components; those with acute confusional states; individuals with pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland); and those concurrently using certain medications (including other antidepressants, some pain relievers, and sympathomimetics).

* **Interactions:** Moclobemide can interact with numerous other medications.  Significant interactions can occur with cimetidine, tryptophan, CNS depressants, diuretics, hypotensive agents, other antidepressants, sympathomimetics, and MAOIs.  Concurrent use with these drugs should generally be avoided unless specifically directed by a doctor.

* **Warnings:** Moclobemide should be used cautiously in patients with certain cardiac conditions, bipolar disorder, thyrotoxicosis (overactive thyroid), severe hepatic or renal impairment, and when used with other specific medications.  The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior is higher with antidepressants.  Moclobemide should be discontinued at least 2 days before surgery or any anesthetic procedure.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of moclobemide during pregnancy has not been established, and its use is not recommended in pregnant women or those who may become pregnant. Moclobemide is excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding inadvisable during its use.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I eat or drink anything special while taking moclobemide?** A:  It's best to take moclobemide immediately after meals.  Furthermore, it is advisable to limit the consumption of tyramine-rich foods (aged cheeses, cured meats, some fermented products, etc.) as this may lead to adverse effects.

* **Q: Can I stop taking moclobemide suddenly?** A: No, abrupt withdrawal should be avoided.  Always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.

* **Q: How should I store moclobemide?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Does moclobemide cause weight gain?** A: While weight gain is a potential side effect, it's not consistently reported, and the extent of its occurrence varies among patients.

* **Q: Can I take moclobemide with alcohol?** A: No, combining moclobemide with alcohol is strongly discouraged. Alcohol can potentiate the sedative effects, increasing the risk of adverse events.
