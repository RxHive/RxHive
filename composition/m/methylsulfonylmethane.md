# Methylsulfonylmethane
### Generic Name
Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)

### Usage
Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring organosulfur compound used in complementary and alternative medicine.  While it doesn't have FDA-approved medical uses, research suggests potential benefits in several areas.  The most studied applications are for reducing inflammation and pain associated with osteoarthritis and other joint issues.  Some studies also indicate potential benefits in reducing oxidative stress and improving antioxidant capacity within the body.  However, it's crucial to note that evidence supporting these benefits varies in strength, and further research is needed to confirm efficacy for specific conditions.

### Dosage
There's no universally established dosage for MSM.  The amount used varies depending on the intended use and individual response.  Typical dosages for adults range from 500 mg to 3000 mg per day, often divided into multiple doses.  Specific recommendations should come from a healthcare professional.  Children's dosages haven't been established, and MSM is not recommended for use in children without direct medical supervision.  MSM is available in various forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and creams for topical application.  Always follow the directions provided with your specific product. The FDA considers MSM safe at dosages under 4845.6 mg/day.

### Side Effects
MSM is generally considered well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience:

*   Mild gastrointestinal issues (e.g., diarrhea, nausea)
*   Headaches
*   Skin reactions (e.g., itching, rash)
*   Allergic reactions (rare but possible)

More serious side effects are uncommon. If any significant or concerning side effects develop, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action of MSM is not fully understood.  However, research suggests it may work through several pathways:

* **Anti-inflammatory effects:** MSM may help reduce inflammation by impacting the body's inflammatory response pathways.
* **Antioxidant effects:** MSM might act as an antioxidant, helping to neutralize harmful free radicals and protect cells from damage.
* **Improved cellular function:** Some studies suggest MSM might improve the permeability and function of cell membranes, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption and waste removal.


### Precautions
* **Interactions:** While not widely documented, potential interactions with certain medications are possible. Consult your doctor if you are taking other medications, especially blood thinners or medications that affect blood clotting.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Consult your doctor before using MSM if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Allergies:** Individuals with allergies to sulfur-containing compounds should exercise caution.  
* **Underlying health conditions:** Those with specific health conditions should discuss MSM use with their doctor before starting supplementation, particularly those with kidney or liver problems.
