# Methyl Polysiloxane
### Generic Name
Methyl Polysiloxane

### Usage
Methyl polysiloxane is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with excess gas in the gastrointestinal tract.  This includes conditions causing bloating, flatulence (excessive gas), and discomfort stemming from trapped gas.  While not a treatment for the underlying causes of these symptoms, it effectively alleviates the discomfort they produce.  It's also sometimes used as an antiflatulent agent to help reduce gas buildup after certain medical procedures or surgeries.  It is not indicated for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) itself, but it may provide some relief from associated symptoms like bloating.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation of methyl polysiloxane and the patient's age and condition.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Typical adult dosages range from 40-80mg, taken multiple times a day as needed.  However, many over-the-counter products contain varying amounts, so refer to the product packaging for precise directions.  There is generally limited information regarding pediatric dosing, therefore, it's crucial to consult a pediatrician before administering methyl polysiloxane to children.  The medication is typically available in capsule or liquid form.  For liquid formulations, follow the measuring instructions carefully using the provided dosing device.

### Side Effects
Methyl polysiloxane is generally well-tolerated, and serious side effects are rare.  However, some people may experience:

* Mild stomach upset
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Allergic reactions (in rare cases, potentially serious)


If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Methyl polysiloxane works by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract.  This allows smaller gas bubbles to coalesce into larger ones, making it easier for the gas to be expelled through belching or flatus.  Essentially, it helps the body more efficiently remove trapped gas, thereby relieving associated symptoms like bloating and discomfort.  It does not absorb into the bloodstream to a significant degree, acting primarily within the gastrointestinal tract.
