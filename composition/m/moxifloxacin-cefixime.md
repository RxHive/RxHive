# Moxifloxacin + Cefixime
### Generic Name: Moxifloxacin + Cefixime

This combination is not a single generic medicine with a single approved name.  Moxifloxacin and Cefixime are two distinct antibiotics frequently prescribed *together*, often under a brand name, to treat specific infections where their combined action is beneficial.  It's crucial to understand that the information below applies to the *individual* drugs, not a pre-mixed, single-entity generic.  Always refer to your prescription and consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific dosage and usage instructions regarding a prescribed combination.

### Usage

**Moxifloxacin:** A fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.  Its primary use is in treating community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. It may also be used for skin and skin structure infections.

**Cefixime:** A cephalosporin antibiotic, also with a broad-spectrum activity, primarily effective against Gram-negative bacteria.  Its primary use is in treating various bacterial infections, including urinary tract infections, ear infections (otitis media), and bronchitis.

When used together, Moxifloxacin and Cefixime offer broader coverage against a wider range of bacteria compared to using either antibiotic alone. This combination is typically reserved for severe or complicated infections where a single antibiotic might be insufficient.

### Dosage

Dosage for both Moxifloxacin and Cefixime varies significantly depending on the specific infection, patient age, weight, kidney and liver function, and other medical conditions.  **It is imperative to follow the precise instructions on your prescription label.** There is no single, standardized combined dosage.

**Moxifloxacin:**  Dosage forms include tablets and intravenous infusions. Oral dosages typically range from 400mg once daily to 800mg once or twice daily, depending on the infection. IV dosages are determined by the severity of the infection and patient-specific factors.  

**Cefixime:** Dosage forms include oral capsules and suspension (syrup). Oral dosages are generally 200mg to 400mg once or twice daily, varying by infection and patient factors.  Intravenous Cefixime is also available but less common than the oral form.

**Pediatric Dosages:**  Both Moxifloxacin and Cefixime are generally not recommended for children unless specifically directed by a physician.  The use of fluoroquinolones in children is often restricted due to potential side effects on bone and cartilage development.

### Side Effects

**Moxifloxacin:**
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Abdominal pain
* Insomnia
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Tendinitis (inflammation of the tendons)
* Tendon rupture (rare, but serious)
* Liver enzyme elevation

**Cefixime:**
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Yeast infections (thrush)

**Serious, but less common side effects for both drugs can include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), seizures, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (C. difficile colitis).**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works

**Moxifloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This action leads to bacterial cell death.

**Cefixime:**  Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  This prevents the formation of a functional bacterial cell wall, leading to cell death.

The combined effect provides a synergistic antimicrobial action, meaning the two drugs work together more effectively than individually.

### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Patients with known allergies to fluoroquinolones (Moxifloxacin) or cephalosporins (Cefixime) should not take these antibiotics.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Both Moxifloxacin and Cefixime can interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.
* **Tendon Problems:** Moxifloxacin carries a risk of tendon damage. Individuals with a history of tendon disorders should use caution.
* **Photosensitivity:**  Moxifloxacin can increase sensitivity to sunlight. Use sunscreen and protective clothing when exposed to sunlight.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking these antibiotics when I feel better?**  A: No, complete the entire prescribed course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to treatment failure and the development of antibiotic resistance.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe diarrhea?** A: Severe diarrhea can be a sign of *Clostridium difficile* infection. Contact your doctor immediately.

* **Q: How should I store these medications?** A: Store as directed on the prescription label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q:  Are there any food restrictions while taking these antibiotics?** A:  There are generally no specific food restrictions, but it's best to follow your doctor's advice.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking these antibiotics?** A:  While there aren't direct interactions with alcohol, it's best to avoid alcohol consumption during antibiotic treatment as it may exacerbate side effects like nausea and stomach upset. Always consult your physician.
