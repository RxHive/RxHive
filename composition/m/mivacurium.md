# Mivacurium
### Generic Name
Mivacurium

### Usage

Mivacurium is a short-acting, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.  Its primary use is as an adjunct to general anesthesia. This means it's used alongside other anesthetic medications to facilitate procedures requiring muscle relaxation.  Specifically, it helps with:

* **Tracheal intubation:** Relaxing the muscles of the airway to allow for easier insertion of a breathing tube.
* **Skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery:**  Providing muscle paralysis to allow surgeons to operate without interference from muscle movement.
* **Facilitating mechanical ventilation:** Assisting with breathing support in critically ill patients who are adequately sedated.  This is considered an off-label use in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Mivacurium dosages must be individualized and titrated to the patient's response due to significant variability among individuals. Adequate pain control and sedation should always precede the use of neuromuscular blocking agents.


**Adult Dosage (IV):**

* **Intermittent Bolus (for intubation, surgery, or mechanical ventilation):**
    * Initial dose:  Ranges from 0.15 mg/kg to 0.25 mg/kg, administered over 5-15 seconds or in divided doses (e.g., 0.15 mg/kg followed by 0.1 mg/kg after 30 seconds). Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient factors (see Dosage Adjustments below).
    * Maintenance dose: Typically 0.1 mg/kg at approximately 15-minute intervals, depending on the duration of the procedure and patient response.
* **Continuous Infusion (for intubation, surgery, or mechanical ventilation):**
    * Initial infusion rate:  Ranges from 4-10 mcg/kg/min (0.24-0.6 mg/kg/h), depending on whether it's started simultaneously with the bolus dose.  A lower rate is used if initiated concurrently with a bolus dose.
    * Usual infusion rate: 5-7 mcg/kg/min (0.3-0.42 mg/kg/h) under balanced anesthesia.

* **ICU Paralysis (Off-label):**  For patients needing mechanical ventilation support: Initial bolus of 0.25 mg/kg followed by 5-6 mcg/kg/min (0.3-0.36 mg/kg/h) for up to 48 hours.  This is a high-risk setting, and close monitoring is critical.


**Pediatric Dosage (IV):**

Dosage for children varies significantly based on age and weight.  It's crucial to consult specific pediatric guidelines and adjust the dosage according to the child's response.  Multiple-dose vials containing benzyl alcohol are contraindicated in premature infants. Specific dosing ranges are outlined in the provided source, separated by age groups (2-12 years, adolescents, and infants).  The same principles of intermittent bolus and continuous infusion apply as in adults, but the rates and dosages are lower.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Reduce initial bolus dose to 0.15 mg/kg and subsequent doses based on patient response. Infusion rates may need to be decreased by as much as 50%, depending on the severity of the impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Reduce the initial bolus dose to 0.15 mg/kg and adjust subsequent doses based on the patient's response.
* **Obesity:**  Dose should be calculated based on ideal body weight, not total body weight.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** Flushing (occurs in more than 10% of patients).

**Less Common but Important Side Effects:** Hypotension (occurs in 1-10% of patients),  Anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, bradycardia, bronchospasm, cardiac arrhythmias, delayed recovery from neuromuscular block, dizziness, drug tolerance, erythema, hypersensitivity reaction, hypoxemia, injection-site reaction, muscle spasm, phlebitis, skin rash, tachycardia, urticaria, and wheezing.

**Important:**  If you experience any adverse effects, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Mivacurium is a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine.  It works by binding to the receptors on skeletal muscle cells where acetylcholine normally binds. By blocking acetylcholine, it prevents muscle contraction, leading to paralysis.  The short duration of action is due to its rapid metabolism by plasma cholinesterase.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to mivacurium or any formulation component; use in premature infants (due to benzyl alcohol in multiple-dose vials).
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of severe (even fatal) anaphylactic reactions; potential cross-sensitivity with other neuromuscular blockers.
* **Use with Caution:** In patients with a history of anaphylaxis to neuromuscular blocking agents, clinically significant cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, those homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase, patients with conditions where histamine release is hazardous (e.g., asthma), elderly patients, and breastfeeding women.  
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several drugs can interact with mivacurium, potentially altering its effects. These include cyclophosphamide, echothiophate iodide, estrogen derivatives, metoclopramide, phenelzine, and sertraline.  Monitoring is needed if these medications are used concurrently.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does mivacurium last?** A: Mivacurium is a short-acting drug, with the effects typically lasting for a relatively short time depending on the dosage and patient factors.
* **Q: How is mivacurium administered?** A: It's administered intravenously (IV), either as an intermittent bolus or continuous infusion.
* **Q: Can I store mivacurium at home?** A: No, mivacurium is a prescription medication administered in a hospital or clinical setting under medical supervision.  It is not for home use.
* **Q: What should I do if I have an allergic reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe and life-threatening.
* **Q:  Is mivacurium safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A: Use during pregnancy is only considered if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.  The safety of mivacurium during breastfeeding is not fully established.
