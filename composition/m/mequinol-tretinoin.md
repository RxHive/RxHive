# Mequinol + Tretinoin
### Generic Name
Mequinol + Tretinoin

### Usage
Mequinol and Tretinoin combination is a topical medication primarily used to treat solar lentigines (also known as sun spots or liver spots).  These are brown or dark flat spots on the skin caused by sun exposure.  This treatment is used as part of a broader skincare plan that includes sun avoidance.  It's important to note that this combination is not a treatment for all skin discolorations.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For solar lentigines, the typical dosage is a topical solution containing 2% Mequinol and 0.01% Tretinoin.  Apply this solution twice daily, morning and evening, with at least eight hours between applications. Use the applicator tip to target only the sun spots, avoiding the surrounding skin.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Mequinol + Tretinoin in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Erythema (redness)
* Peeling skin
* Itching (pruritus)
* Burning sensation
* Skin hypopigmentation (loss of skin color)
* Stinging
* Tingling
* Phototoxicity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Mequinol influences the skin chemicals responsible for pigmentation, thereby reducing the darkening of the skin. Tretinoin, a form of Vitamin A, promotes skin cell renewal, contributing to the lightening of sunspots.  The combination works synergistically to achieve a more effective lightening effect than either component alone.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This combination is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Mequinol, Tretinoin, or any other components of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  Use of Mequinol + Tretinoin increases the risk of phototoxicity (sunburn) and local adverse reactions (like redness and irritation). It also carries a risk of hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).
* **Caution:** Use with caution in patients with a history of vitiligo (a condition causing loss of skin color) or a family history of vitiligo.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Mequinol + Tretinoin is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it can cause fetal harm. It should be avoided during pregnancy.  The excretion of this medication in breast milk is unknown; use during breastfeeding only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.
* **Sun Sensitivity:** The medication can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight.  Always use sunscreen with a high SPF and avoid prolonged sun exposure, tanning beds, and sunlamps while using this medication.
