# Measles Vaccine Live + Mumps Virus Vaccine + Rubella vaccine Live
### Generic Name
Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine, Live

### Usage

The MMR vaccine is primarily used to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella, three highly contagious viral diseases.  Measles can cause fever, cough, rash, and potentially serious complications like pneumonia and encephalitis. Mumps can lead to swelling of the salivary glands, and in rare cases, meningitis or encephalitis. Rubella, particularly dangerous for pregnant women, can cause birth defects if contracted during pregnancy.  The vaccine is a cornerstone of childhood immunization schedules, offering robust protection against these potentially debilitating illnesses.  While its primary use is preventative, it can also be used in outbreak situations to control the spread of these diseases in susceptible populations.


### Dosage

The MMR vaccine is typically administered in two doses.  

* **First Dose:**  Generally given between 12 and 15 months of age.
* **Second Dose:**  Usually given between 4 and 6 years of age, before starting school.

The vaccine is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  There are no significant dosage variations based on weight, though the formulation itself is adjusted for appropriate age groups.  There is no oral form of this vaccine.  The exact schedule and timing may vary slightly depending on individual circumstances and public health recommendations; consult your healthcare provider for specific guidance.  

**Note:**  Specific dosage and scheduling recommendations can change based on evolving public health guidance, therefore always check with a doctor or local health authority for the most up-to-date information.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are usually mild and temporary and may include:

* Mild fever
* Rash
* Swelling or soreness at the injection site
* Joint pain (more common in adolescent girls and women)
* Headache
* Fatigue

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur, and immediate medical attention should be sought if these develop. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) – characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue
* Seizures
* Thrombocytopenic purpura (low platelet count)
* Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)


Always contact a healthcare professional if you experience any concerning side effects after receiving the MMR vaccine.


### How it Works

The MMR vaccine contains live, weakened (attenuated) viruses of measles, mumps, and rubella.  After receiving the vaccine, your body's immune system responds by producing antibodies against these viruses. These antibodies provide long-lasting immunity, protecting you from contracting these diseases if exposed in the future.  The attenuated viruses are not strong enough to cause illness, but they trigger the immune response necessary for protection.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:** The vaccine should not be given to individuals with a known allergy to any component of the vaccine, including neomycin or gelatin.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  The MMR vaccine should generally be avoided in individuals with severely compromised immune systems due to the risk of the attenuated viruses causing illness.  Consult with a healthcare provider to assess individual risk.
* **Pregnancy:**  Pregnant women should not receive the MMR vaccine.  They should be vaccinated after delivery if not already immune.
* **Interactions:**  There are no significant drug interactions, however, it's always recommended to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking before receiving any vaccine.

**Important Note:**  While rare, some individuals may experience a mild, temporary illness similar to the actual diseases after receiving the MMR vaccine.  This is a normal immune response and is not a cause for concern.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is the MMR vaccine safe?**  A: Yes, the MMR vaccine is safe and effective.  Millions of people have received it, and its benefits far outweigh the risks.
