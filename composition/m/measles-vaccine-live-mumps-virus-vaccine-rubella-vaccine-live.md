# Measles Vaccine Live + Mumps Virus Vaccine + Rubella vaccine Live

**Generic Name:** Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine, Live Virus

**Usage:**

* **Prevention:** The MMR vaccine is used to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella, three highly contagious viral diseases.  It's recommended for children and adults who haven't been vaccinated or who haven't had the diseases.  Specific schedules vary by country and region, but generally involve two doses.
* **Outbreaks:**  The vaccine may be recommended for individuals in areas experiencing outbreaks, even if they've received prior doses.
* **Immunocompromised (with caveats):** Vaccination may be considered for some immunocompromised individuals, but this requires careful evaluation by a healthcare professional due to increased risk of complications.


**Side Effects:**

Most side effects are mild and temporary.  They usually appear within 5-12 days of vaccination and resolve within a few days. These may include:

* **Common:**  Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site; mild fever; rash; irritability; drowsiness.
* **Less Common:**  Joint pain (more common in adult women), temporary low platelet count (thrombocytopenia),  swollen glands.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), seizures, encephalitis (brain inflammation), thrombocytopenic purpura (a bleeding disorder). These are extremely rare.


**How it Works:**

The MMR vaccine contains live, weakened (attenuated) viruses of measles, mumps, and rubella.  After vaccination, these weakened viruses replicate in the body to a limited extent, triggering an immune response. The body produces antibodies against these viruses, providing protection against future infection.  This immunity is typically long-lasting but booster doses may be recommended in certain situations.


**FAQs:**

* **Is the MMR vaccine safe?**  Yes, the MMR vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines available.  The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks of side effects.
* **Can I get measles, mumps, or rubella from the MMR vaccine?**  It's possible to experience mild symptoms resembling the actual diseases due to the live attenuated viruses in the vaccine, but these are generally much milder and less severe than the actual infections.  The vaccine cannot cause the serious complications associated with these diseases.
* **Can I get the MMR vaccine if I'm pregnant?** No, the MMR vaccine should not be given during pregnancy.  It's recommended to wait at least one month after receiving the MMR vaccine before trying to conceive.
* **What if I'm allergic to eggs or neomycin?**  Inform your healthcare provider about any allergies before receiving the vaccine.  Some vaccines may contain traces of eggs or neomycin, and alternative options may be available.
* **Can I get other vaccines at the same time as the MMR vaccine?**  Yes, often other vaccines can be given concurrently, however, your doctor should be consulted to ensure this is appropriate.
* **How effective is the MMR vaccine?** The MMR vaccine is highly effective, typically offering over 97% protection against measles, mumps, and rubella after two doses.
