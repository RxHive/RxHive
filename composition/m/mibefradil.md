# Mibefradil
### Generic Name
Mibefradil

### Usage
Mibefradil was a calcium channel blocker primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and chronic stable angina (chest pain).  It worked by relaxing blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, thus reducing the workload on the heart.  However, it's crucial to note that **Mibefradil is no longer available on the market** due to significant drug interactions.

### Dosage
Because Mibefradil is no longer available, specific dosage information is irrelevant for current medical practice.  The original dosage recommendations varied depending on the patient's condition and response to treatment and were determined by a physician.  It was available in tablet form.

### Side Effects
While Mibefradil is no longer available, it's important to understand its known side effects to appreciate why it was withdrawn:

* **Common side effects:**  Headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and edema (swelling).
* **Serious but less common side effects:**  Prolonged QT interval (a heart rhythm abnormality), liver problems, and potentially fatal drug interactions.  The risk of serious drug interactions was the primary reason for its withdrawal.

**It is crucial to remember that this information is for historical context only.  Do not attempt to obtain or use Mibefradil.**  If you experience any adverse effects from medication, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Mibefradil is a calcium channel blocker that works by affecting the flow of calcium ions into the cells of the heart and blood vessels.  By blocking calcium channels, it relaxes blood vessels, reducing peripheral vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure.  It also slightly slows the heart rate, further reducing the heart's workload.  It showed greater selectivity for T-type calcium channels, which are more involved in the regulation of heart rhythm than L-type calcium channels involved in heart muscle contraction.

### Precautions
Given that Mibefradil is no longer available, these precautions are purely for historical reference and should not be considered for current medical practice:

* **Contraindications:**  Mibefradil was contraindicated in patients with certain heart conditions, liver problems, or hypersensitivity to the drug.
* **Drug interactions:**  This was the major reason for its withdrawal.  Mibefradil interacted significantly with many other drugs, including several commonly prescribed medications, leading to potentially life-threatening consequences.
* **Specific warnings:** Caution was advised in patients with impaired kidney or liver function, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.

### FAQs
