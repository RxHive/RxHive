# Mesoglycan
### Generic Name
Mesoglycan

### Usage
Mesoglycan is a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from porcine intestinal mucosa or bovine aorta.  It's primarily used in Europe to treat various blood vessel disorders impacting homeostasis. Its therapeutic applications span a range of conditions characterized by vascular etiologies or manifestations. These include:

* **Diabetic retinopathy:**  A complication of diabetes affecting the eyes' blood vessels.
* **Ischemic stroke:** A stroke caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.
* **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):** Blood clots forming in the deep veins, usually in the legs.
* **Venous ulcers:**  Sores that develop on the legs and ankles due to poor blood circulation.
* **Telangiectasias:**  Small, dilated blood vessels visible on the skin's surface.
* **Raynaud phenomenon:**  A condition causing reduced blood flow to the fingers and toes in response to cold or stress.
* **Cerebrospinal-venous insufficiency:** Impaired drainage of cerebrospinal fluid.
* **Peripheral arterial disease (PAD):**  Narrowed arteries reducing blood flow to the limbs.
* **Mechanical edema:** Swelling caused by trauma.
* **Metabolic syndrome:** A cluster of conditions increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.  Long-term Mesoglycan use has shown promise in improving insulin sensitivity in patients with this syndrome.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and route of administration.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Oral:** The usual dose is 100 mg/day, either once daily or divided into two 50 mg doses. This is often used as add-on therapy. Treatment duration ranges from 2 weeks to 3 years.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** For conditions like chronic venous ulcers, ischemic stroke, and metabolic syndrome, the initial dose might be 30-60 mg/day for up to 3 weeks, or a single 60 mg dose, potentially with continued oral therapy (100 mg/day) for up to 18 months.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Mesoglycan in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Cutaneous reactions (skin reactions)
* Injection-site reactions (if administered intramuscularly)
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain)
* Heartburn
* Diarrhea

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Mesoglycan acts as both an antithrombotic (prevents blood clot formation) and a profibrinolytic (enhances the breakdown of blood clots). Its components, heparin and dermatan sulfate, inhibit thrombin, a key enzyme in blood clotting, through different pathways.  Further, it:

* Inhibits neutrophil adhesion and activation (reducing inflammation).
* Decreases capillary permeability (reducing fluid leakage from blood vessels).
* Enhances systemic fibrinolysis (improving the body's ability to break down clots).
* Reduces the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, a factor in atherosclerosis and tumor growth. This effect may involve modulation of cell cycle regulators like p53 and p21, and potentially the mTOR signaling pathway.
* Inhibits the production of endothelial microparticles (EMPs), which contribute to thrombogenesis (blood clot formation).

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Mesoglycan is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Mesoglycan, heparin, or heparinoid derivatives; concurrent use of heparin or oral anticoagulants; and hemorrhagic disease (bleeding disorders).
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of injection-site reactions and gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, etc.).
* **Caution:** Use caution when combining Mesoglycan with other antithrombotic drugs.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to insufficient safety and efficacy data.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Mesoglycan?**  A: Store according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Can I take Mesoglycan with other medications?** A:  Discuss all medications you're taking with your doctor before starting Mesoglycan, especially anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses. Do not double the dose to compensate.
* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects of Mesoglycan?** A: Long-term studies are ongoing, but currently available data suggests potential benefits in improving insulin sensitivity in patients with metabolic syndrome, although further research is needed.  Always discuss any concerns about long-term effects with your healthcare provider.
* **Q: Is Mesoglycan suitable for everyone?** A:  No, Mesoglycan is not suitable for everyone.  Your doctor will assess your individual health condition to determine if it's appropriate for you.
