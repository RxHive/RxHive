# Minocycline (Topical)
### Generic Name
Minocycline (Topical)

### Usage
Minocycline topical is a tetracycline antibiotic used to treat inflammatory lesions associated with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in individuals aged 9 years and older.  It's also indicated for treating inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults.  Importantly, this topical formulation is not for treating infections.

### Dosage

**Acne Vulgaris (Moderate-to-Severe):**

* **Adults and Children ≥9 years:** For the 4% foam formulation, apply a small amount (about the size of a cherry) to the fingertips and gently rub it onto the affected acne areas once daily.  Reapply as needed until all affected areas are covered.

**Rosacea:**

* **Adults:** For the 1.5% foam formulation, apply a small amount (about the size of a cherry) to the fingertips and apply a thin layer to the entire face once daily. Reapply as needed to ensure complete facial coverage.

**Pediatric Considerations:**  Safety and effectiveness haven't been established for children under 9 years old. Tetracycline use should generally be avoided during tooth development (infancy and children ≤8 years) unless other treatments are ineffective or contraindicated.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in >10% of patients):**

* Erythema (redness) of the skin
* Hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin)

**Less Common Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin peeling (desquamation)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  While less frequent,  serious side effects like autoimmune reactions (lupus-like syndrome, hepatitis, vasculitis), central nervous system effects (dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo), liver damage (hepatotoxicity), severe skin reactions, increased intracranial pressure, metabolic disturbances, photosensitivity, and infections (including *Clostridioides difficile* infection) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms.


### How it Works

The exact mechanism by which topical minocycline treats acne or rosacea isn't fully understood.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Minocycline topical is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or any components of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with systemic aminolevulinic acid.  Topical minocycline may increase the levels or effects of several other medications, including systemic and topical aminolevulinic acid, porfimer, and verteporfin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Tetracyclines should be avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration and bone growth inhibition in the developing fetus.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication, as excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Specific Populations:** Use caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, although dosage adjustments may not be necessary due to the low systemic absorption of topical minocycline.  Close monitoring is advised.
* **Warnings:** Be aware of the increased risk of various adverse events, including autoimmune issues, CNS effects, hepatotoxicity, skin reactions, and increased intracranial pressure.  Superinfections and photosensitivity are also possibilities.  Avoid excessive sun exposure and use sun protection.
