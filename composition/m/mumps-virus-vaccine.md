# Mumps Virus Vaccine
### Generic Name
Mumps Virus Vaccine

### Usage
The mumps virus vaccine is used to prevent mumps, a contagious viral infection that primarily affects the salivary glands.  This vaccine is highly effective and is a crucial part of routine childhood immunization programs worldwide. It's often administered in combination with measles and rubella vaccines (MMR).  While primarily used for preventing mumps infection in children, it can also be given to susceptible adults who lack immunity.

### Dosage

**Pediatric Dosage (≥12 months):**

* Two 0.5 mL doses are recommended.
* The first dose should be given between 12 and 15 months of age.
* The second dose should be administered before school entry (typically between 3 and 5 years of age).  
* Doses should be separated by at least four weeks.
* If routine vaccination was missed, it can be given at any age.  Children vaccinated before 12 months should receive the full two-dose schedule.
* Administration is typically intramuscular (IM), but for children with bleeding disorders, subcutaneous (SubQ) injection is preferred.  The MMR vaccine is always given in combination.

**Adult Dosage:**

* A single 0.5 mL dose is given subcutaneously (SubQ), preferably in the outer aspect of the upper arm.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are recommended for individuals with hepatic or renal impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Fever (≤100°F)
* Rash
* Parotitis (inflammation of the salivary glands)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**

* Convulsions
* Confusion
* Severe or persistent headache
* High fever (>103°F)
* Orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) in post-pubescent males and adults
* Thrombocytopenic purpura (a bleeding disorder)
* Anaphylactic reactions


**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

The mumps virus vaccine contains a weakened (attenuated) form of the mumps virus.  Upon administration, this weakened virus triggers an immune response in the body. This response produces antibodies that protect against future mumps infections.  These antibodies remain in the body, providing long-term immunity.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to mumps virus vaccine (live)
* Hypersensitivity to neomycin (an antibiotic sometimes used in vaccine production)
* Hypersensitivity to eggs (because the vaccine is often grown in chicken eggs)

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in individuals with acute illness (defer vaccination in moderate to severe illness).
* Use with caution in patients with bone marrow/lymphatic system disorders, blood disorders, or compromised immune systems (including advanced AIDS).
* There is an increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions/hypersensitivity, syncope (fainting), transient visual disturbances, weakness, and tonic-clonic movements.
* The vaccine should not be given within one month of other live vaccines. Live vaccines should be given at least three weeks before or three months after immunoglobulin administration. Immunosuppressants may also impact the vaccine's effectiveness and should be avoided for at least three months before or after the vaccine is given.
* Pregnant women should not receive this vaccine.  Lactation status is not addressed in current recommendations.  Women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for three months following vaccination.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take this vaccine with other medications?**  A:  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, particularly immunosuppressants and other live vaccines, as interactions are possible.

**Q: How is the mumps vaccine stored?**  A: Store the vaccine according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.

**Q: How long does the immunity last after vaccination?**  A:  The immunity provided by the mumps vaccine is long-lasting but can wane over time.  Booster doses may be recommended depending on individual risk factors and public health recommendations.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning side effects following vaccination.

**Q: Is the Mumps vaccine safe?** A: The mumps vaccine has a strong safety profile and is generally well-tolerated. However, like all medications, it carries some potential risks, as outlined above. The benefits of preventing mumps far outweigh these risks.
