# Megestrol
### Generic Name
Megestrol

### Usage
Megestrol is a synthetic hormone that mimics the effects of progesterone.  Its primary use is to stimulate appetite and promote weight gain in individuals experiencing significant weight loss due to conditions like cancer, AIDS, or other chronic illnesses. This is its most common application.  It's also sometimes used to treat endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining) and to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining).  However, its use in cancer treatment is less common now due to the availability of more effective therapies.  The stimulation of appetite is often the more prominent reason for its prescription.

### Dosage
Dosage for megestrol varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's individual needs.  A physician will determine the appropriate dose.  There is no standardized pediatric dosage as its use in children is uncommon.


* **Appetite stimulation:**  The usual starting dose for adults is 800 mg daily, taken orally.  This may be adjusted based on the patient's response. Lower doses may be effective for some individuals.

* **Endometrial cancer:**  Dosage and administration route (oral or intravenous) will be determined by a physician based on the stage of the cancer and the patient's overall health. This is typically used in combination with other cancer therapies.


**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge only.  **Never** adjust your megestrol dosage without consulting your doctor.  Incorrect dosage can lead to serious side effects.  The medication comes in oral forms (tablets and suspension). Intravenous administration is usually only undertaken in a hospital setting.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of megestrol include:

* Increased appetite and weight gain (although this is the intended effect, excessive weight gain can be problematic)
* Fluid retention (edema)
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Blood clots (a serious side effect)


Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Increased risk of infection
* Mood changes (depression, anxiety)
* Breast tenderness
* Irregular menstrual bleeding

If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Megestrol works by binding to progesterone receptors in various parts of the body.  While its exact mechanism for appetite stimulation isn't fully understood, it's believed to affect the brain's appetite control centers, leading to increased hunger and food intake.  In the treatment of endometrial cancer, it works by interfering with the growth and spread of cancer cells.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Megestrol should not be used in individuals with a known allergy to megestrol or other progestins. It should be used with extreme caution (or not at all) in patients with a history of blood clots, stroke, or heart disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Megestrol can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the liver's metabolism.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Megestrol is contraindicated during pregnancy because it can cause harm to the developing fetus. Its use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects of megestrol, such as blood clots and fluid retention. Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Children:** Megestrol is generally not recommended for children unless under specific circumstances and with close medical supervision due to potential long-term effects.

* **Q: How should I store megestrol?** A: Store megestrol at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
