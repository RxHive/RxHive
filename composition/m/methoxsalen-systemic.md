# Methoxsalen (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Methoxsalen (Systemic)

### Usage

Methoxsalen is a medication used to manage several skin conditions. Its primary uses are:

* **Severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis:**  Methoxsalen is employed when other treatments for psoriasis have proven ineffective.  It helps control the symptoms of this chronic skin condition. This use typically involves combining methoxsalen with ultraviolet A (UVA) light therapy (PUVA therapy).

* **Repigmentation of idiopathic vitiligo:** Vitiligo is a condition characterized by the loss of skin pigment.  Methoxsalen, again often used in conjunction with UVA light, can help restore some pigment to affected areas.

* **Palliative treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) skin manifestations:** For patients with CTCL whose symptoms aren't responding to other treatments, methoxsalen may be used extracorporeally (outside the body) as part of a photopheresis procedure to alleviate skin symptoms.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the form of methoxsalen used (hard gelatin capsules or soft gelatin capsules which have different bioavailability), and the patient's weight.  **Crucially, the information below is for guidance only and should not replace the instructions from a prescribing healthcare professional.**  They will tailor the dosage to your specific needs and monitor your progress.


**Vitiligo (Oral):**

* **Hard Gelatin Capsules:** Typically 20 mg, 2-4 hours before exposure to UVA light.  The dose may be adjusted based on the skin's reaction.  Treatment is not given on consecutive days.

**Psoriasis (Oral):**

* The dose is weight-based and administered 1.5-2 hours (soft gelatin capsules) or 2 hours (hard gelatin capsules) before UVA light exposure.  Doses are typically not administered on consecutive days.  The prescribing physician will determine the appropriate dosage regimen.

* **Example Weight-Based Dosage (Oral):**
    * <30 kg: 10 mg
    * 30-50 kg: 20 mg
    * 51-65 kg: 30 mg
    * 66-80 kg: 40 mg
    * 81-90 kg: 50 mg
    * 91-115 kg: 60 mg
    * >115 kg: 70 mg

**Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (Extracorporeal Photopheresis):**

* The dose is determined by the treatment volume using a specific calculation (Treatment volume x 0.017 = mL of Methoxsalen needed). A healthcare professional will manage this aspect of the treatment.  The treatment schedule involves specific cycles and frequency determined by a physician.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of methoxsalen in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment; however, caution should be exercised in patients with liver problems.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Pruritus (itching)
* Nausea

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Edema (swelling)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure) - particularly associated with photopheresis
* Depression
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Nervousness
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Skin reactions (bullae, burning, erythema, rash, etc.)
* Cataracts (eye damage)
* Infections (associated with photopheresis vascular access)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Methoxsalen is a photosensitizing drug.  It works by binding to DNA in skin cells. When the skin is then exposed to UVA light, the methoxsalen-DNA complex triggers a reaction that affects cell growth and division. In psoriasis, this helps slow down the rapid skin cell turnover.  In vitiligo, it stimulates repigmentation. In CTCL, the exact mechanism in photopheresis is more complex but involves modifying the immune response.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methoxsalen is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to methoxsalen or psoralens, certain photosensitivity diseases (albinism, lupus erythematosus, porphyrias, xeroderma pigmentosum), invasive squamous cell cancer (capsule only), aphakia (absence of the eye lens), melanoma or history of melanoma (capsule only), and contraindications to the photopheresis procedure.

* **Drug Interactions:** Methoxsalen can interact with various medications, particularly those metabolized by the CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 enzymes. Consult your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Methoxsalen is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Women of childbearing age should avoid pregnancy while using this medication. It's also excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Sun Sensitivity:** Methoxsalen increases the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and UVA light.  Strict avoidance of sun exposure (including sunlamps) for 24 hours after taking methoxsalen is essential to prevent severe sunburn.  Protective clothing, eyewear, and sunscreen should be used.

* **Ocular Risks:**  There is a risk of cataract formation.  Eye protection is crucial during and after treatment.

* **Skin Cancer Risk:** Long-term use increases the risk of skin cancer, including melanoma.  Regular skin exams are recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use methoxsalen without UVA light therapy?** A: No, methoxsalen's effectiveness in treating psoriasis and vitiligo relies on its interaction with UVA light.

* **Q: How should I store methoxsalen?** A: Store according to the instructions on the packaging, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance; do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Are there any foods I should avoid while taking methoxsalen?** A: Yes, foods containing furocoumarins (e.g., limes, figs, parsley, celery, etc.) should be avoided as they can increase photosensitivity.

* **Q: How long will I need to take methoxsalen?** A: The treatment duration depends on the condition and your response to therapy. Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate treatment length.
