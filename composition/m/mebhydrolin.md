# Mebhydrolin
### Generic Name
Mebhydrolin

### Usage
Mebhydrolin is a first-generation H1-antihistamine primarily used for symptomatic relief of allergic conditions.  Its main applications include managing the symptoms of nasal allergies (allergic rhinitis) and allergic skin conditions (allergic dermatosis), such as hives (urticaria).  While not its primary use, it exhibits some antimuscarinic and sedative properties.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For allergic conditions, the usual oral dose is 100-300 mg per day.  This total daily dose is typically divided into several smaller doses throughout the day.

**Children:** Dosage for children varies significantly with age:

* **Under 2 years:** 50-100 mg per day, divided into smaller doses.
* **2-5 years:** 50-150 mg per day, divided into smaller doses.
* **5-10 years:** 100-200 mg per day, divided into smaller doses.
* **Over 10 years:** 100-300 mg per day, divided into smaller doses.

**Important Note:**  These are general guidelines.  A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage based on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of their allergic symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's specific instructions.  Mebhydrolin is usually available in oral tablet form, and the tablet may be crushed and mixed with food for children if needed.

### How it Works

Mebhydrolin is an ethylenediamine derivative antihistamine.  It works by blocking the action of histamine at the H1 receptor. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions, causing inflammation and symptoms like itching, sneezing, and swelling. By blocking histamine, mebhydrolin helps to reduce these allergic symptoms.  It also possesses antimuscarinic and sedative properties, which contribute to some of its effects.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Mebhydrolin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components; premature or full-term neonates; during the first trimester of pregnancy; those experiencing an acute asthma attack; those with prostatic hypertrophy (enlarged prostate); and those with narrow-angle glaucoma.

**Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, closed-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hyperplasia, pyloroduodenal obstruction, epilepsy, the elderly, pregnant women (after the first trimester), and individuals who operate machinery or drive vehicles, as it can cause drowsiness.

**Drug Interactions:**  Mebhydrolin can enhance the sedative effects of other CNS depressants.  Additive antimuscarinic effects may occur with MAO inhibitors, atropine, and tricyclic antidepressants.  It may mask the warning symptoms of ototoxic agents (like aminoglycoside antibiotics).  Avoid concomitant use with these medications.
