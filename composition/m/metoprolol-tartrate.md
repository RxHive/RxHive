# Metoprolol Tartrate
### Generic Name
Metoprolol Tartrate

### Usage
Metoprolol tartrate is a beta-blocker primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina (chest pain).  It works by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of contractions, thereby lowering blood pressure and reducing the heart's workload. This makes it effective in managing both the symptoms and progression of these conditions.  Beyond hypertension and angina, metoprolol tartrate also finds use in:

* **Heart failure:** It can help improve symptoms and survival in certain types of heart failure.
* **Migraine prophylaxis:** It can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches.
* **Post-myocardial infarction (heart attack):** It's used to reduce the risk of further heart attacks and death following a heart attack.
* **Hyperthyroidism-associated tachycardia:**  It can help control a rapid heart rate associated with an overactive thyroid.
* **Tremors (essential tremor):** In some cases, it may help reduce the severity of tremors.


It's crucial to understand that metoprolol tartrate is prescribed to address specific underlying conditions and should only be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage of metoprolol tartrate varies significantly depending on the individual's condition, age, weight, and response to the medication.  It is *always* critical to follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.  There is no universally applicable dosage, and self-adjustment can be dangerous.

**Oral (Tablets):**  Dosage typically starts low and is gradually increased as needed.  Adults might begin with 25-50 mg once or twice daily, while pediatric dosing is strictly determined by a physician based on weight and condition.

**Intravenous (IV):** IV administration is typically only used in hospital settings for specific conditions such as hypertension crises or following a heart attack. The dosage and administration are closely monitored by medical professionals.  It is not appropriate for self-administration.


**Important Note:**  Different forms (extended-release, immediate-release) have different dosing schedules. The medication packaging and your physician's instructions will provide the correct information for your specific prescription.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of metoprolol tartrate include:

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Lightheadedness
* Nausea
* Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
* Cold hands and feet
* Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
* Constipation
* Diarrhea

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Worsening of heart failure
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Depression
* Hallucinations
* Worsening of asthma or other respiratory conditions


If you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Metoprolol tartrate is a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist. In simpler terms, it blocks the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on the heart. These hormones normally increase heart rate and the force of contractions. By blocking these effects, metoprolol tartrate reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and the heart's workload.  This helps to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of complications associated with hypertension, angina, and other conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Metoprolol tartrate should not be used in individuals with certain heart conditions (e.g., severe bradycardia, second- or third-degree heart block, cardiogenic shock), or those with severe reactive airway disease (e.g., severe asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

* **Drug Interactions:** Metoprolol tartrate can interact with many other medications, including calcium channel blockers, other beta-blockers, and certain antidepressants.  It's essential to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of metoprolol tartrate during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of metoprolol tartrate, requiring lower doses and careful monitoring.

* **Sudden discontinuation:** Abruptly stopping metoprolol tartrate can be dangerous, potentially leading to serious cardiovascular events.  The medication should always be discontinued gradually under the guidance of a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking metoprolol tartrate?**  A:  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of metoprolol tartrate, especially dizziness and low blood pressure.  Limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication.

* **Q: How should I store metoprolol tartrate?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking metoprolol tartrate if I feel better?** A: No. Never stop taking metoprolol tartrate without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can be harmful.

* **Q: Does metoprolol tartrate cause weight gain?** A:  Weight gain is not a common side effect, but it's important to follow a healthy diet and lifestyle while taking this medication.  Any significant changes in weight should be discussed with your doctor.
