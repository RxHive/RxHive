# Metoprolol Tartrate

**Generic Name:** Metoprolol Tartrate

**Usage:**

Metoprolol tartrate is a beta-blocker primarily used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):** It helps lower blood pressure by slowing the heart rate and relaxing blood vessels.
* **Angina (chest pain):** It reduces the heart's workload, decreasing oxygen demand and thus relieving chest pain.
* **Heart failure (in certain cases):**  It can improve symptoms and survival in some patients with heart failure, usually in combination with other medications.
* **Migraine headaches (prophylaxis):** It can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches.
* **Following a heart attack (myocardial infarction):** It helps reduce the risk of further cardiac events.
* **Hyperthyroidism (in some cases):** It can help manage some symptoms of overactive thyroid.
* **Tremors (essential tremor):**  Can be used to reduce the severity of tremors.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Slow heart rate (bradycardia):** This is a significant concern and necessitates careful monitoring, particularly in those with pre-existing heart conditions.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Dizziness:** Lightheadedness or vertigo.
* **Shortness of breath:** Difficulty breathing.
* **Cold hands and feet:** Impaired circulation.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stool.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Depression:**  Mood changes and sadness.
* **Sleep disturbances:** Insomnia or difficulty sleeping.
* **Sexual dysfunction:** Changes in libido or erectile dysfunction.

Serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Heart block:** A serious disruption of the heart's rhythm.
* **Heart failure worsening:**  In some individuals, it can exacerbate existing heart failure.
* **Bronchospasm:**  Narrowing of the airways, particularly problematic for those with asthma or COPD.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Rare but can be life-threatening.


**How it Works:**

Metoprolol tartrate works by blocking the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and blood vessels.  These receptors typically increase heart rate, blood pressure, and the force of heart contractions. By blocking these receptors, metoprolol lowers heart rate, reduces blood pressure, and decreases the heart's workload.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I stop taking metoprolol suddenly?** No, you should never stop taking metoprolol suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to serious complications, including rebound hypertension or angina.  Your doctor will gradually reduce your dosage to minimize withdrawal effects.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking metoprolol?**  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but excessive alcohol use can interact with metoprolol and worsen its side effects, particularly low blood pressure.  Consult your doctor about alcohol consumption.

* **Can I take metoprolol with other medications?** Metoprolol can interact with many other medications, including some over-the-counter drugs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor and pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?** Signs of an allergic reaction can include rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, or dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
