# Methylergometrine

**Generic Name:** Methylergometrine

**Usage:** Methylergometrine is primarily used to control postpartum hemorrhage (PPH),  which is excessive bleeding after childbirth.  It's also sometimes used to treat other types of uterine bleeding, though this is less common.  It is administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally.  It is usually given after the delivery of the placenta.

**Side Effects:**  Methylergometrine, like other ergot alkaloids, can cause a range of side effects, including:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common side effects.
* **High blood pressure (hypertension):** This is a significant concern, especially in individuals with pre-existing hypertension.  Careful monitoring of blood pressure is essential.
* **Headache:**  Can range from mild to severe.
* **Dizziness:**  May be accompanied by lightheadedness.
* **Chest pain:** This is a serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Tingling or numbness in the extremities:**  This is due to vasoconstriction.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Though rare, allergic reactions including rash, itching, and swelling can occur.
* **Weakness and fatigue:** General feelings of malaise.
* **Seizures:** In rare cases, particularly with high doses.


**How it Works:** Methylergometrine is an ergot alkaloid that acts directly on the uterine muscle, causing it to contract strongly. This contraction reduces bleeding by constricting blood vessels in the uterus and minimizing the size of the uterine cavity.  The mechanism involves stimulation of Î±-adrenergic and serotonergic receptors in uterine smooth muscle.

**FAQs:**

* **Is methylergometrine safe during pregnancy?**  It's generally considered safe to use *after* childbirth to control postpartum hemorrhage, but its use *during* pregnancy is generally avoided due to potential risks of affecting uterine blood flow and potentially causing complications for the fetus.
* **Can I take methylergometrine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications
