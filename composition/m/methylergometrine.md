# Methylergometrine
### Generic Name
Methylergometrine

### Usage
Methylergometrine is primarily used to control postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), a significant bleeding complication after childbirth.  This bleeding often stems from uterine atony (the uterus failing to contract properly) or subinvolution (the uterus not returning to its normal size after delivery).  It's also used to manage uterine hemorrhage during the second stage of labor, specifically after delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby.  The drug's action is to stimulate the uterus to contract more forcefully, reducing blood loss.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the route of administration and the specific clinical situation.  Always follow the prescribing healthcare professional's instructions.

* **Postpartum Hemorrhage (associated with uterine atony or subinvolution):**
    * **Intramuscular (IM):** 0.2 mg (1 mL) following delivery of the placenta or during the puerperium; this dose may be repeated every 2 to 4 hours as needed.
    * **Intravenous (IV):** 0.2 mg (1 mL) administered slowly over at least 60 seconds.  Routine IV administration is not recommended; it's reserved for life-threatening situations only.
    * **Oral:** 0.2 mg three or four times daily (tid or qid) for up to one week.

* **Uterine Hemorrhage (during second stage of labor):**
    * **IM:** 0.2 mg (1 mL) following delivery of the anterior shoulder; this dose may be repeated every 2 to 4 hours as needed.
    * **IV:** 0.2 mg (1 mL) administered slowly over at least 60 seconds.  Use only if essential for life-saving measures.
    * **Oral:** 0.2 mg three or four times daily (tid or qid) during the puerperium for up to one week.

**Pediatric Use:**  Methylergometrine is not typically used in children.  Accidental neonatal administration has been reported to cause serious adverse effects, including respiratory depression and convulsions.


### Side Effects
* **Common:**
    * Hypertension (high blood pressure)
    * Headache

* **Serious (but less common):**
    * Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
    * Seizures

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially severe ones, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Methylergometrine is a semi-synthetic ergot alkaloid. It directly affects the smooth muscle of the uterus, increasing the strength, frequency, and duration of uterine contractions. This strong and sustained contraction helps to reduce blood loss by constricting blood vessels in the uterus and minimizing bleeding from the placental site.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Methylergometrine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, hypertension (high blood pressure), and toxemia (a dangerous pregnancy complication involving high blood pressure).

* **Use with Caution:**  Exercise caution with concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, coronary artery disease or risk factors for it (smoking, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol),  obliterative vascular disease, and sepsis. The increased risk of myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart) and infarction (heart attack) should be considered, especially with methylergometrine-induced vasospasm.  Intra-arterial or periarterial injection must be strictly avoided.  The drug should be used cautiously in patients with a history of vascular disease, or other conditions that could increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Methylergometrine is classified as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully known. It's also excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Other Interactions:** Concurrent use with lopinavir may increase the risk of methylergometrine toxicity.

* **General Considerations:** Store separately from other medications for neonatal administration. Close monitoring of blood pressure, particularly with IV administration, is vital because of the potential for sudden hypertensive or cerebrovascular accidents.  The drug is not recommended for routine use and should be limited to life-threatening situations.



### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store methylergometrine?**  A: Store it as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist; typically, it should be kept away from light and moisture, and at room temperature.

* **Q: Can I take methylergometrine with other medications?** A: Always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance; do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Is methylergometrine safe during pregnancy?** A:  It's classified as Pregnancy Category C.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against the potential benefits and risks by a healthcare professional.

* **Q: Can I breastfeed while taking methylergometrine?** A: While it is excreted in breast milk, the decision to continue breastfeeding while using this medication should be made in consultation with your doctor, considering both the benefits of breastfeeding and the potential risks to the infant.
