# Magnesium Chloride
### Generic Name
Magnesium Chloride

### Usage
Magnesium chloride is primarily used as a dietary supplement to ensure adequate magnesium intake.  It's also used medically to treat and prevent hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels in the blood). Hypomagnesemia can result from various conditions, including malnutrition, malabsorption syndromes, chronic diarrhea, and certain medications.  While less common, magnesium chloride may also be used as an adjunct in the treatment of some cardiovascular conditions, although this use is often secondary and requires careful medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  The amount of elemental magnesium in a given dose of magnesium chloride varies depending on the salt form.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate elemental magnesium content.  1 gram of magnesium chloride contains approximately 120 mg of elemental magnesium.

**Adults:**

* **Dietary Supplement:** The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for magnesium varies by age and sex.  A healthcare provider can determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs. Typical oral supplementation may involve one or two tablets daily, but this should always be confirmed with a doctor or pharmacist.
* **Hypomagnesemia Treatment (IV):**  Intravenous administration for hypomagnesemia is typically guided by serum magnesium levels and the severity of the deficiency.  The dosage is usually determined and closely monitored by a healthcare professional.


**Children:**

Dosage for children depends heavily on age, weight, and the reason for magnesium supplementation.  Pediatric use often involves intravenous administration in cases of severe hypomagnesemia under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  Oral supplementation in children should only be done as directed by a physician.  The recommended daily allowance (RDA) varies widely by age group.

**Dosage Forms:** Magnesium chloride is available in oral tablet form and as an intravenous (IV) solution for injection. Oral forms should be swallowed whole with water and not crushed. IV administration is always performed under medical supervision in a controlled healthcare setting.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Diarrhea (especially with high oral doses)
* **Less Common but Serious:**  While rare, high doses of magnesium chloride, especially IV, can lead to serious side effects such as hypotension (low blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory depression, and muscle weakness.  These symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

* **Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.

### How it Works

Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in hundreds of bodily processes. It plays a crucial role in muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, blood pressure regulation, and protein synthesis. Magnesium chloride supplements replenish magnesium levels when they are low, correcting the deficiency and alleviating the associated symptoms.  In intravenous administration, it rapidly increases blood magnesium levels.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Magnesium chloride is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with severe renal impairment, untreated heart disease, and myasthenia gravis.  It should also be avoided in those with a known hypersensitivity to magnesium or any of the formulation components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Magnesium chloride can interact with several medications, including certain antibiotics (quinolones), bisphosphonates, some heart medications (calcium channel blockers), and others.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Magnesium chloride is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to a developing fetus are not fully understood.  It's crucial to discuss its use with a healthcare provider if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to magnesium-related side effects due to age-related changes in kidney function.  Careful monitoring and lower dosages are often necessary.
* **Children:**  As with adults, children receiving IV magnesium chloride must be under close medical supervision.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take magnesium chloride without a doctor's recommendation?**
    * A: While magnesium chloride is available over-the-counter as a supplement, it's best to consult a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications.

    * A: Store magnesium chloride tablets according to the instructions on the product label. Generally, this involves storing them in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
    * A: If you miss a dose of oral magnesium chloride, take it as soon as you remember unless it is near the time of your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: What are the signs of magnesium overdose?**
    * A:  Signs of magnesium overdose can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, bradycardia, muscle weakness, respiratory depression, and even cardiac arrest in severe cases.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose.

* **Q:  Is it safe to take magnesium chloride long-term?**
    * A: Long-term use should be discussed with a doctor.  Prolonged use may require monitoring of magnesium levels and kidney function.
