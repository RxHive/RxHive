# Migalastat
### Generic Name
Migalastat

### Usage

Migalastat is a medication used to treat adults with Fabry disease.  Fabry disease is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). This deficiency leads to a buildup of certain fatty substances (globotriaosylceramide or Gb3) in the body's cells, damaging various organs and tissues. Migalastat is specifically indicated for adults with Fabry disease who have a genetic variant that is considered "amenable" to treatment with this medication, as determined by an in vitro assay.  This means that their specific genetic mutation allows the drug to effectively interact with and improve the function of their deficient alpha-galactosidase A. It's crucial to note that not all Fabry disease patients will benefit from migalastat.  A genetic test is necessary to assess suitability for this treatment.


### Dosage

The typical dosage for adults with Fabry disease and an amenable GLA gene variant is 123 mg (equivalent to 150 mg of migalastat hydrochloride) taken orally once every other day.  It's essential *not* to take the medication on two consecutive days.  The medication should be taken on an empty stomach;  avoid consuming food for at least two hours before and two hours after taking the dose (for a total of four hours of fasting).  Clear liquids are permissible during this fasting period.  The capsule should be swallowed whole; it should not be crushed, chewed, or opened.

If a dose is missed, it should only be taken if it's within 12 hours of the scheduled time. If more than 12 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and resume the usual every-other-day schedule.

Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling. For patients with renal (kidney) impairment, the medication is not recommended if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or if the patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.  Patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or greater do not require dosage adjustments.

The safety and effectiveness of migalastat have not been established in children.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Urinary tract infection
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Fever

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) include:

* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Back pain
* Cough
* Nosebleed (epistaxis)

Serious side effects are less common but possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms while taking migalastat, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Migalastat is a pharmacological chaperone. This means it works by binding to the faulty alpha-galactosidase A enzyme produced by individuals with a certain type of Fabry disease mutation.  This binding stabilizes the enzyme, helping it to fold correctly and reach its destination within the cell (the lysosome). In the lysosome, the enzyme can break down the harmful Gb3 that builds up in Fabry disease. By improving the function of the deficient enzyme, migalastat helps to reduce the accumulation of Gb3 and, consequently, lessen the damage caused by the disease.


### Precautions

Migalastat is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to migalastat or any component of the medication.  

Renal function should be monitored, especially in patients with impaired kidney function.  The drug is not recommended for patients with severely impaired kidney function (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or ESRD.

Limited data exist regarding the use of migalastat during pregnancy and lactation.  Healthcare providers should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks when considering prescribing migalastat to pregnant or breastfeeding women.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see results from Migalastat?**
A: The time it takes to observe improvements varies among individuals. Consistent medication adherence is crucial for optimal treatment outcomes.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider is necessary to assess treatment efficacy.

**Q:  Can I take Migalastat with other medications?**
A:  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. Potential drug interactions may exist.

**Q: How should I store Migalastat?**
A: Store Migalastat at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Refer to the dosage section above for instructions on missed doses.

**Q:  Is Migalastat right for everyone with Fabry disease?**
A: No, Migalastat is only suitable for individuals with Fabry disease and a specific type of amenable GLA gene variant identified through a genetic test.  Your doctor will determine if you are a suitable candidate for this treatment.
