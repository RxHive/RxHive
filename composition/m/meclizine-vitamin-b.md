# Meclizine + Vitamin B
### Generic Name
Meclizine + Vitamin B Complex (Various formulations exist; the specific vitamin B components will vary)

**Note:**  There isn't a single, universally standardized "Meclizine + Vitamin B" formulation.  Many combination products exist, each with a unique blend of B vitamins. This information provides general guidance based on the common components. Always refer to your specific product's labeling for accurate details on ingredients and dosage.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat symptoms associated with motion sickness and vertigo.  Meclizine is an antihistamine with antiemetic properties (meaning it helps prevent vomiting). It works by blocking the action of histamine in the brain, thus reducing nausea and dizziness. The addition of Vitamin B complex is often included to address potential nutrient deficiencies that might accompany nausea, vomiting, or conditions causing dizziness.  Some manufacturers might include Vitamin B to support overall health and well-being, though the direct therapeutic impact on motion sickness or vertigo is primarily from the Meclizine.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific product formulation and the age and health of the patient.  There is no standard "Meclizine + Vitamin B" dosage since formulations vary.  **Always check the product label for precise instructions.**  Generally:

* **Adults (Oral):** Meclizine dosage for motion sickness typically ranges from 25-50 mg, taken once or twice daily.  The Vitamin B dosage will depend on the specific product.
* **Children (Oral):** Meclizine is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age unless explicitly directed by a physician.  Always follow a doctor's prescription and instructions carefully.  Formulations specifically for pediatric use may exist, but these are rare for this combination.
* **IV Administration:** Meclizine is not typically administered intravenously.  Vitamin B complex is sometimes given intravenously, but this would need to be done under strict medical supervision and is not usually combined with Meclizine this way.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), rapid heartbeat, seizures.

**If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.**


### How it Works

Meclizine blocks the action of histamine in the central nervous system, which helps reduce the signals that cause nausea and dizziness.  It also has some effects on the inner ear, helping to stabilize balance.  The added Vitamin B components offer nutritional support, but their direct contribution to treating motion sickness or vertigo is minimal.  The different B vitamins play various roles in metabolism, nerve function, and red blood cell formation.
