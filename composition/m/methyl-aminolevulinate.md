# Methyl Aminolevulinate
### Generic Name
Methyl Aminolevulinate

### Usage
Methyl aminolevulinate is a medication used in combination with red light therapy (photodynamic therapy or PDT) to treat certain skin conditions. Its primary use is for the treatment of actinic keratoses (AKs), which are precancerous lesions on the skin, specifically thin and moderately thick, non-hyperkeratotic, and non-pigmented AKs located on the face and scalp of immunocompetent adults.  Other therapies are considered less appropriate. It may also be used to treat superficial basal cell carcinomas (a type of skin cancer).  It is important to note that methyl aminolevulinate is always used with a specific red light source; it's not effective on its own.

### Dosage
Methyl aminolevulinate is applied topically as a 16.8% cream. Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated.

**Actinic Keratosis:**  Up to 1 gram of cream (approximately half a tube) is applied to the lesion and a 5mm border of surrounding skin, to a thickness of 1 mm.  An occlusive, non-absorbent dressing is applied for 3 hours. The treatment area shouldn't exceed 80 x 180 mmÂ².  After 3 hours (but within 4 hours of application), the dressing is removed, the cream is rinsed off, and red-light photodynamic therapy is performed. This process is repeated once after 7 days, and the response is assessed 3 months after the last treatment. For multiple lesions, the total amount of cream used per session should not exceed 1 gram.

**Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma:**  Up to a maximum of 2 grams of cream (the entire tube) is applied to all lesions combined for each treatment session, followed by red light illumination after three hours of occlusion. Treatment is repeated in one week. Additional treatment sessions may be considered after 3 months and if needed, up to two more treatment sessions separated by one week can be given.  Use without subsequent red light illumination is not recommended.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of methyl aminolevulinate in children under 18 years old have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, according to the manufacturer's labeling.  However, always consult a physician for any adjustments if you have a health concern.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (more than 10% of patients):**

* Local discomfort (nervous system)
* Burning sensation, skin pain, erythema (redness), crusted skin, blistering, erosion, itching (pruritus), and skin peeling (exfoliation) (dermatologic)
* Skin swelling (edema) (local)
* Eyelid swelling (edema) (ophthalmic)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10% of patients):**

* Localized warm feeling (nervous system)
* Dermal hemorrhage (bleeding under the skin), hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), skin tightness (dermatologic)
* Application-site discharge (local)


**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Angioedema (swelling of the skin and mucous membranes), contact dermatitis, eczema, facial edema, infection at the application site, keratitis (inflammation of the cornea), macular edema (swelling of the macula in the eye), squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer), urticaria (hives), and vitreous detachment (separation of the vitreous gel from the retina).


If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Methyl aminolevulinate is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into an active form in the body.  It's metabolized into photoactive porphyrins (PAPs), which accumulate in the targeted skin lesions. When exposed to specific red light, these PAPs trigger a photodynamic reaction. This reaction produces singlet oxygen, which damages and destroys the abnormal skin cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methyl aminolevulinate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or any of its components (including peanut and almond oil), cutaneous photosensitivity, porphyria, or morpheaform basal cell carcinoma.  It has not been fully tested on patients with peanut allergies.
* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of photosensitivity.  Avoid sun exposure and bright light for a period of time after treatment, following your physician's instruction. The preparation is for external use only and should not be applied to the eyes or mucous membranes. The application should be performed by a qualified healthcare professional. 
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently reported. However, always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Methyl aminolevulinate is classified as Category C in pregnancy. The safety of use during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established; it should only be used if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risks.
* **Other precautions:**  Methyl aminolevulinate has not been extensively studied in patients with immunosuppression, pigmented AKs, or inherited or acquired coagulation disorders.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment take?** A: Treatment involves application of the cream, occlusion, and red light therapy, with the process potentially repeated after a week. The total time for a session and the overall treatment duration will be decided by your physician.  
* **Q: How should I store methyl aminolevulinate?** A: Store the cream at room temperature, protected from light and moisture, as instructed on the product label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  This is not applicable to methyl aminolevulinate as the treatment is administered by a healthcare professional.  Consult your doctor regarding your treatment plan.
* **Q: Is methyl aminolevulinate safe for long-term use?** A:  The long-term safety of methyl aminolevulinate has not been fully established. Treatment courses are usually limited.   Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment plan for your specific case.
