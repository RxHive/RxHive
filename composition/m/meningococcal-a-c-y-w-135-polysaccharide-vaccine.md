# Meningococcal A C Y W 135 Polysaccharide Vaccine
### Generic Name
Meningococcal A C Y W 135 Polysaccharide Vaccine (MPSV4)

### Usage
This vaccine is used to prevent meningococcal disease caused by bacteria with serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135.  Meningococcal disease is a serious infection that can cause meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) and septicemia (blood poisoning).  It's primarily used for the prevention of these diseases, particularly in individuals at increased risk of infection.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends specific usage guidelines based on age and risk factors.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥18 years):** A single subcutaneous (subQ) injection of 0.5 mL is recommended.

**Children (≥2 years):**  A single subQ injection of 0.5 mL is recommended.  The dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):** Anorexia, arthralgia (joint pain), diarrhea, fatigue, headache, induration (hardening at the injection site), malaise (general discomfort), pain at the injection site, redness at the injection site, swelling at the injection site.

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):** Chills, fever, rashes, vomiting.

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (Frequency not Defined):** Dizziness, Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder), myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, paresthesia (numbness or tingling), vasovagal syncope (fainting), weakness, and hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions).

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

This vaccine is a polysaccharide vaccine. It works by introducing weakened forms of the bacterial polysaccharides (sugars) from the A, C, Y, and W-135 meningococcal bacteria into the body.  This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that specifically target these bacteria. These antibodies provide protection against future infection by these serogroups of *Neisseria meningitidis*.  It provides active immunity, meaning the body learns to defend itself.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** This vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to any component of the vaccine, or those with an acute illness.

**Warnings:** Use caution in severely immunocompromised individuals, those with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or bleeding disorders.  There is an increased risk of anaphylactoid reactions, syncope, seizures, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, although these are rare.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** This vaccine is classified as Category C during pregnancy.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution.

**Drug Interactions:**  Belimumab (a medication used to treat lupus) can decrease the effectiveness of this vaccine and increase the risk of infections. Concomitant use is generally not recommended.

**General Considerations:** The vaccine can be administered without regard to food.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does the protection from this vaccine last?**
A: The duration of protection varies, but it is generally considered to be several years.  Booster doses may be recommended depending on individual risk factors and public health recommendations.

**Q:  Can this vaccine protect against all types of meningococcal disease?**
A: No, this vaccine only protects against meningococcal disease caused by serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135.  Other serogroups, such as B, exist and may require separate vaccination.

**Q: What should I do if I experience a serious side effect after receiving the vaccine?**
A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or severe allergic reactions.

**Q: How is the vaccine stored?**
A:  Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions.  Generally, vaccines should be stored at appropriate refrigerated temperatures to maintain their potency.

**Q:  Is this vaccine safe for children?**
A: The vaccine is generally safe for children aged 2 years and older, although specific recommendations should be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Q: Who should receive this vaccine?**
A:  This vaccine is recommended for individuals at increased risk of meningococcal disease, such as those traveling to areas with high rates of infection, those with weakened immune systems, or those in close contact with someone who has the disease. Consult a doctor to determine suitability.
