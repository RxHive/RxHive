# Medroxyprogesterone
### Generic Name
Medroxyprogesterone

### Usage

Medroxyprogesterone is a progestin hormone used for several indications. Its primary use is as a contraceptive, preventing pregnancy in women of reproductive age.  The injectable form is particularly effective in long-term contraception.  Beyond contraception, medroxyprogesterone is also used to treat:

* **Abnormal uterine bleeding:**  This includes irregular, heavy, or prolonged menstrual bleeding caused by hormonal imbalances.  It helps regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce bleeding.

* **Secondary amenorrhea:** This refers to the absence of menstrual periods in women who have previously menstruated, often due to hormonal disruptions. Medroxyprogesterone can help restore regular periods.

* **Endometriosis-associated pain:** This medication can alleviate pain associated with endometriosis, a condition where uterine tissue grows outside the uterus.  Injectable forms are commonly used for this purpose.

* **Endometrial hyperplasia:** Medroxyprogesterone is used to prevent or treat the thickening of the uterine lining (endometrium), which can be a precursor to cancer.

* **Endometrial cancer:**  Medroxyprogesterone is sometimes used as an adjunctive therapy (in combination with other treatments) or palliative treatment for inoperable, recurrent, or metastatic endometrial cancer.  It helps slow the growth of the cancer cells.


It's important to note that medroxyprogesterone has also been used off-label for conditions like treating hot flashes, paraphilia/hypersexuality, and acute abnormal uterine bleeding; however, its effectiveness and safety for these uses haven't been as extensively studied.

### Dosage

Medroxyprogesterone comes in various forms, including oral tablets and injectable suspensions (IM and subcutaneous). Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the form of the medication.  **Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.**  The following are general examples and should not be interpreted as a prescription:


* **Contraception (Injectable):**  Typically 150 mg intramuscularly (IM) every 3 months or 104 mg subcutaneously (SubQ) every 3 months.  The first injection timing is crucial and should be guided by a healthcare provider.

* **Contraception (Oral):**  This route is less common for contraception.

* **Abnormal Uterine Bleeding/Secondary Amenorrhea (Oral):** Usually 5-10 mg daily for 5-10 days, starting on a specific day of the menstrual cycle (often day 16 or 21).

* **Endometriosis (Injectable):**  Often 104 mg subcutaneously every 3 months for up to 2 years.

* **Endometrial Cancer (Injectable):**  Higher doses (400-1000 mg/week IM) are typically used in this context.


Pediatric dosage is generally similar to adult dosage for conditions like abnormal uterine bleeding or amenorrhea, but use before menarche is not recommended.  Dosage for adolescents should always be determined by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects

Medroxyprogesterone can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to serious.  The frequency and severity can vary significantly between individuals.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nervousness
* Abdominal pain
* Changes in menstrual flow (amenorrhea, spotting)
* Weight changes (gain or loss)
* Breast tenderness
* Mood changes (depression, anxiety)
* Fatigue


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
* Stroke
* Heart attack
* Increased risk of certain cancers (breast, endometrial)
* Bone loss (osteoporosis, especially with long-term injectable use)
* Liver problems


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Medroxyprogesterone is a synthetic form of progesterone, a female hormone.  Its primary mechanism of action is suppressing the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This subsequently reduces the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. The lower levels of FSH and LH prevent ovulation (the release of an egg), thus achieving contraceptive effects.  For other conditions, such as endometriosis and abnormal uterine bleeding, it works by altering the hormonal balance in the body, thereby impacting the function of the uterus and reducing bleeding.  In endometrial cancer, it can inhibit the growth of cancer cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Medroxyprogesterone is contraindicated in individuals with a history of breast cancer, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease, blood clots, or known or suspected pregnancy. It's also not recommended for long-term use (more than 2 years) as a contraceptive or for treating endometriosis due to the risk of bone loss.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Certain medications, such as enzyme-inducing drugs, can interact with medroxyprogesterone, potentially reducing its effectiveness.

* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant or breastfeeding women should exercise extreme caution when considering medroxyprogesterone.  The medication is categorized as Pregnancy Category X (contraindicated during pregnancy) and passes into breast milk.  Older adults, especially women over 65, might have an increased risk of dementia with combined estrogen-progestin therapy (though this is mostly linked to oral formulations).

* **Other Precautions:** Medroxyprogesterone may increase the risk of blood clots, certain cancers, and bone loss with prolonged use, especially injectable forms. Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.  Individuals with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, epilepsy, or other health conditions should discuss the potential risks and benefits with their doctor before starting this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for medroxyprogesterone to work?**  A:  For contraception, effectiveness begins immediately with the injectable form (timing of first injection is crucial), while oral forms may take a few days to a couple of weeks. For other conditions, the response time varies.

* **Q: Can I stop taking medroxyprogesterone suddenly?** A:  It's generally recommended to follow your doctor's advice on gradually tapering off the medication, especially if you've been using it long-term.

* **Q: How should I store medroxyprogesterone?** A:  Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, according to the instructions on the packaging.

* **Q: Does medroxyprogesterone protect against STIs?** A: No, it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  Use condoms or other barrier methods for STI protection.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose of oral medroxyprogesterone?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if it's close to the time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule.  Don't double up on doses.

* **Q:  Can I get pregnant while using medroxyprogesterone?** A: While medroxyprogesterone is highly effective as a contraceptive, no birth control method is 100% effective.  There's a small chance of pregnancy.
