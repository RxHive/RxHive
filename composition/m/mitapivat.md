# Mitapivat
### Generic Name
Mitapivat

### Usage

Mitapivat is primarily used to treat hemolytic anemia in adults with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency.  This condition involves a malfunction in red blood cells due to a deficiency in the enzyme pyruvate kinase, leading to their premature destruction and resulting in anemia (low red blood cell count).  Mitapivat works by boosting the activity of the deficient enzyme, helping red blood cells survive longer and improving anemia symptoms.  There are currently no other notable secondary uses approved.

### Dosage

**Adults (Hemolytic Anemia):**  Mitapivat is administered orally, twice daily (BID). The starting dose is 5 mg BID.  This dose is gradually increased, based on individual response and monitoring of hemoglobin levels and hemolysis markers,  up to a maximum of 50 mg BID according to a specific titration schedule (see details below). Treatment should be discontinued (gradually tapered) if no benefit is seen within 24 weeks, as determined by hemoglobin levels, hemolysis markers, and transfusion needs.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of mitapivat in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Mitapivat should be avoided in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  No dosage adjustment is specifically provided for those with mild impairment.

* **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is explicitly recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²).  Use in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment is not fully defined and requires careful consideration from a healthcare provider.


**Titration Schedule (Adult):**

* **Weeks 1-4:** 5 mg BID
* **Weeks 5-8:** If hemoglobin is below the normal range or a transfusion was needed in the past 8 weeks, increase to 20 mg BID.  Maintain this dose for 4 weeks. If hemoglobin is within the normal range and no transfusion was required, maintain 5 mg BID.
* **Weeks 9-12:** If hemoglobin is below the normal range or a transfusion was needed in the past 8 weeks, increase to 50 mg BID and continue at this dose. If hemoglobin is within the normal range and no transfusion was required, maintain the current dose (either 5 mg BID or 20 mg BID).
* **Maintenance:** If hemoglobin decreases, consider increasing the dose to 50 mg BID according to the schedule above.

**Dose Tapering Schedule (Adult):**

This schedule should be followed if discontinuation of Mitapivat is necessary.  However, in cases where the risk of an adverse reaction or high hemoglobin outweighs the risk of acute hemolysis,  Mitapivat can be stopped immediately, but close monitoring for acute hemolysis is essential. The tapering schedule varies based on current dosage:

* 5 mg BID: Days 1-7, 5 mg once daily (OD). Day 8 and onwards, discontinue.
* 20 mg BID: Days 1-7, 20 mg OD; Days 8-14, 5 mg OD. Day 15, discontinue.
* 50 mg BID: Days 1-7, 50 mg OD; Days 8-14, 20 mg OD. Day 15, discontinue.


**Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions/High Hemoglobin:** If a dose reduction is needed due to an adverse reaction or hemoglobin levels above the normal range,  reduce to the next lower dose (20 mg BID or 5 mg BID).

**Drug Interactions:** Dosage recommendations must be adjusted in the presence of certain drug interactions (see Interactions section below).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Decreased estrone (males)
* Decreased estradiol (males)
* Back pain

**Other Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Increased blood testosterone (males)
* Hypertriglyceridemia
* Hypertension
* Arrhythmia
* Gastroenteritis
* Constipation
* Dry mouth
* Arthralgia
* Hot flush
* Oropharyngeal pain
* Breast discomfort
* Paresthesia

**Serious, but Less Common Side Effects:**  Grade 3 or higher (severe) side effects include hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and gastroenteritis.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Mitapivat is a pyruvate kinase activator.  Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme crucial for red blood cell energy production.  In pyruvate kinase deficiency, mutations in the enzyme reduce its activity, leading to reduced energy within the red blood cells.  This results in their premature destruction and anemia.  Mitapivat binds to the enzyme, increasing its activity and energy production, thereby improving red blood cell survival and reducing anemia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Currently, no specific contraindications are listed by the manufacturer.

* **Drug Interactions:** Mitapivat is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, specifically CYP3A.  Therefore,  it can interact with other medications that are metabolized by CYP3A or that affect CYP3A activity.  Specifically, strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided.  Moderate CYP3A inhibitors require careful monitoring, and dose adjustments to Mitapivat may be required (see Dosage Adjustments).  Similarly, the co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers needs careful consideration and may require dose adjustments. Mitapivat can also induce other CYP enzymes and UGT1A1, potentially decreasing the effectiveness of certain medications. It can also inhibit the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter, potentially increasing the levels of P-gp substrates.  Consult a healthcare provider or pharmacist for guidance on potential interactions with other medications.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  There is insufficient data on the effects of mitapivat during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The potential risks and benefits should be carefully considered.

* **Acute Hemolysis Risk:** Abrupt discontinuation of mitapivat can increase the risk of acute hemolysis and subsequent worsening of anemia.  Always follow the prescribed tapering schedule unless medically contraindicated.

* **Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of hemoglobin levels is crucial during treatment to assess response and to detect any worsening of anemia or signs of acute hemolysis.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take mitapivat with food?**  A: Yes, mitapivat can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If a dose is missed by less than 4 hours, take it as soon as possible. If more than 4 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and resume your regular schedule.

* **Q: How should I store mitapivat?** A: Store mitapivat tablets according to the instructions on the label. This usually involves storage at room temperature and protection from moisture.

* **Q: Is mitapivat safe for children?** A: The safety and effectiveness of mitapivat in children have not been established.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any side effects.
