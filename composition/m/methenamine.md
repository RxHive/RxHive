# Methenamine
### Generic Name
Methenamine

### Usage
Methenamine, available as methenamine hippurate and methenamine mandelate, is primarily used for the prevention or suppression of recurring urinary tract infections (UTIs).  It's crucial to understand that methenamine is *not* a treatment for active UTIs; it's used *after* an infection has been successfully treated with another antimicrobial medication to help prevent the infection from returning.  Methenamine is only effective in the lower urinary tract and should not be used for infections in other parts of the body.  Its effectiveness relies on maintaining an acidic urine environment.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Methenamine hippurate:**  Typically 1 gram (1000 mg) twice daily (BID).
* **Methenamine mandelate:** Usually 1 gram (1000 mg) four times daily (QID), taken with meals and at bedtime.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage varies significantly depending on the child's age and weight.  It's essential to consult a pediatrician or follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  Generally, methenamine mandelate is more commonly used in children.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dose based on the child's weight and age.  Always follow the prescribed dosage meticulously.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild-to-moderate liver impairment.  It's contraindicated in those with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Methenamine is contraindicated in patients with kidney impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:** These are generally mild and may include:

* Skin rash or itching
* Upset stomach (dyspepsia), nausea, or vomiting


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST). These are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the medication.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, even if not listed here, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Methenamine is a urinary antiseptic.  In acidic urine, it breaks down into formaldehyde and ammonia. Formaldehyde is the active ingredient that possesses bactericidal (bacteria-killing) properties.  The hippuric acid or mandelic acid components of the different forms of methenamine help to maintain the acidic urine environment necessary for formaldehyde to be effective.  Without this acidic environment, methenamine is ineffective.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methenamine should not be used if you have a known allergy to methenamine or any of its components, severe dehydration, severe kidney or liver problems, or are currently taking sulfonamide medications.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Methenamine can interact with various medications, including antacids, alkalinizing agents (which make urine less acidic), and certain antibiotics.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Methenamine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its safety during pregnancy has not been fully established. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It's excreted in breast milk.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution in elderly individuals, due to potential age-related decline in liver and kidney function.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for methenamine to work?** A:  Methenamine is preventative, not a cure for an active infection. Its effect is gradual, helping to prevent recurrence.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.


* **Q: How should I store methenamine?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.


* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking methenamine?** A: Alcohol isn't explicitly contraindicated, but it's advisable to check with your doctor or pharmacist, as alcohol can sometimes affect medication metabolism and increase the risk of side effects.


* **Q:  Is methenamine effective against all types of UTIs?** A: No.  Its effectiveness depends on maintaining acidic urine, and it's primarily used for prophylaxis (prevention) after an infection has been treated, not as a primary treatment for a current UTI.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate medication based on your specific infection and its causative organism.
