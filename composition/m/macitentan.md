# Macitentan
### Generic Name
Macitentan

### Usage
Macitentan is primarily used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), specifically WHO Group 1 PAH.  It's prescribed to slow the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of hospitalization due to PAH-related complications.  While not its primary indication, it may offer some benefit in reducing symptoms associated with PAH.

### Dosage
**Adults (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension):** The usual starting dose is 10 mg once daily by mouth. This is also the maximum recommended daily dose.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of macitentan in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment. However,  if baseline serum ALT or AST levels are more than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), starting macitentan isn't recommended.  For mild impairment, no dosage adjustment may be necessary; however, for moderate to severe impairment, use is generally not recommended.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is provided in the manufacturer's labeling for renal impairment.  Use is not recommended in patients requiring dialysis.

The medication should be swallowed whole; do not crush, chew, or break the tablets. Macitentan can be taken with or without food.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Anemia
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold), pharyngitis (sore throat), and bronchitis

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% or less, including post-marketing reports):**

* Urinary tract infection
* Decreased hemoglobin levels
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT and AST)
* Influenza
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Edema (swelling)
* Fluid retention
* Hepatic insufficiency (liver failure)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Nasal congestion
* Pruritus (itching)
* Rash
* Symptomatic hypotension (low blood pressure causing symptoms)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially those listed as potentially serious, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist.  Endothelin is a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict (narrow).  Macitentan blocks the action of endothelin by preventing it from binding to its receptors (ETA and ETB receptors) in the pulmonary arteries.  By blocking endothelin, macitentan helps to relax and widen the blood vessels in the lungs, improving blood flow and reducing pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This helps alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Macitentan is contraindicated (absolutely should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to macitentan or its components.
* Pregnancy (Category X drug: poses a significant risk to the fetus).
* Breastfeeding (excretion in breast milk is unknown).


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* **Pregnancy:** Macitentan is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm.  Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment, monthly during treatment, and one month after stopping treatment.  Reliable contraception is mandatory throughout treatment and for one month afterward.  A risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program is in place to manage these risks.
* **Liver Function:**  Macitentan can affect liver function; regular monitoring of liver enzymes (ALT and AST) is necessary.  Increased liver enzyme levels or signs of liver damage necessitate immediate medical attention.
* **Fluid Retention:** Macitentan can cause fluid retention and peripheral edema (swelling).  Patients should be monitored for these effects.
* **Anemia:** Macitentan can cause anemia (low red blood cell count).  Hemoglobin levels should be monitored.
* **Drug Interactions:** Macitentan's metabolism can be affected by other medications. Consult your doctor about potential interactions, especially with strong CYP3A4 inducers (which decrease macitentan levels) or inhibitors (which increase macitentan levels).  Careful consideration is needed when using it with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors used in HIV treatment, possibly requiring alternative PAH therapies.
* **Severe Chronic Heart Failure:** Use with caution in patients with severe chronic heart failure.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take macitentan with food?** A: Yes, macitentan can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How should I store macitentan?** A: Store macitentan at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Follow the specific instructions provided on the label.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.  Contact your doctor for advice.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking macitentan?** A:  While not explicitly contraindicated, it's advisable to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor. Alcohol could potentially exacerbate side effects or interact with the medication.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed as potentially serious.
