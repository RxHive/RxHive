# Mercaptopurine
### Generic Name
Mercaptopurine

### Usage

Mercaptopurine is primarily used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), typically as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen, particularly during maintenance therapy after initial treatment phases like induction and consolidation.  Its role is to help prevent the leukemia from returning.

Importantly, mercaptopurine also sees off-label use in managing certain inflammatory bowel diseases.  This includes Crohn's disease, where it might be employed after surgery to help maintain remission or in combination with other medications like anti-TNF agents.  It's also sometimes used in ulcerative colitis, both to induce remission and to maintain it after remission is achieved.  Other off-label uses include treating autoimmune hepatitis and lymphoblastic lymphoma.  These off-label uses often involve careful monitoring and dosage adjustments.


### Dosage

Dosage of mercaptopurine varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and other medications they're taking.  Precise dosing is determined by a healthcare professional and is often tailored to individual needs.

**Adults:** Dosages range from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg per day orally for ALL maintenance therapy.  For Crohn's disease, off-label dosages vary significantly depending on the treatment goal (maintenance, remission induction, etc.), and often involve combinations of other medications.  Similarly, for other off-label uses, dosage and regimen vary depending on several factors.

**Children:**  Pediatric dosages are usually calculated based on body surface area (mg/mÂ²) and are significantly different across various ALL treatment phases (consolidation, interim maintenance, maintenance). Dosing in children with other conditions also needs careful individualization by a physician.  Always refer to the specific treatment protocol for exact guidelines.


**Dosage Forms:** Mercaptopurine is available in oral tablet and suspension forms.

**Administration:**  Oral tablets should ideally be taken on an empty stomach, avoiding milk products if possible.  The suspension form requires vigorous shaking before administration.  A healthcare provider will provide clear instructions on administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Anorexia
* Myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression leading to low blood cell counts)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Rash

Less common but serious side effects include:

* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Severe liver damage
* Secondary malignancies (new cancers)

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Mercaptopurine is a type of antimetabolite called a purine analog.  It interferes with the production of DNA and RNA, essential components for cell growth and reproduction.  In ALL, it works by selectively targeting and slowing the growth of rapidly dividing leukemia cells. In inflammatory bowel diseases, its mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to suppress the immune system's overactive response that contributes to inflammation.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not use mercaptopurine if allergic to it or any of its components.
* **Liver & Kidney Function:**  Mercaptopurine is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function require careful monitoring and dose adjustments.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:**  Mercaptopurine can suppress bone marrow, leading to low blood cell counts.  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor this.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Mercaptopurine can cause liver damage.  Regular liver function tests are crucial.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Mercaptopurine can interact with many other drugs, including allopurinol, other myelosuppressive agents, and certain hepatotoxic drugs.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications being taken.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Mercaptopurine is categorized as pregnancy category D (risk to the fetus is possible).  It's not recommended during pregnancy unless strictly necessary.  Breastfeeding is generally not advised during treatment.
* **Genetic Variations:** Genetic variations in enzymes that metabolize mercaptopurine (TPMT and NUDT15) can significantly affect how the body handles the drug, impacting both efficacy and risk of side effects. Genetic testing may be recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take mercaptopurine with food?** A: Ideally, it should be taken on an empty stomach. However, if this is difficult, adjustments may be made under physician guidance.  Always follow your healthcare provider's specific instructions.

* **Q: How long will I need to take mercaptopurine?** A: The duration of treatment depends entirely on the condition being treated and your response to therapy.  Your healthcare provider will determine this.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider for guidance on what to do if a dose is missed.

* **Q: How should I store mercaptopurine?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist or healthcare provider. Typically, this involves storing at room temperature away from light and moisture.
