# Mitotane
### Generic Name
Mitotane

### Usage
Mitotane is primarily used to treat inoperable adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer affecting the adrenal glands.  While not its primary indication, it's also sometimes used off-label in the management of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by excessive cortisol production.  In adrenocortical carcinoma, Mitotane aims to control the cancer's growth and improve patient outcomes.  In Cushing's syndrome, its role is to suppress cortisol overproduction.  It's crucial to understand that the use of Mitotane in Cushing's syndrome is off-label, meaning it's not officially approved by regulatory bodies for this purpose.

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  It's always determined and adjusted by a physician based on individual needs and blood levels of the medication.

**Adrenocortical Carcinoma:**  The typical starting oral dose for adults ranges from 2 to 6 grams daily, divided into 3-4 doses. The dose is then carefully increased over time, aiming for a blood concentration of 14-20 mcg/mL, or as tolerated by the patient.  Alternatively, some clinicians may start with a lower daily dose (1-2 grams) and gradually increase it by 1-2 grams every 1-2 weeks, up to a maximum of 6-10 grams daily.  This higher range is considered off-label dosing.

**Cushing's Syndrome (off-label):**  Adult treatment often begins with 500 mg three times a day. The dose may be increased rapidly during the first 4-6 weeks, up to a maximum of 4000-8000 mg/day in three divided doses, with the largest dose given in the evening.  Once cortisol levels are controlled, the dose is gradually reduced to the lowest effective amount.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of Mitotane in children have not been established.

### Side Effects
Mitotane can cause a range of side effects, some common and others less frequent but potentially serious.

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Anorexia
*   Dizziness
*   Vertigo
*   Depression
*   Skin rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Adrenal insufficiency (requires close monitoring and potentially hormone replacement therapy)
*   Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (lethargy, sedation, confusion, ataxia)
*   Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
*   Ovarian cysts
*   Hypertension
*   Hypothyroidism
*   Prolonged bleeding time
*   Visual disturbances (blurred vision, cataracts)


If any adverse effects occur, it is imperative to contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Mitotane is classified as an adrenolytic agent.  It works primarily by selectively destroying cells in the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands responsible for producing steroid hormones like cortisol and aldosterone. By reducing the production of these hormones, Mitotane can help control the symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma and Cushing's syndrome.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it involves interfering with the synthesis and metabolism of these steroid hormones.

### Precautions
Several precautions should be taken when using Mitotane:

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Mitotane is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
*   **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with liver problems as the drug may accumulate.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Mitotane is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus. Effective contraception is essential during and after treatment.  It's also excreted in breast milk, requiring discontinuation of breastfeeding.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Mitotane is a potent inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme, affecting the metabolism of many other drugs.  Close monitoring is necessary if other medications are being taken concurrently, particularly those metabolized by CYP3A4 (like warfarin).
*   **Adrenal Crisis:**  There's a risk of adrenal crisis, particularly during stressful situations like surgery or severe illness.  Patients should be closely monitored, and prompt treatment with hydrocortisone may be necessary.
*   **Mental Alertness:** Mitotane can cause CNS side effects that might impair alertness.  Patients should avoid activities requiring alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, until they know how the medication affects them.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to see results from Mitotane?**  A: The response to Mitotane varies greatly among individuals.  It can take several weeks or months to see noticeable improvement in symptoms.  Blood levels and clinical response are closely monitored to guide treatment.

*   **Q: How is Mitotane stored?** A: Store Mitotane tablets in a tightly closed container at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

*   **Q: Can I stop taking Mitotane abruptly?** A: No, never stop taking Mitotane without consulting your doctor.  Stopping suddenly can lead to serious complications, including adrenal crisis.  Dosage reduction should always be gradual and under medical supervision.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose to make up for a missed one.
