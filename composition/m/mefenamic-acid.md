# Mefenamic Acid

**Generic Name:** Mefenamic Acid

**Usage:**

Mefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve mild to moderate pain, such as:

* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea): This is a common use.
* Headache
* Muscle aches
* Toothaches
* Post-surgical pain
* Pain associated with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis (though often used alongside stronger NSAIDs for these conditions).

**It's important to note:** Mefenamic acid is not appropriate for all types of pain.  It's crucial to consult a doctor before using it, especially for chronic pain conditions.  They can determine if mefenamic acid is the right treatment and rule out more serious underlying causes.

**Side Effects:**

Mefenamic acid, like other NSAIDs, can cause several side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  These can include:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, constipation, heartburn, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Less Common:**  Headache, rash, itching.
* **Serious (requires immediate medical attention):**  Severe stomach pain, bloody or black stools, signs of allergic reaction (swelling, difficulty breathing, rash), liver problems (jaundice, dark urine), kidney problems (decreased urine output, swelling), ringing in the ears (tinnitus).

The risk of serious side effects is higher with higher doses and longer durations of use.

**How it Works:**

Mefenamic acid works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, mefenamic acid helps to relieve pain and inflammation.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take mefenamic acid with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Mefenamic acid can interact with certain medications, including blood thinners, other NSAIDs, and some antidepressants.
* **How long can I take mefenamic acid?**  Do not take mefenamic acid for longer than recommended by your doctor.  Long-term use increases the risk of side effects.  For menstrual cramps, it's typically used only for the duration of the period.
* **Can I take mefenamic acid if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Generally, mefenamic acid is not recommended during pregnancy, especially during the later stages, or while breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor before use.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Stop taking the medication and contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately if you experience any serious side effects.  For mild side effects, you may want to consult your doctor about whether to continue or stop the medication.
