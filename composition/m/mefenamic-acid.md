# Mefenamic Acid
### Generic Name
Mefenamic Acid

### Usage

Mefenamic acid is a non-opioid analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for the relief of mild to moderate pain in individuals aged 14 years and older.  Treatment should generally not exceed one week (7 days).  A significant secondary use is the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).  It's important to note that mefenamic acid is not suitable for all types of pain and should be used only as directed by a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Pain (mild to moderate):** The typical starting dose is 500 mg, followed by 250 mg every 6 hours as needed. The total daily dose should generally not exceed 1000mg, and treatment shouldn't last longer than a week.  Some regimens may involve 500 mg three times a day.
* **Primary Dysmenorrhea:**  A typical regimen starts with 500 mg at the onset of menstrual bleeding and symptoms, followed by 250 mg every 6 hours, or 500 mg three times a day, usually for no more than three days.

**Children (Always consult a doctor before giving mefenamic acid to a child):**

Dosage for children varies significantly depending on age and weight.  Mefenamic acid suspension is typically used for children. Dosages are calculated based on weight in mg/kg/day and are usually divided into multiple doses.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.  Children under 14 are generally not prescribed this medication unless specifically directed by a physician.

**Administration:**  Mefenamic acid is usually taken orally as a capsule, tablet, or suspension. It's often recommended to take it with food, milk, or an antacid to minimize potential stomach upset.

### How it Works

Mefenamic acid works by reducing the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By inhibiting the enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) responsible for prostaglandin production, mefenamic acid reduces these symptoms.  The exact mechanisms are still being studied, but it also appears to influence other processes like chemotaxis (cell movement) and inflammatory cytokine levels.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mefenamic acid is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, those with a history of asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs, pregnant women in their third trimester, breastfeeding mothers, individuals with severe uncontrolled heart failure, active gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, cerebrovascular bleeding or other bleeding disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, severe hepatic or renal impairment, and those with hyperkalemia.
* **Interactions:** Mefenamic acid can interact with many other drugs, including anticoagulants, other NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and others. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester due to the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. It's contraindicated during breastfeeding as it's excreted in breast milk.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects and require careful monitoring.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Caution is needed in patients with impaired liver or kidney function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
