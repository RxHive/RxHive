# Muscarine
### Generic Name
Muscarine

### Usage
Muscarine, a naturally occurring alkaloid found in certain poisonous mushrooms, is not used therapeutically in modern medicine due to its significant toxicity and unpredictable effects.  While it acts on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, its effects are too unpredictable and dangerous for controlled medical use.  Historically, muscarine's effects on the muscarinic receptors were studied to understand the cholinergic system, and its actions are relevant to understanding the effects of muscarinic agonists and antagonists.  However, this information is largely of academic interest and not relevant to clinical practice.  The information provided below is for educational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for muscarine use.

### Dosage
There is no safe or established dosage of muscarine for human use.  Any ingestion of muscarine-containing mushrooms is extremely dangerous and should be considered a medical emergency.

### Side Effects
Because muscarine's effects are highly variable and depend on the amount ingested, a precise list of side effects is difficult to compile.  However, symptoms of muscarine poisoning can include:

*   Excessive salivation (sialorrhea)
*   Lacrimation (tearing)
*   Sweating (diaphoresis)
*   Bronchospasm (constriction of the airways)
*   Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure)
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Abdominal cramps
*   Blurred vision
*   Urinary urgency


Severe poisoning can lead to respiratory failure and death.

### How it Works
Muscarine acts as an agonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). These receptors are found throughout the body, particularly in the parasympathetic nervous system.  By activating these receptors, muscarine mimics the effects of acetylcholine, leading to the various symptoms described above.  This includes increased activity in organs innervated by the parasympathetic nervous system, resulting in, for example, slowed heart rate, increased bowel and bladder activity, and increased glandular secretions.

### Precautions
The most critical precaution is to **avoid all contact with mushrooms suspected of containing muscarine**.  There is no safe level of muscarine consumption.  Treatment of muscarine poisoning focuses on supportive care, managing symptoms, and potentially using atropine as an antidote to counteract muscarine's effects.

### FAQs

* **Q: Are there any safe uses of muscarine?**  A: No.  Muscarine is extremely toxic and should never be ingested.

* **Q: What should I do if I suspect muscarine poisoning?** A: Seek immediate medical attention. This is a medical emergency.

* **Q: Is there an antidote for muscarine poisoning?** A: Atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, can be used to counteract some of muscarine's effects, but treatment is primarily supportive care.

* **Q: How is muscarine stored?** A:  This question is irrelevant as muscarine should not be possessed or stored by anyone outside of a strictly controlled research setting.

Ingestion of wild mushrooms is inherently risky and should be avoided.
