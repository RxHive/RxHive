# Mumps Skin Test Antigen
### Generic Name
Mumps Skin Test Antigen

### Usage
Mumps skin test antigen is a diagnostic tool used to detect a delayed hypersensitivity (DH) reaction, suggesting previous infection with the mumps virus.  It's a test to see if your immune system has encountered the mumps virus before, not a test for active mumps infection.  It's important to note that a positive reaction doesn't definitively confirm past mumps infection, and a negative result doesn't guarantee absence of prior infection.  This test is primarily used in situations where a history of mumps infection needs to be assessed,  though its reliability is limited.


### Dosage
**Mumps Skin Test:**

* **Administration:** The test involves an intradermal injection of 0.1 mL of the antigen into the inner surface of the forearm.
* **Evaluation:** The injection site should be examined after 48-72 hours.  A positive reaction is defined as an area of induration (hardening) with a mean diameter (average of longest width and length) of 5 mm or more.
* **Interpretation:** A positive reaction suggests prior exposure to the mumps virus. A negative reaction, if administered correctly, may indicate a lack of prior exposure or immune deficiency.  A false positive can occur in individuals with high sensitivity to egg protein (as the antigen is produced in chicken embryos).
* **Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of this skin test have not been established in children or young adults who have received the mumps vaccine.


### Side Effects
* Local reactions (tenderness, itching, blistering)
* Rash
* Tissue damage (sloughing, necrosis, abscess formation)
* Nausea
* Loss of appetite (anorexia)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Sweating
* Feeling of warmth
* Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy)

**Serious, though less common, side effects include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or a rapid heartbeat.**


### How it Works
The mumps skin test antigen detects delayed hypersensitivity.  A positive reaction indicates that the immune system has previously encountered the mumps virus and has developed a cell-mediated immune response.  This response involves T-cells recognizing the viral antigen and initiating an inflammatory reaction at the injection site, resulting in the observable induration.


### Precautions
* **Contraindication:** This test is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to egg protein, as the antigen is derived from chicken embryos.
* **Allergic Reactions:** There is an increased risk of allergic or anaphylactic reactions. Epinephrine should be readily available for immediate treatment should a reaction occur.
* **Injection Technique:**  Accurate intradermal injection is crucial for reliable results; subcutaneous injection may yield unreliable results.
* **Blood Vessels:** Care must be taken to avoid injecting into a blood vessel.
* **Mumps Vaccine:** The test has not been evaluated in individuals previously vaccinated against mumps; therefore, its reliability in this population is unknown.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of this test during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Consult with a healthcare professional before using this test if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: What does a positive skin test mean?** A: A positive test suggests prior exposure to the mumps virus, but it's not a definitive confirmation of past infection.

* **Q: What does a negative skin test mean?** A: A negative test may indicate a lack of previous exposure or an impaired immune response. However, it does not definitively rule out past infection.

* **Q: What should I do if I have a reaction to the test?** A: Monitor the injection site for any unusual changes. If you experience any severe symptoms like difficulty breathing or swelling, seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: How is the test stored?** A: Refer to the product labeling for specific storage instructions. Generally, it requires refrigeration.

* **Q: Is this test reliable?** A: The reliability of the mumps skin test is limited.  It is not a highly sensitive or specific test for past mumps infection.  Other diagnostic methods might be preferred to confirm mumps infection.

* **Q: Can I use this test to diagnose active mumps infection?** A: No, this is not a test for active mumps infection.  Different diagnostic methods are used to detect active mumps infection.
