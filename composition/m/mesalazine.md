# Mesalazine
### Generic Name
Mesalazine

### Usage

Mesalazine is primarily used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.  Its main function is to reduce inflammation in the digestive tract.  For ulcerative colitis, mesalazine is often a first-line treatment, helping to control symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and urgency. In Crohn's disease, it's typically used to maintain remission (preventing flare-ups) and can sometimes be helpful in managing active disease, though it's often less effective than other medications for inducing remission in Crohn's.  It's important to note that mesalazine doesn't cure IBD; it manages the symptoms and helps prevent flare-ups.  Certain formulations may also be used to treat proctitis (inflammation of the rectum).


### Dosage

Mesalazine dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated, the severity of the disease, the patient's age and weight, and the formulation of the medication.  Dosage should always be determined and monitored by a physician.  There isn't a universal "one size fits all" dosage.

**Oral:**  Dosage forms include tablets, capsules, and granules/suspensions. Doses typically range from 1-4 grams per day, divided into multiple doses. Children's doses are significantly lower and are always determined by a physician based on weight and age.

**IV:** Mesalazine is not typically administered intravenously (IV).  Intravenous medications are generally used when oral administration is not feasible or when rapid treatment is needed, and this isn't the case with mesalazine which is designed for targeted action in the gut.


**Important Note:** The specific dosage regimen, including the form of medication, frequency, and duration of treatment will be determined by your doctor.  Strictly adhere to the prescribed dosage and instructions.  Do not alter the dosage or stop taking the medication without consulting your physician.



### Side Effects

Common side effects of mesalazine include:

* Nausea
* Headache
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine)

* Bone marrow suppression (reduced blood cell counts)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Mesalazine is an aminosalicylate, a type of anti-inflammatory drug. It works by reducing inflammation in the digestive tract. The exact mechanism isn't completely understood, but it's believed to work by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators and by influencing the immune response within the gut. This helps to reduce symptoms associated with IBD such as pain, diarrhea, and bleeding.  The drug is designed to target the inflamed areas of the intestines, minimizing systemic side effects.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Do not take mesalazine if you are allergic to it or to any of its components (such as sulfasalazine).
* **Kidney Disease:** Mesalazine can affect kidney function, so it should be used with caution in patients with existing kidney problems. Regular monitoring of kidney function might be necessary.
* **Liver Disease:** Mesalazine can also affect liver function, requiring careful monitoring in those with liver conditions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of mesalazine during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor, balancing the benefits to the mother against potential risks to the fetus or infant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Mesalazine can interact with certain other medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Sulfasalazine Sensitivity:**  Patients who have had allergic reactions to sulfasalazine might also be allergic to mesalazine.
