# Mecetronium

I cannot find any information about a drug called "Mecetronium" in any reputable medical databases or pharmaceutical literature.  It's possible that:

* **The name is misspelled or slightly different:** There might be a similar-sounding drug with a slightly different spelling.
* **It's a very rare or experimental drug:**  Drugs in early stages of development or used only in very specific circumstances might not have widespread documentation.
* **It's a fictional drug:** The name might be from a book, movie, or other fictional work.

If you can provide more information, such as the condition it's used for or where you encountered this name, I might be able to help you find the correct information.
