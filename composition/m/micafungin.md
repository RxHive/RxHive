# Micafungin
### Generic Name
Micafungin

### Usage
Micafungin is an antifungal medication used intravenously (IV) to treat serious infections caused by *Candida* species, a type of yeast.  Its primary use is in treating invasive candidiasis, which includes conditions like candidemia (Candida in the bloodstream), acute disseminated candidiasis (widespread Candida infection), and Candida peritonitis (Candida infection of the lining of the abdomen).  Micafungin is also used to treat esophageal candidiasis (Candida infection of the esophagus) and is sometimes used for prophylaxis (prevention) of *Candida* infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), where the risk of infection is significantly increased.  While not its primary indication, micafungin is sometimes used off-label in the treatment of infections caused by *Candida auris*, a particularly drug-resistant species.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The typical adult dose is 100mg once daily (OD) for candidemia, acute disseminated candidiasis, Candida peritonitis, and Candida abscesses. For esophageal candidiasis, the dose is usually 150mg OD.  For prophylaxis in HSCT recipients, the dose is 50mg OD.  The duration of treatment varies depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's response, typically ranging from 10 to 47 days.  The medication is administered as a one-hour intravenous infusion.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage in children (4 months and older) is determined by weight, typically 2mg/kg/day for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, up to a maximum of 100mg/day. For esophageal candidiasis, the dose varies based on weight (3mg/kg/day for those weighing ≤30kg; 2.5mg/kg/day up to 150mg/day for those >30kg).  Prophylaxis in pediatric HSCT recipients is 1mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 50mg/day.  The safety and efficacy of micafungin haven't been fully established for all types of *Candida* infections and in children younger than 4 months; higher doses might be required for more severe infections in this age group.  All pediatric doses are administered via intravenous infusion over one hour.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are usually needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Micafungin is an echinocandin antifungal.  It works by inhibiting the synthesis of β(1,3)-D-glucan, a crucial component of the fungal cell wall.  By disrupting the cell wall's integrity, micafungin causes the fungal cells to become osmotically unstable and lyse (break open), leading to the death of the fungal cells.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Micafungin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to micafungin or other echinocandins.

**Interactions:**  Concomitant use with other medications, such as amphotericin B, sirolimus, nifedipine, and itraconazole, may alter their levels and efficacy; therefore close monitoring is required or alternative medications may be preferred.

**Warnings:** Micafungin should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Close monitoring of liver and kidney function is recommended during treatment.  The use of micafungin during pregnancy and lactation should be carefully considered, weighing potential benefits against risks.  Other antifungal medications are generally preferred during pregnancy.
