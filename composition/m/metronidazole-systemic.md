# Metronidazole (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Metronidazole (Systemic)

### Usage

Metronidazole is a systemic antibiotic belonging to the nitroimidazole class.  Its primary use is in treating various bacterial and parasitic infections.  Specifically, it's effective against anaerobic bacteria and certain protozoa.  Key uses include:

* **Infections caused by anaerobic bacteria:**  This includes intra-abdominal infections, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), bacterial vaginosis, and certain types of pneumonia (like aspiration pneumonia).  It's also used in the treatment of bite wound infections and as prophylaxis (prevention) in certain surgical procedures where anaerobic bacteria are a concern.  Metronidazole may be part of a combination therapy for these conditions, often used alongside other antibiotics to broaden the spectrum of coverage.

* **Parasitic infections:** Metronidazole effectively treats infections caused by parasites such as *Trichomonas vaginalis* (trichomoniasis), *Entamoeba histolytica* (amebiasis), and *Giardia lamblia* (giardiasis).  Itâ€™s also sometimes used off-label for other parasitic infections like *Dientamoeba fragilis* and *Balantidium coli*.

* ***Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI):** While not a first-line treatment, Metronidazole is sometimes used to treat mild to moderate CDI, particularly when other antibiotics (like vancomycin or fidaxomicin) are contraindicated or unavailable.  For severe CDI, it's typically used in combination with other therapies.


* **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):**  Metronidazole has off-label use in managing certain aspects of Crohn's disease, particularly perianal fistulas.


It's crucial to understand that Metronidazole treats the infection itself, not the underlying cause. For example, in PID, treating the infection with Metronidazole is necessary but doesn't address potential underlying issues requiring further medical management.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the patient's age and weight, the severity of the infection, and the route of administration (oral, intravenous).  The following are examples and should not be considered a substitute for a healthcare professional's prescription.  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:** Dosage ranges widely from 250mg to 750mg several times a day, for durations ranging from 5 to 10 days, extending to several weeks in some cases (like brain abscesses). Specific regimens for various conditions are outlined in the detailed product information and should be consulted.  Intravenous administration is used for severe infections or when oral medication is not tolerated.

**Children:** Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight (mg/kg/day), typically administered in divided doses throughout the day.  Again, the specific dosage and duration will depend on the infection and the child's age and overall health.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate dosage for a child.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Headache
* Nausea
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, or pain in the extremities)
* Seizures
* Ataxia (loss of coordination)
* Dizziness
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Changes in blood cell counts (leukopenia, neutropenia)
* Liver problems (hepatotoxicity)

**Important:**  This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Metronidazole works by disrupting the DNA of susceptible bacteria and parasites.  Once inside the bacterial or parasitic cell, the drug is reduced, forming active metabolites that damage the DNA, preventing the organism from reproducing and ultimately leading to its death.


### Precautions

* **Alcohol Interaction:**  Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment and for several days after completing the course of Metronidazole. A disulfiram-like reaction (severe nausea, vomiting, headache) can occur.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Metronidazole is generally considered safe to use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks, however, it's contraindicated in the first trimester for the treatment of trichomoniasis. It enters breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should discuss the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with liver or kidney disease may require dosage adjustments.  Close monitoring is essential.
* **Neurological Conditions:**  Patients with a history of seizures or neurological disorders should use Metronidazole with caution, as it can increase the risk of seizures.
* **Drug Interactions:** Metronidazole can interact with several other medications, including anticoagulants, lithium, and some chemotherapy drugs.  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Metronidazole with food?** A:  For immediate-release formulations, taking with food may help reduce stomach upset.  Extended-release formulations should be taken on an empty stomach. Always check your prescription for specific instructions.

* **Q: How should I store Metronidazole?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The time it takes to notice improvement depends on the type and severity of the infection.  You should see improvement within a few days, but complete the entire course as directed by your doctor.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take a double dose.

* **Q: Is Metronidazole safe for long-term use?** A:  Prolonged use is generally not recommended due to the risk of side effects. Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration of treatment.
