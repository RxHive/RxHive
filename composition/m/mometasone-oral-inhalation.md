# Mometasone (Oral inhalation)
### Generic Name
Mometasone (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Mometasone oral inhalation is a corticosteroid medication primarily used for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma.  It's a preventative medication, meaning it helps to control asthma symptoms and prevent attacks, but it's *not* intended for immediate relief of acute asthma symptoms (like sudden wheezing or shortness of breath).  In such cases, a fast-acting bronchodilator is necessary.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** The starting dose and maximum dose depend on the patient's prior asthma treatment and the severity of their condition.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage. Generally:

* **Metered-dose inhaler (MDI):**  Initial doses range from 200 mcg twice daily (BID) to 400 mcg BID, with a maximum daily dose of 800 mcg.  The specific starting dose depends on prior treatment.
* **Dry powder inhaler (DPI):** Initial doses range from 220 mcg once daily (OD) to 440 mcg BID, with a maximum daily dose of 880 mcg. Again, the starting dose depends on the patient's history.  Dosages may be adjusted after 2 weeks if adequate control isn't achieved.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children varies considerably based on age and prior treatments.  A healthcare provider will determine the correct dose for the child. Generally, it's lower than adult dosages. Dry powder inhalers are often used in older children and adolescents.  Specific dosages are available in the product information.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, however, a healthcare provider should always be made aware of these conditions.


**Administration:**  Instructions for using both MDIs and DPIs will be provided with the medication and should be followed precisely.  With MDIs, rinse the mouth with water after each use (without swallowing) to minimize the risk of oral thrush (candidiasis).


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Depression
* Sinusitis
* Upper respiratory tract infections (like colds)
* Sore throat
* Oral thrush (candidiasis) â€“ more likely with MDI use
* Musculoskeletal pain


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma)
* Growth retardation in children
* Adrenal suppression
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Worsening of asthma symptoms
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (wheezing gets worse)


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Mometasone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the airways.  Inflammation is a key factor in asthma. By decreasing airway inflammation, mometasone helps to open up the airways, making breathing easier and preventing asthma attacks.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it involves interactions with multiple cell types and inflammatory mediators in the lungs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mometasone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, active tuberculosis, untreated systemic infections, and ocular herpes simplex.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interactions are possible with certain medications, particularly those that inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme.  A healthcare professional should be informed of all medications being taken.
* **Special Populations:**  Use caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, and older adults.  Children's growth should be monitored.  Older adults may be at increased risk for bone thinning.
* **Other Precautions:**  Patients should be advised not to abruptly stop treatment, and to contact their healthcare provider if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop. Regular monitoring of lung function is typically recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use mometasone for immediate relief of asthma symptoms?**  A: No. Mometasone is a preventative medication, not a rescue medication. Use a fast-acting bronchodilator for immediate relief.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: It may take a week or more to see the full benefit.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: How should I store mometasone?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature away from heat and moisture.

* **Q: Can I use mometasone if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Discuss this with your doctor.  It's generally considered acceptable during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but individual circumstances should be considered.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.
