# Methylnaltrexone
### Generic Name
Methylnaltrexone

### Usage
Methylnaltrexone is primarily used to treat opioid-induced constipation (OIC).  This means it helps relieve constipation caused by taking opioid pain medications.  It's approved for use in two specific patient populations:

* **Patients with advanced illness receiving palliative care:**  In these individuals, methylnaltrexone is used when constipation hasn't responded adequately to laxative treatment.  This is a common issue for those receiving palliative care due to the nature of their illness and the strong pain medications often needed.

* **Adults with chronic non-cancer pain:** This includes individuals with chronic pain related to previous cancer or its treatment, who don't require frequent increases in their opioid dosage.  Methylnaltrexone helps manage the constipation that can be a significant side effect of long-term opioid use for chronic pain.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (subcutaneous injection or oral), the specific indication (advanced illness or chronic non-cancer pain), and patient characteristics such as weight and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's prescription precisely.

**Opioid-induced constipation (advanced illness - subcutaneous injection):**

* Weight <38 kg: 0.15 mg/kg (dose rounded up to the nearest 0.1 mL)
* Weight 38 to <62 kg: 8 mg
* Weight 62-114 kg: 12 mg
* Weight >114 kg: 0.15 mg/kg (dose rounded up to the nearest 0.1 mL)
* Maximum dose: 1 dose per 24 hours; given every other day as needed.


**Opioid-induced constipation (chronic non-cancer pain):**

* **Oral:** 450 mg once daily.
* **Subcutaneous Injection:** 12 mg once daily.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and efficacy of methylnaltrexone in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  These adjustments depend on the severity of the impairment and the route of administration (oral vs. subcutaneous). Consult your physician or pharmacist for precise instructions based on your individual lab results.

### How it Works

Methylnaltrexone is a peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the effects of opioids in the peripheral nervous system (the parts of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord), specifically in the gut.  Opioids bind to mu-opioid receptors in the intestines, slowing down bowel movements and causing constipation. Methylnaltrexone prevents this binding without affecting the opioid's pain-relieving effects in the brain, thus relieving constipation without reducing pain relief.  Its limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier is key to this selective action.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methylnaltrexone is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction or those at increased risk of recurrent obstruction.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of diarrhea, gastrointestinal perforation, and opioid withdrawal with methylnaltrexone use.
* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Use caution in patients with liver or kidney problems; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Methylnaltrexone is a Category B drug in pregnancy. While animal studies haven't shown adverse effects,  it's unclear if it's excreted in breast milk. Due to the potential risk to the infant, breastfeeding is not recommended while using methylnaltrexone.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Methylnaltrexone may interact with other opioid antagonists (like naloxegol). Consult your doctor about any medications you're taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration.  Effects are usually seen within hours of injection. The effect of the oral formulation might take longer.
* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A:  Consult your doctor before stopping methylnaltrexone, as sudden cessation may lead to worsening constipation.
* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store methylnaltrexone according to the instructions on the label.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once. Contact your doctor if you have questions.
* **Q: Is it habit-forming?** A: No, methylnaltrexone is not considered habit-forming.
