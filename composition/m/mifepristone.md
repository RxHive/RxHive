# Mifepristone

**Generic Name:** Mifepristone

**Usage:** Mifepristone is used in combination with another medication, misoprostol, to induce a medical abortion.  It is used to end a pregnancy up to a certain gestational age (typically 10 weeks, but this varies by country and regulation).  It is also used off-label in other circumstances such as the treatment of certain types of uterine fibroids and Cushing's syndrome, though these are less common uses.  This information focuses primarily on its use for medical abortion.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Bleeding and cramping:** This is expected and often significant.  The bleeding is typically heavier than a normal menstrual period and may last for several days to weeks.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common and can be managed with over-the-counter medications.
* **Diarrhea:**  This is a less frequent but possible side effect.
* **Fever:** A mild fever is sometimes experienced.  High fever should be reported to a healthcare provider.
* **Headache:**  Mild to moderate headaches can occur.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired is a common side effect.
* **Dizziness:** Less frequent but possible.

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* **Incomplete abortion:** Requiring further medical intervention.
* **Infection:**  This requires immediate medical attention.
* **Heavy bleeding:** Requiring medical intervention to control the bleeding.
* **Allergic reaction:** Though rare, an allergic reaction to mifepristone is possible.


**How it Works:** Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist.  Progesterone is a hormone crucial for maintaining pregnancy. By blocking the action of progesterone, mifepristone prevents the continued growth and development of the pregnancy.  It does not directly expel the pregnancy tissue;  this is the role of misoprostol, which is taken later in the process. Misoprostol causes contractions of the uterus, leading to the expulsion of the pregnancy tissue.

**FAQs:**

* **Is mifepristone safe?**  Mifepristone is generally safe and effective when used as directed by a healthcare provider. However, like any medication, it carries potential risks and side effects.  The risk of complications is generally low, but varies depending on several factors including gestational age and the individual's health.
* **How effective is mifepristone?** When used in conjunction with misoprostol, mifepristone is highly effective in terminating a pregnancy, with success rates exceeding 95% in most studies.
* **What if I experience heavy bleeding or severe pain?**  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience heavy bleeding (soaking more than two pads an hour for several hours), severe pain, or other concerning symptoms.
* **Can I use mifepristone without a doctor's prescription?**  No. Mifepristone is a prescription medication and should only be used under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.  Improper use can lead to serious complications.
* **What are the long-term effects of mifepristone?**  Studies have not shown any significant long-term negative effects on fertility or future pregnancies for women who have used mifepristone for medical abortion.
* **Is mifepristone available everywhere?**  The availability of mifepristone varies significantly by country and region due to differing regulations and legal frameworks.
