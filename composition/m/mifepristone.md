# Mifepristone
### Generic Name
Mifepristone

### Usage

Mifepristone is primarily used in combination with misoprostol for medical termination of pregnancy up to 70 days of gestation.  It works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone crucial for maintaining pregnancy.  This ultimately leads to the breakdown of the uterine lining and expulsion of the pregnancy.

Secondary, less common use involves managing hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in adult patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome (a hormonal disorder causing excess cortisol). This application is limited to those with type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance, and only when surgery is unsuitable or has failed.  It's crucial to understand that mifepristone is *not* a treatment for type 2 diabetes in general; its use in this context is specifically targeted to Cushing syndrome-related hyperglycemia.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use:

**Termination of Intrauterine Pregnancy:**

* **Day 1:** 200 mg mifepristone orally, taken as a single dose under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
* **Day 2 or 3:** 800 mcg misoprostol (another medication) buccally (in the cheek pouch) 24-48 hours after mifepristone.  This is typically administered as four 200 mcg tablets.  The tablets should be held in place for 30 minutes, and any remnants swallowed with water.
* **Follow-up:** A follow-up appointment is crucial 7-14 days later to confirm complete expulsion of the pregnancy and assess bleeding.  If expulsion is incomplete but the pregnancy is not ongoing, additional misoprostol may be prescribed. Surgical intervention may be necessary for treatment failures.


**Hyperglycemia in Cushing Syndrome:**

* **Initial Dose:** 300 mg orally once daily.
* **Titration:** The dose may be increased by 300 mg increments at intervals of at least 2-4 weeks, depending on tolerability and symptom control.
* **Maximum Dose:** 1200 mg orally once daily, or up to 20 mg/kg/day, whichever is lower.
* **Interruption:** If treatment is interrupted, it should be restarted at 300 mg/day or a lower dose if the interruption was due to adverse reactions.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are needed for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Patients already on, or needing to start, strong CYP3A4 inhibitor therapy (certain medications impacting drug metabolism) also require careful dose adjustments as described in the full prescribing information.  These adjustments are crucial to avoid potentially harmful side effects or treatment failure.  Consult a physician for specific recommendations.


**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of mifepristone have not been established in children.

### How it Works

Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid that acts as a progesterone receptor antagonist.  In pregnancy termination, it blocks progesterone's action, leading to uterine contractions and the expulsion of the pregnancy.  In Cushing syndrome, at higher doses, it blocks cortisol's effects on glucose metabolism, helping to control blood sugar levels.  However, it also increases circulating cortisol levels.  The precise mechanisms are complex and involve interactions with various hormone receptors.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to mifepristone or misoprostol, concurrent use of certain medications (especially those metabolized by CYP3A4), pregnancy (except for its indicated use in termination), chronic adrenal failure, porphyrias, hemorrhagic disorders, concurrent anticoagulant therapy, presence of an IUD, ectopic pregnancy, undiagnosed adnexal masses, and long-term corticosteroid therapy for serious medical conditions.

* **Interactions:**  Mifepristone interacts with numerous medications, affecting both its efficacy and the levels of other drugs.  Concomitant use with certain drugs, including some statins, corticosteroids, and other medications metabolized through the CYP3A4 system, is contraindicated or requires careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments.  A complete list of drug interactions should be reviewed with a healthcare provider.

* **Warnings:**  Serious bacterial infections (potentially fatal) and excessive bleeding are rare but serious risks associated with mifepristone, particularly in the context of pregnancy termination. Patients should be aware of these potential complications and know when to seek immediate medical care.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Mifepristone is contraindicated during pregnancy (except for medically induced abortion). It's categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning the risk to the fetus outweighs any potential benefit.  It is excreted in breast milk, and appropriate precautions should be taken if breastfeeding is continued during treatment.

* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in women with severe anemia, hypercoagulability, or hemostatic disorders, and when using other QT-prolonging agents.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is mifepristone stored?** A:  Store mifepristone as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Can I take mifepristone with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to discuss all current medications, supplements, and herbal remedies with your doctor or pharmacist before taking mifepristone due to potential drug interactions.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose of mifepristone?** A:  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Missing a dose may impact efficacy and require adjustments to the treatment plan, especially in the case of Cushing's syndrome management.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A:  Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience severe side effects, such as severe abdominal pain, excessive bleeding, or signs of infection (fever, chills, etc.).

* **Q: Is mifepristone safe?** A:  Like all medications, mifepristone carries risks and potential side effects.  The benefits and risks should be carefully weighed by a healthcare provider.  Compliance with prescribed dosage and adherence to safety guidelines are essential.

* **Q: Can I buy mifepristone over-the-counter?** A:  No. Mifepristone is a prescription medication. It is available only through a restricted program and should be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
