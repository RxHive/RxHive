# Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
### Generic Name
Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine

### Usage

Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine is used for active immunization against invasive meningococcal disease.  This disease is caused by bacteria called *Neisseria meningitidis*. The vaccine protects against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 of this bacteria.  While it's primarily used as a preventative measure, it is *not* a treatment for existing meningococcal infections.  It's crucial to understand that this vaccine does *not* protect against serogroup B meningococcal disease.

### Dosage

**Adults (2 years and older):**  A single 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection is recommended.  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) prefers the MenACWY *conjugate* vaccine for adults over 56 who need only a single dose (e.g., travelers), but the polysaccharide vaccine remains an option.

**Children (2 years and older):**  The FDA approves this vaccine for children aged 2 years and older, with a single 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection. However, the ACIP guidelines do *not* currently recommend the polysaccharide vaccine for children.  The conjugate vaccine is preferred for children.  The vaccine is not recommended for children under 2 years old due to safety and efficacy concerns.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified in the manufacturer's labeling for individuals with renal or hepatic impairment.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients) may include:

* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Induration (hardening at the injection site)
* Malaise (general feeling of discomfort)
* Pain at the injection site
* Redness at the injection site
* Swelling at the injection site

Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of recipients) may include:

* Chills
* Fever
* Rash
* Vomiting

Serious, though less frequent, side effects such as anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) and syncope (fainting) are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if any serious adverse reaction occurs.


### How it Works

The Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine works by exposing the body's immune system to polysaccharides (sugars) found on the surface of the *Neisseria meningitidis* bacteria.  This triggers the production of antibodies that specifically target these polysaccharides.  If the individual is later exposed to the bacteria, these pre-formed antibodies can help neutralize the bacteria and prevent infection.  Unlike conjugate vaccines, it does not provide long-lasting immunity.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This vaccine should not be given to individuals with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine.
* **Warnings:** There is a risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions and syncope.  Close monitoring is advised for 15 minutes post-injection.
* **Use with Caution:** This vaccine should be used cautiously in severely immunocompromised individuals.  The effectiveness of the vaccine may be diminished in these populations.
* **Interactions:**  This vaccine may interact with certain medications such as immunosuppressants, belimumab, and fingolimod, potentially reducing its effectiveness. Consult a healthcare provider about any medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  This vaccine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The excretion in breast milk is unknown; use with caution during pregnancy and lactation.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection last?**  A: The protection offered by the polysaccharide vaccine is generally shorter-lived compared to conjugate vaccines.

* **Q: Can I get this vaccine if I'm sick?**  A:  It's generally recommended to postpone vaccination if you have a moderate or severe illness.  Mild illness is usually not a reason to delay vaccination.

* **Q: What should I do if I faint after the injection?**  A:  Lie down and elevate your legs.  This helps increase blood flow to the brain.  Seek medical attention if the fainting is prolonged or accompanied by other symptoms.

* **Q: Is this vaccine safe for everyone?**  A:  While generally safe, it's crucial to inform your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, or medications you're taking before receiving the vaccine.

* **Q:  Where can I get this vaccine?** A:  This vaccine is available from many healthcare providers, including doctors' offices, clinics, and pharmacies.  Check with your healthcare provider or local health department for availability.
