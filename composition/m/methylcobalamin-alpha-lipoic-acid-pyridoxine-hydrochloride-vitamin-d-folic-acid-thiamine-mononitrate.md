# Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Vitamin D + Folic Acid + Thiamine mononitrate

**Generic Name:** Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Vitamin D3 + Folic Acid + Thiamine Mononitrate (This is a combination product, so there isn't one single generic name.)

**Usage:**  This combination of nutrients is often used to support nerve health, energy production, and overall well-being.  Specific uses may include:

* **Nerve function:** Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) and alpha-lipoic acid are known to support nerve health and function, potentially beneficial in conditions like neuropathy.  Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) also plays a crucial role in nerve function.
* **Energy metabolism:**  All the components play a role in energy production within the body.  Thiamine (vitamin B1) is crucial for carbohydrate metabolism, while the other B vitamins (B6, B12) and alpha-lipoic acid are involved in various metabolic pathways.
* **Cognitive function:** Some studies suggest that these nutrients may support cognitive function, but more research is needed.
* **Overall health:** Vitamins D and folic acid are essential for various bodily functions, contributing to overall health and well-being.


**Side Effects:**  Generally, this combination is well-tolerated. However, side effects, though rare, can include:

* **Nausea:** Particularly with higher doses.
* **Vomiting:**  Particularly with higher doses.
* **Diarrhea:**  May occur with higher doses or individual sensitivities.
* **Allergic reactions:** Rare, but possible, especially with sensitivities to any of the individual components.
* **Changes in blood sugar:** Alpha-lipoic acid may affect blood sugar levels, so those with diabetes should monitor their levels closely.
* **Interactions with medications:**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you're taking, as interactions are possible.

**How it Works:**

This combination supplement works by providing the body with essential nutrients that play vital roles in various metabolic processes:

* **Methylcobalamin (B12):**  A crucial coenzyme involved in nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Alpha-Lipoic Acid:** A potent antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, and may improve nerve function.
* **Pyridoxine (B6):**  Essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, red blood cell formation, and immune function.
* **Vitamin D3:** Important for calcium absorption, immune function, and overall bone health.
* **Folic Acid (B9):**  Essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and cell growth.
* **Thiamine Mononitrate (B1):**  Essential for carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function.
