### How it Works

Miconazole is an antifungal medication that belongs to the imidazole class. It works by inhibiting the enzyme CYP450 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase, which is crucial for the production of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By disrupting ergosterol synthesis, miconazole alters the cell membrane's composition and permeability, leading to leakage of essential substances like cations, phosphates, and low molecular weight proteins. This ultimately leads to fungal cell death.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* **Tablet:** Hypersensitivity to miconazole, milk protein concentrate, or any component of the formulation.
* **Gel:** Hypersensitivity to miconazole, other imidazole derivatives, or any component of the formulation.  Also contraindicated in infants under 4 months old, infants lacking a developed swallowing reflex, and those with liver dysfunction.  Avoid concomitant use with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, including QTc-prolonging agents, ergot alkaloids, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, triazolam, and oral midazolam.

**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
* Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment and in pediatric patients.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Minimal systemic absorption occurs following buccal application. Topical treatment is generally preferred during pregnancy. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; weigh the risks and benefits before using this medication while breastfeeding.
