# Methisazone
### Generic Name
Methisazone (also known as Metisazone)

### Usage
Methisazone is an antiviral medication that was primarily used to prevent the spread of smallpox.  It worked by interfering with the virus's ability to replicate.  Given that smallpox has been eradicated globally, methisazone is no longer used clinically and is not commercially available.  Any information provided here is for historical and educational purposes only.

### Dosage
Because methisazone is no longer used, specific dosage information is unavailable through current clinical channels.  Historical data indicates that dosages varied depending on the individual and the specific situation, but precise details are not readily accessible and should not be relied upon for any treatment purpose.

### Side Effects
While methisazone was generally considered relatively safe, reported side effects included:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Rash
* Jaundice (in rare cases)

More serious side effects were infrequent but included liver damage.  It's crucial to remember that this information is for historical reference only, and no medical advice should be derived from it.

### How it Works
Methisazone functioned as an antiviral by inhibiting the synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins.  By blocking these crucial steps in the smallpox virus's replication cycle, it prevented the virus from producing infectious particles.  This mechanism of action is specific to certain viruses, particularly poxviruses like smallpox.

### Precautions
Given the discontinuation of methisazone, detailed precautions are not readily available through standard medical channels.  Historical data may suggest some precautions, but these are unreliable for modern application.  Any information should not be used for self-treatment or medical guidance.
