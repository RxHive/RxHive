# Mobocertinib
### Generic Name
Mobocertinib

### Usage
Mobocertinib is a targeted therapy used to treat locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Specifically, it's indicated for adult patients whose cancer has an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutation, as confirmed by an FDA-approved test, and whose disease has progressed after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.  This means the cancer has spread and hasn't responded well to previous standard treatments.  Currently, there are no approved uses for Mobocertinib outside of this specific NSCLC indication.

### Dosage

The typical adult dose of Mobocertinib is 160 mg once daily (OD) by mouth, continued until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects develop.  There is no established safe and effective dose for children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  For mild to moderate hepatic impairment (liver problems), no dose adjustment is needed.  For severe hepatic impairment, the manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments.  Close monitoring is crucial.

* **Renal Impairment:**  For patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or higher, no dose adjustment is necessary.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer adjustments for eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m².  Careful monitoring is recommended.

* **Toxicity Management:**  The dose may be reduced (120 mg OD then 80 mg OD) to manage side effects like QTc prolongation (heart rhythm issues), decreased ejection fraction (heart function), interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis (lung inflammation), or diarrhea.  In some cases, Mobocertinib may need to be withheld or permanently discontinued depending on the severity and type of side effect.  Consult the prescribing information for detailed guidance.

* **Coadministration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors:**  Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors with Mobocertinib should be avoided. If unavoidable, reduce the Mobocertinib dose by approximately 50% and monitor the QTc interval more frequently. After discontinuing the inhibitor, resume the previous Mobocertinib dose after sufficient time has elapsed (3 to 5 elimination half-lives).

### How it Works

Mobocertinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).  It works by specifically targeting and blocking the activity of the EGFR protein, particularly those with exon 20 insertion mutations.  These mutations drive the growth of certain types of lung cancer cells. By inhibiting EGFR, Mobocertinib interferes with the signals that tell cancer cells to grow and divide, ultimately slowing or stopping cancer progression. Mobocertinib also inhibits HER2 and HER4 (EGFR family members) and B-lymphocyte kinase (BLK) at clinically relevant concentrations.


### Precautions

* **QTc Prolongation:** Mobocertinib can cause a life-threatening lengthening of the QTc interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG), leading to potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities.  Regular ECG monitoring is essential.  Avoid concomitant use of other QTc-prolonging drugs.

* **Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis:** Mobocertinib can cause lung inflammation.  Monitor for symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and fever.

* **Cardiac Toxicity:**  Mobocertinib may affect heart function, leading to decreased ejection fraction and heart failure.  Regular monitoring of cardiac function is crucial.

* **Diarrhea:**  Diarrhea is a common side effect that can be severe.  Prompt management is important.

* **Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:** Mobocertinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for one month after the last dose.  Men should also use contraception during treatment and for one week afterward.

* **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be needed, or close monitoring is required for patients with liver or kidney problems.

* **Drug Interactions:** Mobocertinib can interact with other medications, especially those metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme system (e.g., strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers). Discuss all medications with your doctor.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Mobocertinib with food?**  A: Yes, Mobocertinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose by more than 6 hours, skip the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled.

* **Q: How should I store Mobocertinib?** A: Store Mobocertinib according to the instructions provided on the label.  Typically, it should be kept at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I drink grapefruit juice while taking Mobocertinib?** A: No, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they can affect how your body processes Mobocertinib.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  Some side effects require immediate medical attention.

* **Q: Is Mobocertinib safe for pregnant women?** A: No, Mobocertinib can cause harm to a developing fetus.  It is contraindicated in pregnancy.
