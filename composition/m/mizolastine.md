# Mizolastine
### Generic Name
Mizolastine

### Usage
Mizolastine is a long-acting antihistamine primarily used for the symptomatic relief of allergic conditions.  Its main uses include:

*   **Seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (hay fever):**  This is an allergic reaction to pollen in the air, causing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion.
*   **Perennial allergic rhinoconjunctivitis:** This is a year-round allergic reaction to things like dust mites, pet dander, or mold, producing similar symptoms to seasonal hay fever.
*   **Urticaria (hives):**  This is a skin condition characterized by itchy, raised welts.

Mizolastine helps alleviate the symptoms of these conditions but doesn't cure the underlying allergy.


### Dosage

**Adults (including adolescents aged 12 years and older):** The usual dose is one 10mg tablet once daily, orally.


**Children under 12 years:** Mizolastine is not typically recommended for children under 12 years old.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment:**  Mizolastine should be used with extreme caution in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment. It's contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) in patients with severe liver impairment.
*   **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with kidney problems, but caution is advised.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects:** These may include nausea, headache, dizziness, transient drowsiness, anxiety, depression, dry mouth (xerostomia), diarrhea, abdominal pain, increased appetite with associated weight gain.

**Less common but serious side effects:**  These are rare but can be serious and include raised liver enzymes, low neutrophil count (a type of white blood cell), transient weakness (asthenia), low blood pressure (hypotension), rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), palpitations, fainting (vasovagal attack), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), allergic reactions (including potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis).

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Mizolastine is an H1-antihistamine.  Histamine is a substance released by the body during allergic reactions, causing many of the symptoms. Mizolastine works by selectively blocking histamine's effects at the peripheral H1 receptors, preventing these symptoms from developing or lessening their severity.  It also shows promise in inhibiting histamine release from mast cells (immune cells involved in allergic responses) and reducing neutrophil migration in animal studies, suggesting additional anti-allergic mechanisms.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Mizolastine should not be used by people with a known allergy to mizolastine or any ingredients in the formulation, severe liver impairment, cardiac diseases (bradycardia, arrhythmias, or QT prolongation), or electrolyte imbalances (especially low potassium).  It must not be used concurrently with macrolide antibiotics, systemic imidazole antifungals, or class I and III antiarrhythmics.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Mizolastine can interact with other medications, especially antidepressants, anxiolytics (anti-anxiety medications), cimetidine, ciclosporin, nifedipine, macrolide antibiotics, and imidazole antifungals.  These interactions can either increase the sedative effects or alter mizolastine's metabolism, potentially leading to adverse effects.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of mizolastine during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  It's generally advised to avoid use during pregnancy, especially the first trimester, and breastfeeding.  Consult your doctor for guidance.
*   **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Mizolastine may cause drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you.
*   **Hepatic and Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate liver problems. No specific dosage adjustment is given for kidney problems, but caution is necessary.
