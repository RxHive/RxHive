# Methylergonovine
### Generic Name
Methylergonovine

### Usage
Methylergonovine, also known as methylergometrine, is primarily used to control postpartum hemorrhage (bleeding after childbirth) caused by uterine atony (weakness of the uterine muscles).  It achieves this by stimulating the uterus to contract more forcefully, reducing blood loss.  It's also used to manage uterine hemorrhage following delivery of the anterior shoulder during labor and to treat subinvolution of the uterus (failure of the uterus to return to its normal size after delivery).  While not its primary indication, methylergonovine has also been used off-label to treat refractory cluster headaches (severe, recurring headaches that don't respond to other treatments).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Postpartum Hemorrhage:**
    * **Oral:** 0.2 mg three or four times daily (TID or QID) for up to one week postpartum.
    * **Intramuscular (IM):** 0.2 mg after delivery of the anterior shoulder, after placental delivery, or during the postpartum period.  The dose may be repeated every 2-4 hours as needed.
    * **Intravenous (IV):** 0.2 mg administered slowly over at least 60 seconds. IV administration is reserved for life-threatening situations only due to the risk of severe side effects.

* **Refractory Cluster Headache (off-label):** 0.2 mg three or four times daily (TID or QID), but treatment shouldn't exceed six months.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and effectiveness of methylergonovine in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is advised in these populations.


### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
* Palpitations
* Transient chest pain
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein)
* Hematuria (blood in the urine)
* Water intoxication
* Hallucinations
* Leg cramps
* Nasal congestion
* Diarrhea
* Foul taste
* Allergic reactions (including shock)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)


Less common, but more serious side effects, may occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.


### How it Works

Methylergonovine is an ergot alkaloid that directly affects the smooth muscles of the uterus. It increases the tone, rate, and strength of uterine contractions, leading to a sustained, powerful contraction that helps to reduce or stop postpartum bleeding.  This action is crucial in controlling bleeding after childbirth.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Methylergonovine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to methylergonovine or any of its components
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Pregnancy (use is only after delivery)
* Toxemia (severe pregnancy-related hypertension)

**Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with:

* Coronary artery disease (due to increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischemia)
* Hepatic impairment
* Renal impairment
* Sepsis (severe bloodstream infection)
* Obliterative vascular disease
* Second stage of labor


**Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with potent or less potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (certain antifungal, antibiotic, and anti-HIV medications) may increase methylergonovine levels and the risk of severe vasoconstriction.  Consult a doctor before combining methylergonovine with other medications.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Methylergonovine is contraindicated during pregnancy. It is excreted in breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding should be avoided for at least 12 hours after the last dose.
