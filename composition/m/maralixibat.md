# Maralixibat
### Generic Name
Maralixibat

### Usage
Maralixibat is primarily used to treat cholestatic pruritus (severe itching) in patients aged 1 year and older with Alagille syndrome (ALGS).  ALGS is a rare genetic disorder affecting the liver and other organs, leading to bile duct abnormalities and buildup of bile acids in the body, causing intense itching.  Currently, this is its only approved use.

### Dosage

**Cholestatic pruritus due to Alagille syndrome:**

* **Oral Solution (9.5 mg/mL):**  The initial dose for both adults and children is 0.19 mg/kg/day (maximum 14.25 mg/day) given once daily for 7 days.  After this initial period, the dose is increased to a target dose of 0.38 mg/kg/day (maximum 28.5 mg/day) once daily.  The maximum daily dose is 28.5 mg regardless of age or weight.

* **Administration:**  The oral solution should be administered 30 minutes before the first meal of the day. The patient should be seated upright or standing and remain upright for a few minutes after taking the medication.  Use a calibrated oral dosing syringe; do not use a household teaspoon.

* **Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are specified for renal impairment.  For hepatic impairment (liver problems), adjustments depend on the severity.  New-onset liver test abnormalities warrant temporary discontinuation, while hepatic decompensation (e.g., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) or portal hypertension requires permanent discontinuation.  Persistent diarrhea, vomiting, or dehydration may necessitate dose reduction or discontinuation.  Monitor for and manage fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K).

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Increased INR (a measure of blood clotting time)
* Increased levels of ALT and AST (liver enzymes)
* Vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (bleeding in the gut)
* Nausea
* Increased bilirubin levels (indicating liver dysfunction)
* Bone fracture

**Important Note:**  If you experience any of these side effects, particularly severe or persistent ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Maralixibat is an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor.  IBAT is a protein in the intestines responsible for reabsorbing bile acids. By blocking IBAT, maralixibat prevents the reabsorption of bile acids, reducing their levels in the bloodstream.  While the exact mechanism for improving pruritus isn't fully understood, lowering the circulating bile acid levels is thought to be a key factor in alleviating the itching associated with ALGS.

### Precautions

* **Drug Interactions:** Bile acid-binding resins (like cholestyramine, colesevelam, or colestipol) should be administered at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after maralixibat to avoid interactions.
* **Liver Function:**  Close monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is crucial, especially during initiation and dose adjustments.
* **Vitamin Deficiencies:**  Maralixibat can lead to fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies; supplementation may be necessary.  Regular monitoring of vitamin levels is recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While potential fetal and infant exposure is expected to be low due to low systemic absorption, healthcare providers should carefully weigh the benefits and risks.  Supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins may be necessary during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Gastrointestinal Effects:** Monitor for diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting.  These side effects may require dose adjustments or discontinuation of the medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store maralixibat?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the medication label.  Typically, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If less than 12 hours have passed since the scheduled time, take the missed dose as soon as possible. If more than 12 hours have passed, skip the missed dose and resume the regular dosing schedule.

* **Q: Can I take maralixibat with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Some medications may interact with maralixibat.

* **Q:  Is maralixibat safe for children?** A: Maralixibat is approved for children aged 1 year and older with ALGS, but careful monitoring is crucial due to the potential for side effects.

* **Q:  How long will I need to take maralixibat?** A: The duration of treatment depends on individual response and your doctor's recommendations.
