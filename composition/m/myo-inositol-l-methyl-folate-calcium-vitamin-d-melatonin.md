**Generic Name:** Myo-Inositol + L-Methylfolate Calcium + Vitamin D3 + Melatonin

**Usage:** This combination supplement is often used to address various health concerns, primarily related to women's health, mood, and sleep.  It's not a treatment for any specific disease, but rather a support supplement. The specific usage may vary depending on individual needs and should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  Common uses might include:

* **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):**  Myo-inositol and L-methylfolate are often used to improve insulin sensitivity and ovulation in women with PCOS.
* **Depression and anxiety:** Myo-inositol and L-methylfolate play a role in neurotransmitter function, potentially offering some mood support.
* **Sleep improvement:** Melatonin is a well-known sleep aid.
* **Immune support:** Vitamin D contributes to immune function.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and infrequent, but can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, bloating, diarrhea, or constipation.
* **Headache:**  Potentially from any of the components.
* **Sleepiness (daytime):**  Especially with higher doses of melatonin.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible, especially with sensitivity to any of the ingredients.
* **Increased risk of bleeding (with higher doses of folate):** Individuals taking anticoagulant medications should consult their doctor before using this supplement.

Note:  The severity and likelihood of side effects depend on the dosage and individual sensitivity.


**How it Works:** Each component contributes to the overall effects:

* **Myo-Inositol:** A type of sugar alcohol that plays a role in insulin signaling and cell function. It may improve insulin sensitivity and potentially help with PCOS symptoms. It might also influence neurotransmitter function.

* **L-Methylfolate Calcium:** The active form of folate (vitamin B9), which is easily absorbed and utilized by the body. It's crucial for neurotransmitter production and DNA synthesis. Its use in PCOS is linked to improved insulin sensitivity and ovulation.

* **Vitamin D3:** Plays a critical role in calcium absorption, bone health, and immune function.  It's also being studied for its potential influence on mood and other health parameters.

* **Melatonin:** A hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. It helps to promote sleep onset and improve sleep quality.
