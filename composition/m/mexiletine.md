# Mexiletine

**Generic Name:** Mexiletine

**Usage:**

Mexiletine is a class I antiarrhythmic drug primarily used to treat chronic stable ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats originating in the ventricles) in patients with documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.  It's specifically indicated for those who haven't responded adequately to other treatments. It's less commonly used now due to the availability of newer antiarrhythmic drugs with potentially better side effect profiles.  Use is typically reserved for situations where other medications have failed.

**Side Effects:**

Mexiletine has a wide range of potential side effects, which can vary in severity.  These include:

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, tremor, headache, weakness, and fatigue.
* **Serious Side Effects:**  Rare but serious side effects include heart block (slowed heart rate), seizures, agranulocytosis (low white blood cell count increasing infection risk), and liver damage.  Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing) are also possible.
* **Neurological Side Effects:**  These are particularly noteworthy and can include ataxia (loss of coordination), nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), and paresthesia (numbness or tingling).

It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.

**How it Works:**

Mexiletine is a sodium channel blocker. This means it works by slowing down the movement of sodium ions into the heart muscle cells. This effect reduces the excitability of the heart muscle, thereby stabilizing the heart rhythm and preventing or reducing the frequency of dangerous arrhythmias.  Specifically, it blocks sodium channels in the Purkinje fibers and ventricular myocardium, thus affecting conduction velocity and refractoriness.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is Mexiletine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Mexiletine should be used with extreme caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed by a doctor.  It's generally avoided if possible in these situations.

* **Q: Can Mexiletine be taken with other medications?** A: Yes, but there are potential drug interactions.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to avoid potentially dangerous interactions.

* **Q: How long does it take for Mexiletine to work?** A: The time it takes to see a therapeutic effect can vary.  It may take several days or weeks to achieve optimal therapeutic levels and control arrhythmias.

* **Q: What are the signs of an overdose?** A: Signs of Mexiletine overdose include severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, seizures, and decreased heart rate. Immediate medical attention is crucial in case of overdose.

* **Q:  Why is Mexiletine less commonly prescribed now?** A: Newer antiarrhythmic drugs often have better side effect profiles and broader efficacy, making them preferred choices in many cases.  Mexiletine's use is generally reserved for situations where other treatments have failed.
