# Methylene Blue
### Generic Name
Methylene Blue

### Usage

Methylene blue, also known as methylthioninium chloride, is primarily used to treat acquired methemoglobinemia in both adults and children. Methemoglobinemia is a condition where the iron in hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells, is in an oxidized state (methemoglobin), rendering it unable to effectively bind and transport oxygen. This leads to a deficiency of oxygen in the body's tissues.  Acquired methemoglobinemia can be caused by various factors, including exposure to certain drugs or toxins.

Beyond its primary use, methylene blue has several off-label applications, though these uses require careful consideration and monitoring by a healthcare professional. These include:

* **Ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy:**  Methylene blue may be used to treat or prevent encephalopathy (brain dysfunction) associated with the chemotherapy drug ifosfamide.
* **Sentinel node mapping in breast cancer surgery:** It's used as a dye to help identify lymph nodes during surgery.
* **Onychomycosis treatment:**  Used topically, sometimes in conjunction with photodynamic therapy, to treat onychomycosis (fungal nail infection).
* **Chromoendoscopy:**  Used as a dye to improve visualization during endoscopy procedures of the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Treatment of vasoplegic syndrome:**  Used to treat severe low blood pressure associated with cardiac surgery or certain drug overdoses.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (IV, oral, topical, intraparenchymal), and the patient's age and weight.  **It is crucial to follow a healthcare professional's precise instructions.**  The information below is for general understanding only and should not be considered a prescription.

**Adult Dosage (Acquired Methemoglobinemia):**  The typical IV dose is 1-2 mg/kg administered over 5-30 minutes. This dose may be repeated after an hour if needed, but exceeding two doses carries risks.

**Pediatric Dosage (Acquired Methemoglobinemia):**  For infants, children, and adolescents, the typical IV or intraosseous dose is 1-2 mg/kg, which may be repeated every 30-60 minutes if necessary.


**Dosage for Other Uses:** Dosages for the off-label uses mentioned above vary significantly and are not standardized.  Healthcare professionals will determine the appropriate dose based on individual patient factors and the specific clinical situation.  Examples include 50mg oral or IV doses for ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, and 5ml of a 1% solution injected during breast cancer surgery for sentinel node mapping.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with kidney or liver impairment.  Always consult with a doctor for guidance.


### Side Effects

Methylene blue can cause a range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity.  

**Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Feeling hot
* Headache
* Nausea
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Skin discoloration (temporary blue-tinged skin and urine)
* Limb pain

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Methemoglobinemia (paradoxical worsening of the condition being treatedâ€”a serious risk with high doses, especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency)
* Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells)
* Serotonin syndrome (potentially life-threatening reaction, especially when combined with other serotonergic drugs)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Confusion
* Seizures

**If any adverse effects occur, particularly serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works

Methylene blue works primarily by reducing methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.  Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin that cannot carry oxygen effectively. Methylene blue facilitates the reduction of methemoglobin, allowing for improved oxygen transport throughout the body. It achieves this by acting as an electron carrier, participating in a redox reaction that converts methemoglobin back to its functional form.  In the case of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, the exact mechanism is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methylene blue is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to methylene blue or other thiazine dyes, pregnancy, and individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Generic formulations also list contraindications for use during pregnancy or by women who are or may become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Methylene blue can interact with certain medications, particularly serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAO inhibitors), potentially leading to serotonin syndrome.  Concomitant use should be avoided unless strictly necessary under close medical supervision.  Discontinuation of the serotonergic drug is often recommended before, during, or after methylene blue administration.
* **Warnings:**  Extravasation (leakage from an IV line) can cause tissue damage.   Methylene blue can temporarily stain skin and urine blue.  Close monitoring is needed for patients with liver or kidney problems.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Methylene blue is categorized as pregnancy category X (contraindicated during pregnancy). Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; healthcare providers may recommend stopping breastfeeding during and after treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for methylene blue to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration.  For methemoglobinemia, improvements in oxygen levels are usually seen relatively quickly.

* **Q: How is methylene blue stored?** A:  Storage conditions vary depending on the specific formulation. Always refer to the product label for precise storage instructions.

* **Q: Is methylene blue safe?** A: Methylene blue is generally safe when used appropriately and under medical supervision. However, it carries risks of side effects, especially at high doses or when interacting with other medications.

* **Q: Can I take methylene blue without a prescription?** A: No. Methylene blue should only be administered under the direction of a healthcare professional due to its potential side effects and interactions.  Self-medication can be dangerous.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.
