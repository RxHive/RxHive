It's important to note that this combination is a symptomatic treatment; it addresses the symptoms of pain and fever but does not cure the underlying cause.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for the underlying condition causing the pain or fever.

### How it Works

Mefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) reduces fever and provides pain relief through a mechanism that is not fully understood but is thought to involve affecting the way the body processes pain signals in the central nervous system.  The combination provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.
