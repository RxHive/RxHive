# Mebendazole
### Generic Name
Mebendazole

### Usage
Mebendazole is an anthelmintic medication, meaning it's used to treat parasitic worm infestations (helminthiasis) in the gastrointestinal tract.  Its primary use is for treating infections caused by several types of worms, including:

*   **Hookworms:** *Ancylostoma duodenale* and *Necator americanus*
*   **Roundworms:** *Ascaris lumbricoides*
*   **Pinworms:** *Enterobius vermicularis*
*   **Whipworms:** *Trichuris trichiura*

While these are its primary targets, mebendazole is also sometimes used off-label (meaning not officially approved for this purpose) to treat other parasitic infections such as *Giardia duodenalis* (giardiasis), *Mansonella perstans* (filariasis), toxocariasis (visceral larva migrans), *Ancylostoma caninum*, *Capillaria philippinensis* (capillariasis), cystic echinococcosis, trichinellosis (*Trichinella spiralis*), and trichostrongyliasis.  The effectiveness and safety in these off-label uses may vary.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the type of infection, the patient's age, and the specific formulation of the medication (typically tablets or suspensions).  The information below is for guidance only and should not be substituted for a doctor's prescription.  

**Adults:**

Dosage varies widely depending on the specific parasite being treated. For example:

* **Pinworm (Enterobiasis):**  A single 100mg dose, repeated after two weeks.
* **Roundworm (Ascariasis), Hookworm:** 100mg twice daily for three days, or a single 500mg dose.  A repeat dose may be necessary after three weeks if the infection persists.
* **Whipworm (Trichuriasis):** 100mg twice daily for three days, with a possible repeat dose after three weeks.
* Off-label uses (giardiasis, filariasis, etc.): Doses vary substantially and require specific guidance from a physician.  These often involve higher doses and longer treatment durations.


**Children:**

Dosage for children also depends on the infection and their weight and age.  Generally, the same infections are treated with similar regimens (though often at lower doses)  as in adults, but many off-label uses are not recommended for children due to a lack of safety and efficacy data. Always consult a pediatrician before administering mebendazole to a child.  Treatment for pinworms in children over 2 years old is similar to adults.

**Important Note:**  The information above is a summary.  Precise dosing instructions must come from a healthcare provider who can assess the individual patient's needs and choose the appropriate regimen.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and include:

*   Abdominal pain
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Flatulence (gas)
*   Anorexia (loss of appetite)

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

*   Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
*   Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
*   Bone marrow suppression (rare, usually with high doses and long-term use)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as less common,  seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Mebendazole works by interfering with the tubulin formation in the parasitic worms.  Tubulin is a protein essential for the structure and function of the worm's cells, particularly its gut. By disrupting tubulin, mebendazole impairs the worm's ability to absorb glucose and nutrients, leading to its paralysis, reduced egg production, and eventual death.  The dead worms are then passed out of the body naturally.


### Precautions

*   **Allergy:** Do not use mebendazole if you are allergic to it or any of its ingredients.
*   **Liver and Kidney Problems:** Use with caution if you have liver or kidney disease. Your doctor may need to adjust the dosage or monitor your condition closely.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Mebendazole is classified as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on the fetus are not fully known.  Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before use during pregnancy. It's excreted in breast milk, but generally considered compatible with breastfeeding.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Mebendazole can interact with certain medications like carbamazepine, phenytoin, and cimetidine. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
*   **Children:** Use with caution in children and follow the dosage instructions precisely as prescribed by a pediatrician.

### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take for mebendazole to work?**  A: You may not notice immediate effects, but the parasites should start to die within a few days of starting treatment.  Follow-up stool tests are often recommended to ensure the infection has been cleared.

*   **Q: How should I store mebendazole?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

*   **Q: Can I take mebendazole with food?** A:  Mebendazole tablets can be chewed, swallowed whole, or crushed and mixed with food.

*   **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.  Contact your doctor if you have concerns about missed doses.

*   **Q: Is mebendazole safe for long-term use?** A:  Generally, mebendazole isn't intended for long-term use except in very specific circumstances, like cystic echinococcosis. Prolonged use can increase the risk of side effects.  Your physician will determine the appropriate treatment duration.
