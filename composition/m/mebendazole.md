# Mebendazole

**Generic Name:** Mebendazole

**Usage:** Mebendazole is an antihelminthic medication, meaning it's used to treat infections caused by parasitic worms (helminths).  It's effective against a wide range of intestinal worms, including:

* **Roundworms (nematodes):**  *Ascaris lumbricoides*, *Enterobius vermicularis* (pinworms), *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworms), *Necator americanus* (hookworms), *Ancylostoma duodenale* (hookworms)
* **Whipworms (Trichuriasis):** *Trichuris trichiura*
* **Pinworms (Enterobiasis):** *Enterobius vermicularis*
* **Hookworms:** *Necator americanus*, *Ancylostoma duodenale*
* **Certain tapeworms (cestodes):**  *Taenia spp.* (tapeworms), although other medications are often preferred for tapeworm infections.

The specific dosage and duration of treatment will vary depending on the type of infection and the patient's age and health.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's instructions precisely.

**Side Effects:** Mebendazole is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These are usually mild and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* **Headache**
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives (rare but serious)
* **Hair loss** (rare)
* **Liver problems** (rare, usually only with high doses or long-term use)


**How it Works:** Mebendazole interferes with the ability of parasitic worms to absorb glucose, a crucial sugar for their metabolism and survival. This glucose deprivation ultimately leads to the death and expulsion of the worms from the body.  It works primarily by inhibiting the function of microtubules, which are essential components of the worm's cells.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is mebendazole safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A:  The use of mebendazole during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult a doctor before taking it during these periods.  Some sources advise avoiding use during pregnancy.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The effects of mebendazole are usually seen within a few days to a few weeks, but the complete elimination of the worms might take longer.  Symptoms may improve before the worms are completely eliminated.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I buy mebendazole over-the-counter?** A:  In some countries, mebendazole may be available over-the-counter for certain specific worm infections (like pinworms). However, for other infections or if you are unsure about the diagnosis, it's essential to consult a doctor for a proper diagnosis and prescription.

* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions?** A: Mebendazole may interact with certain medications.  It's important to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A: If you experience severe or persistent side effects, such as severe abdominal pain, allergic reactions, or liver problems, stop taking mebendazole and seek immediate medical attention.
