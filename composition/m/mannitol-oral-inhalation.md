# Mannitol (Oral Inhalation)
### Generic Name
Mannitol (Oral Inhalation)

### Usage
Mannitol, in oral inhalation form, is primarily used as a diagnostic agent.  Its main application is in assessing bronchial hyperresponsiveness, a key indicator of airway reactivity, particularly in children aged 6 years and older who don't show clear signs of asthma. This test helps determine the likelihood of asthma or other airway diseases.  While not a primary treatment, it plays a crucial role in diagnosis and guiding further management.  It is also used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

### Dosage

**Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness Assessment (Adults and Children ≥ 6 years):**

Mannitol is administered via a stepwise inhalation procedure using a kit with multiple doses.  The test continues until a positive response (15% decrease in FEV1 from baseline or 10% decrease between consecutive doses) is observed or the total dose of 635 mg is reached. The specific dosage steps are detailed in the product information.  The test must be administered and interpreted by healthcare professionals trained in performing bronchial challenge tests.

**Cystic Fibrosis (Adults and Children ≥ 6 years):**

* **Initial Dose Assessment:**  A stepwise inhalation process is used, beginning with a 40 mg dose and escalating to 80 mg, 120 mg, and 160 mg, with FEV1 and SpO2 monitoring after each step.  A bronchodilator should be given 5-15 minutes before each dose.
* **Maintenance Dosing:**  Once the initial assessment is complete, a typical maintenance dose is 400 mg twice daily (BID), given in the morning and evening (2-3 hours before bedtime).

**Important Note:** The specific dosage steps and monitoring parameters for both uses must be carefully followed as outlined by healthcare providers and the product information.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment are not specified in the manufacturer’s labeling.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Chest discomfort
* Nausea
* Throat irritation
* Retching
* Cough
* Pharyngolaryngeal pain
* Rhinorrhea (runny nose)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Wheezing

**Less Common/Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing, and/or case reports):**

* Decreased FEV1
* Gagging

**Important:**  Any adverse effects, especially severe bronchospasm, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Mannitol, a sugar alcohol, acts as a bronchoconstrictor when inhaled.  The precise mechanism isn't fully understood but it triggers constriction of the airways, which is measured to assess bronchial hyperresponsiveness.  In the context of cystic fibrosis, the mechanism of therapeutic benefit is not fully elucidated.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Mannitol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to mannitol, gelatin, or any formulation component, and those with conditions that could be worsened by induced bronchospasm or repeated spirometry (e.g., aortic or cerebral aneurysm, uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident).
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of significant hemoptysis (coughing up blood).
* **Boxed Warning (Severe Bronchospasm):**  Mannitol can cause severe bronchospasm.  Bronchial challenge testing should only be performed by trained professionals with equipment and medication to treat severe bronchospasm readily available. It should not be used in patients with clinically apparent asthma or very low baseline pulmonary function.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Mannitol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, thus caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Mannitol administered?** A: Mannitol for bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing is administered via a specific inhaler device, following a stepwise protocol. For cystic fibrosis, capsules are loaded into an inhaler device and inhaled.


* **Q: How is the test interpreted?** A:  A positive test for bronchial hyperresponsiveness indicates increased airway reactivity. A healthcare professional interprets the results based on changes in FEV1.


* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially severe ones like bronchospasm, immediately to your healthcare provider.


* **Q: How should Mannitol be stored?** A:  Refer to the product packaging for specific storage instructions.


* **Q: Is Mannitol a cure for asthma or cystic fibrosis?** A: No, Mannitol is a diagnostic tool for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and a treatment for cystic fibrosis; it doesn't cure these conditions.  It aids in diagnosis and disease management.
