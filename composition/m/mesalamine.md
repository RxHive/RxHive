# Mesalamine
### Generic Name
Mesalamine

### Usage

Mesalamine is a medication primarily used to treat and prevent mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting the large intestine.  It works by reducing inflammation in the colon.  While its main use is in ulcerative colitis, mesalamine may also be used off-label in some cases of Crohn's disease, another IBD, particularly for post-resection management (managing the disease after surgical removal of part of the bowel) and in cases of mild to moderate disease.  The specific form of mesalamine (oral, rectal suppository, enema, or foam) will depend on the location and severity of the inflammation.

### Dosage

Mesalamine dosage varies greatly depending on the specific formulation (oral capsules, tablets, granules, rectal suppositories, enemas, or foam), the indication (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), the severity of the disease, the patient's age and weight, and whether it's for induction of remission or maintenance therapy.  Dosage information should always be obtained from the prescribing physician and the specific product labeling.  The examples below are not exhaustive and should not substitute for consultation with a medical professional.

**Adults:**

* **Ulcerative Colitis (Induction of Remission):** Oral doses generally range from 2.4 to 4.8 grams per day, divided into multiple doses.  Rectal formulations (suppositories or enemas) may be used, with doses varying according to the product. Treatment duration typically lasts 6-8 weeks.

* **Ulcerative Colitis (Maintenance of Remission):** Oral doses typically range from 1.5 to 4 grams per day. Rectal formulations can also be utilized for maintenance, with dosages varying by product.

* **Crohn's Disease:**  Dosage and duration of treatment are highly variable and determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician.

**Children:**

Dosage for children with ulcerative colitis is weight-based and is significantly lower than adult doses.  Specific dosages must be determined by a pediatrician or gastroenterologist and are determined according to the child's weight and the specific formulation used.

**Important Note:**  The information above provides general ranges.  Precise dosage instructions must come from a healthcare provider and the medication packaging insert.

### How it Works

Mesalamine, also known as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), is believed to work by reducing inflammation in the digestive tract.  Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it's thought to interfere with the production of substances that contribute to inflammation. It's important to note that mesalamine primarily acts locally within the intestines, minimizing systemic (whole-body) effects.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Mesalamine should not be used by individuals with known allergies to mesalamine, salicylates (like aspirin), or any of the drug's components.

* **Kidney and Liver Disease:**  Individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver problems should use mesalamine with caution and under close medical supervision, as the drug can further impair these organs.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While mesalamine may be used during pregnancy if necessary, its use should be closely monitored. It's important to discuss the risks and benefits with a doctor. Mesalamine is excreted in breast milk, so the benefits and risks should be carefully weighed for breastfeeding mothers.

* **Interactions:** Mesalamine can interact with certain medications, like digoxin.  Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Acute Intolerance Syndrome:** This is a rare but serious complication.  Symptoms include severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and fever.  Seek medical attention immediately if these occur.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for mesalamine to work?** A:  The onset of action varies; some individuals may notice improvements within a few weeks, while others might require several months of treatment.

* **Q: Can I stop taking mesalamine suddenly?** A: No, stopping mesalamine abruptly could lead to a flare-up of symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: How should I store mesalamine?** A:  Store mesalamine as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.
