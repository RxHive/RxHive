# Mycophenolate mofetil
### Generic Name
Mycophenolate mofetil

### Usage

Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressant medication primarily used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. This means it helps the body accept a transplanted organ, such as a kidney, heart, liver, or lung, by suppressing the immune system's response that would otherwise attack the foreign tissue.  It's crucial in preventing the body from rejecting the transplanted organ, thereby increasing the chances of successful transplantation.

Beyond transplantation, mycophenolate mofetil also finds use in treating certain autoimmune diseases.  While not as common as its role in transplantation, it can be prescribed for conditions like lupus nephritis (kidney inflammation due to lupus) and severe rheumatoid arthritis, although other medications are often preferred as first-line treatments in these cases.  The use in autoimmune diseases is generally reserved for severe cases where other treatments haven't been successful.


### Dosage

Dosage of mycophenolate mofetil varies significantly depending on the individual's condition, weight, age, and the specific organ transplanted.  It's *crucially important* to follow the physician's precise instructions. There is no standardized dosage across all cases.  The following information is for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.  **Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for the correct dosage.**


* **Oral (Tablet/Capsule):**  Dosages typically range from 1 gram to 3 grams per day, often divided into two doses.  Specific daily dosages depend on the indication (organ transplant or autoimmune disease) and the patient's overall health profile.

* **Intravenous (IV):** IV administration is usually employed in the immediate post-transplant period or when oral medication is not feasible. The dosage is determined by the physician based on the individual's needs and will generally be adjusted to match the equivalent oral dose.

* **Children:** Pediatric dosing is significantly different and strictly determined by weight and the specific condition.  There are specialized formulations and dosage calculations for children, managed under the close supervision of a pediatrician or pediatric nephrologist (for kidney transplants).


### Side Effects

Common side effects of mycophenolate mofetil include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Infections (increased susceptibility)
* Low white blood cell count (leukopenia)
* Anemia
* High blood pressure


Less common but serious side effects:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*  Kidney problems
* Liver problems
*  Lung problems
*  Increased risk of certain cancers (long-term use)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Mycophenolate mofetil works by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme called inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). IMPDH is crucial for the production of guanosine nucleotides, which are essential building blocks of DNA. By inhibiting IMPDH, mycophenolate mofetil reduces the production of DNA, thereby suppressing the proliferation of lymphocytes – a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune response.  By reducing lymphocyte activity, the drug lessens the body's ability to reject transplanted organs or attack its own tissues in autoimmune diseases.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mycophenolate mofetil is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug.  Pregnancy is also a major contraindication.

* **Drug Interactions:** Mycophenolate mofetil can interact with numerous other medications, including antacids, certain antibiotics, and antiviral drugs.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Mycophenolate mofetil is highly teratogenic (causes birth defects).  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 weeks after stopping the medication.  Breastfeeding is generally discouraged while taking mycophenolate mofetil.

* **Elderly:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.

* **Renal (Kidney) and Hepatic (Liver) Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are usually required in individuals with impaired kidney or liver function.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long do I need to take mycophenolate mofetil?** A: The duration of treatment depends on your condition and response to therapy.  In transplantation, it’s often a long-term medication. For autoimmune diseases, the duration may vary.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate treatment duration.

* **Q: Can I stop taking mycophenolate mofetil suddenly?** A: No, you should never stop taking mycophenolate mofetil without consulting your doctor.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to organ rejection or exacerbation of autoimmune symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store mycophenolate mofetil?** A: Store mycophenolate mofetil as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while on mycophenolate mofetil?** A:  There aren't strict dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy and balanced diet is always advisable.  Discuss any specific dietary concerns with your doctor or a registered dietitian.
