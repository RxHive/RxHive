# Milk of Magnesia
### Generic Name
Magnesium Hydroxide

### Usage
Milk of Magnesia, containing magnesium hydroxide, is primarily used as a laxative to relieve occasional constipation.  It works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and making it easier to pass. This effect typically occurs within a few hours of ingestion.  While its primary use is for constipation relief, it can also be used to treat heartburn and acid indigestion by neutralizing stomach acid.  However, it's crucial to remember that it's not a long-term solution for chronic constipation or heartburn;  ongoing issues require consultation with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the individual and the reason for use. Always follow the instructions on the product label, or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.

**For Constipation Relief (Oral):**

* **Adults:** The usual adult dose is 1 to 4 teaspoons (5 to 20 mL).  However, it's important not to exceed the recommended daily dose unless directed by a doctor.
* **Children:** Dosage for children depends on age and weight; always consult a doctor or pharmacist before administering to children.  Do not give to children under 2 years old without medical advice.

**For Heartburn/Acid Indigestion (Oral):**

* **Adults:** A typical dose is 1 to 2 teaspoons.

**Important Note:**  There's no standard IV administration for magnesium hydroxide as it's primarily an oral medication. Parenteral magnesium (different magnesium salts) is administered intravenously by healthcare professionals for specific medical conditions such as eclampsia (in pregnancy) or in cases of severe magnesium deficiency.  This should not be confused with the oral use of Milk of Magnesia.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and include:

* Diarrhea
* Stomach cramps
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dehydration (if severe diarrhea occurs)

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Irregular heartbeat
* Muscle weakness
* Low blood pressure
* Confusion


If you experience any serious side effects, stop taking Milk of Magnesia and contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Magnesium hydroxide works as a laxative by increasing the amount of water in the intestines. This softens the stool and stimulates bowel movements.  In the case of heartburn and acid indigestion, it acts as an antacid by neutralizing excess stomach acid.


### Precautions
* **Kidney Problems:** Individuals with kidney problems should use Milk of Magnesia with caution or avoid it altogether as it can lead to a build-up of magnesium in the blood (hypermagnesemia).
* **Heart Conditions:**  People with heart conditions should also exercise caution as high levels of magnesium can affect heart rhythm.
* **Other Medications:**  Milk of Magnesia can interact with certain medications, such as antibiotics and diuretics. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before using Milk of Magnesia during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Do not give Milk of Magnesia to children under 2 years of age without consulting a pediatrician.
