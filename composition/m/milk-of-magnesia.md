# Milk of Magnesia

**Generic Name:** Magnesium Hydroxide

**Usage:**  Milk of Magnesia (magnesium hydroxide) is used to relieve occasional constipation. It's also used to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, and acid indigestion.  It can be used as a short-term treatment for these conditions.  Some formulations are specifically designed for children.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the product label.

**Side Effects:**  While generally safe when used as directed, side effects can include:

* **Diarrhea:** This is a common side effect, especially with higher doses.
* **Stomach cramps:** These can be mild to moderate in severity.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Vomiting:** Though less common.
* **Dehydration:**  Prolonged or excessive diarrhea can lead to dehydration, particularly in elderly individuals or those with underlying health conditions.


**How it Works:** Magnesium hydroxide works as a laxative by drawing water into the intestines. This softens the stool and increases bowel movements.  As an antacid, it neutralizes stomach acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid in the stomach, providing relief from heartburn and indigestion.
