# Magnesium Bisglycinate
### Generic Name
Magnesium Bisglycinate

### Usage
Magnesium bisglycinate is primarily used as a dietary supplement to increase magnesium levels in the body.  Magnesium plays a crucial role in numerous bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control, blood pressure regulation, and protein synthesis.  Therefore, magnesium bisglycinate supplementation is often used to address magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia), which can manifest in various symptoms like muscle cramps, fatigue, weakness, and even more serious conditions if severe.  While not a treatment for specific diseases, it may be used as a supportive therapy alongside medical interventions for conditions where magnesium deficiency is a contributing factor or where improved magnesium levels might offer benefits.  Examples might include migraines, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and anxiety, although scientific evidence supporting these uses varies in strength. It's important to note that magnesium bisglycinate is not a substitute for medical treatment and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional if you have a diagnosed medical condition.

### Dosage
Dosage of magnesium bisglycinate varies depending on individual needs and the reason for supplementation.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist to determine the appropriate dosage for you.  Generally, recommended doses are found on the product label, which might range from 100mg to 400mg of elemental magnesium per serving, and taken once or twice daily.  Dosage may need adjusting depending on age, health status, and the severity of any magnesium deficiency.  There are different formulations available, including tablets and capsules.  It's crucial to follow the instructions provided with the specific product.  Children should only take magnesium bisglycinate under strict medical supervision.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of magnesium bisglycinate are generally mild and include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Stomach upset
* Vomiting

Less common but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, include:

* Severe diarrhea (potentially indicating a dangerously high magnesium level)
* Low blood pressure
* Irregular heartbeat
* Muscle weakness


If you experience any adverse effects, stop taking the supplement and consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Magnesium bisglycinate is a chelated form of magnesium, meaning it's bound to glycine, an amino acid. This chelation improves magnesium absorption, particularly in individuals with impaired digestion or those who have difficulty absorbing magnesium from other sources. Once ingested, the bisglycinate complex is readily absorbed in the intestines, without the need for substantial stomach acid, and the magnesium is then distributed throughout the body to perform its various biological functions.


### Precautions
* **Interactions:** Magnesium bisglycinate can interact with certain medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and some heart medications. Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Kidney Disease:** Individuals with kidney disease should exercise extreme caution, as magnesium can accumulate to harmful levels in the blood. Supplementation should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe in moderate amounts, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using magnesium bisglycinate.
* **Other Conditions:** People with conditions affecting magnesium metabolism or absorption should consult a doctor before using this supplement.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take magnesium bisglycinate on an empty stomach?**  A: While magnesium bisglycinate is better absorbed than some other forms of magnesium, taking it with food might help reduce potential stomach upset for some individuals.
* **Q: How should I store magnesium bisglycinate?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as per the label instructions.
* **Q: Is magnesium bisglycinate safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use should be discussed with a healthcare professional.  Regular blood tests might be necessary to monitor magnesium levels.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can magnesium bisglycinate cause drowsiness?** A: While drowsiness is not a common side effect, it's always best to monitor your response to the supplement, especially if you drive or operate machinery.
