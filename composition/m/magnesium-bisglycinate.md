**Generic Name:** Magnesium Bisglycinate

**Usage:** Magnesium bisglycinate is a form of magnesium used to treat or prevent low levels of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesemia).  It's also used to support various bodily functions and may be taken for:

* **Improving sleep quality:** Some find it helps with sleep onset and duration.
* **Reducing anxiety and stress:**  Magnesium plays a role in neurotransmitter function related to mood regulation.
* **Relieving muscle cramps and spasms:** Magnesium is involved in muscle contraction and relaxation.

* **Drowsiness:**  Especially at higher doses.
* **Low blood pressure:** In rare instances, especially with pre-existing conditions or high doses.


**How it Works:** Magnesium bisglycinate is a chelated form of magnesium, meaning it's bound to glycine, an amino acid. This chelation enhances magnesium absorption in the gut, making it more bioavailable compared to some other magnesium forms. Once absorbed, magnesium plays a vital role in numerous bodily functions, including:

* **Muscle and nerve function:**  Magnesium is essential for muscle contraction and relaxation, and nerve impulse transmission.
* **Blood sugar control:**  It's involved in insulin regulation.
* **Blood pressure regulation:**  It affects blood vessel dilation and contraction.
* **Protein synthesis:**  It's necessary for building and repairing tissues.
* **Energy production:**  It participates in energy metabolism.
