# Mometasone + Salicylic Acid

**Generic Name:** Mometasone Furoate + Salicylic Acid

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid (mometasone furoate) and a keratolytic (salicylic acid) used to treat plaque psoriasis.  It reduces inflammation and scaling associated with the condition.  It's typically applied to affected areas of the skin once or twice daily as directed by a doctor.  The exact usage instructions will depend on the specific formulation and the severity of the psoriasis.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  They can include:

* **Burning or stinging:**  This is common, especially initially.
* **Itching:**  May occur at the application site.
* **Skin irritation:**  Redness, dryness, or peeling.
* **Thinning of the skin:**  Prolonged use can lead to skin thinning (atrophy).
* **Stretch marks (striae):**  Possible with long-term use.
* **Acne:** In rare instances.
* **Skin discoloration (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation):**  Changes in skin color.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:** A rare allergic reaction to the medication.


**How it Works:**

* **Mometasone Furoate:** This is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the skin. It suppresses the immune system's response in the affected area, thereby decreasing redness, swelling, and itching.
* **Salicylic Acid:** This is a keratolytic agent, meaning it helps to soften and remove the scales and plaques characteristic of psoriasis. It works by breaking down the bonds between skin cells, making them easier to shed.

The combination of these two active ingredients provides a synergistic effect, addressing both the inflammation and scaling of psoriasis more effectively than either ingredient alone.
