# Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Folic Acid + Selenium dioxide + Calcium Pantothenate + ThiamineVitamin B + Vitamin B + Vitamin E + Vitamin A + Chromium polynicotinate + Inositol
### Generic Name

Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Folic Acid + Selenium dioxide + Calcium Pantothenate + Thiamine + Riboflavin + Pyridoxine + Vitamin B12 + Vitamin E + Vitamin A + Chromium Polynicotinate + Inositol (Note: This is a combination product; no single generic name exists.)


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to address nutritional deficiencies and support neurological function.  It's often used to treat or prevent deficiencies in vitamins B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine), B12 (methylcobalamin), and other essential nutrients included in the formula.  The combination is often prescribed or recommended to support nerve health, potentially benefiting individuals with conditions such as peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the arms and legs), diabetic neuropathy, or other neurological conditions related to nutrient deficiencies.  Alpha-lipoic acid acts as an antioxidant, which may offer additional support to nerve health.  Folic acid is crucial for cell growth and function, while selenium and other vitamins and minerals contribute to overall health and well-being.  Importantly, this formulation does *not* replace a healthy diet and lifestyle.  It should be considered a supplement, not a cure, for underlying conditions.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using this product to determine if it's appropriate for your specific needs.
