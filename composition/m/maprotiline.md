# Maprotiline
### Generic Name
Maprotiline

### Usage
Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant primarily used to treat depressive disorders.  Its main application is in managing depressive neurosis (dysthymic disorder) and major depressive disorder (manic depressive illness, depressed type).  It's also helpful in alleviating anxiety frequently associated with depression.  It's important to note that maprotiline is not a first-line treatment for depression and is typically considered after other antidepressants have been tried.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  Dosage is highly individualized and depends on the severity of the depression and the patient's response.

* **Outpatients (mild to moderate depression):** The usual starting dose is 75 mg daily for two weeks. The doctor may then increase the dose in increments of 25 mg until an effective dose is reached, up to a maximum of 150 mg daily. Once symptoms are controlled, the dose may be reduced to a maintenance level of 75-150 mg daily.  Older adults typically start with a lower dose of 50-75 mg daily.

* **Inpatients (severe depression):**  Treatment usually begins with a higher initial dose of 100-150 mg daily for two weeks. The dose can be cautiously increased to the effective dose, with a maximum of 225 mg daily. Again, older adults should receive a lower starting dose (50-75 mg daily).

**Children:** Maprotiline is not approved for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, close monitoring is necessary.  A 14-day washout period is recommended when switching between maprotiline and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%):**  A wide range of rare side effects have been reported, including but not limited to:  cardiac arrhythmias, seizures,  blood disorders (agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia),  liver problems,  severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis),  and changes in mental state (psychosis, mania).  

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant.  Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood but it's believed to primarily work by increasing the levels of norepinephrine in the brain. It achieves this by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine into nerve cells, making more of it available to interact with receptors and influence mood.  Maprotiline may also affect other neurotransmitters like serotonin, but to a lesser extent than norepinephrine.  By increasing norepinephrine, it helps to regulate mood and alleviate depressive symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Maprotiline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, severe cardiovascular disorders, narrow-angle glaucoma, and those with conditions that prolong the QT interval (a measure of heart rhythm). It should not be used with MAOIs or within 14 days of discontinuing an MAOI, and vice-versa. Avoid use in patients recovering from a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

* **Interactions:**  Caution is needed when using maprotiline with other medications, particularly anticholinergics (which can worsen dry mouth and constipation), sympathomimetics (which can increase heart rate and blood pressure), guanethidine (a blood pressure medication),  and drugs that affect liver enzymes (which can alter maprotiline levels). Concomitant use with phenothiazines or rapid benzodiazepine tapering may increase seizure risk.


* **Warnings:**  Maprotiline carries a boxed warning regarding the increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults.  Close monitoring is crucial for all ages, especially when starting or adjusting the dose.  Older adults are also more vulnerable to side effects and require careful dose adjustment.  Patients with diabetes, a history of seizures, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, or those taking other medications should use caution.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a doctor before starting maprotiline.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for maprotiline to work?** A: While some effects may be seen within 3-7 days, it usually takes 2-3 weeks to experience the full therapeutic benefit.

* **Q: Can I stop taking maprotiline suddenly?** A: No. Abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before stopping the medication.  Tapering off is usually recommended.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking maprotiline?** A: It's best to avoid alcohol while taking maprotiline as it can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.

* **Q: How should I store maprotiline?** A: Store maprotiline in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture, as directed on the label. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose.
