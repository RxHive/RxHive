# Midodrine
### Generic Name
Midodrine

### Usage

Midodrine is primarily used to treat symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.  This condition causes a significant drop in blood pressure when a person stands up from a lying or sitting position, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, and even fainting.  Midodrine helps to counteract this drop by constricting blood vessels, thus raising blood pressure.

While its primary use is for orthostatic hypotension, midodrine is sometimes used off-label in other situations where blood pressure needs to be raised.  These off-label uses include managing ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen) in cirrhotic patients with resistant hypotension, aiding in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (type 1), preventing hemodialysis-induced hypotension, managing vasovagal syncope (fainting), improving blood pressure in intensive care settings to reduce the need for vasopressors, and in some cases, managing postural tachycardia syndrome.  It's crucial to remember that these are off-label uses, meaning they aren't officially approved by regulatory agencies for these specific conditions.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriateness of off-label use based on individual patient circumstances.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated and the patient's response. It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescribed dosage regimen precisely.  Here's a general overview:

**Adults:**  The typical starting dose for orthostatic hypotension is 2.5 mg three times daily (TID) during the daytime hours, several hours before bedtime to avoid supine hypertension (high blood pressure while lying down). The dose can be increased gradually, as directed by a physician, up to a maximum of 10 mg TID.  For off-label uses, the starting dose and maximum dose differ significantly.  A healthcare provider will tailor the dosage to the individual's needs.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of midodrine in children have not been established, and it should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage forms:** Midodrine is usually available as oral tablets.

**Administration:** Midodrine should be taken orally with food. It's important to avoid doses within four hours of bedtime to minimize the risk of supine hypertension.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare provider will provide guidance on appropriate adjustments based on the patient's individual condition.  Midodrine is dialyzable, meaning it can be removed from the blood during hemodialysis.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**

* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Supine hypertension (high blood pressure while lying down)
* Dysuria (painful urination)
* Urinary retention (inability to empty the bladder)
* Urinary urgency
* Piloerection (goosebumps)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Polyuria (increased urination)

**Less common, but potentially serious side effects:**

* Chills
* Pain
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Anxiety
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nausea

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Midodrine is a prodrug; it's converted in the body to its active form, desglymidodrine. This active metabolite acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist.  This means it stimulates alpha-1 receptors in blood vessels, causing them to constrict (narrow).  This constriction increases peripheral vascular resistance, thereby raising blood pressure, particularly when standing.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Midodrine is contraindicated in patients with severe organic heart disease, acute renal disease, urinary retention, pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), thyrotoxicosis (overactive thyroid), persistent and excessive supine hypertension, and poorly controlled hypertension.

* **Interactions:**  Midodrine can interact with several other medications, including alpha-1 blockers, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and other medications that affect blood pressure or heart rate.  It's vital to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting midodrine.

* **Warnings:**  Midodrine can cause a significant increase in blood pressure when lying down.  Patients should be monitored for this effect.  Patients with diabetes, liver or kidney problems, visual problems (especially those taking fludrocortisone), or those who are breastfeeding require careful monitoring while taking midodrine.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Midodrine is a Category C drug during pregnancy, meaning the potential risks to the fetus are not fully understood.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered. The excretion of midodrine in breast milk is unknown; caution should be exercised if breastfeeding.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Midodrine to work?**

A: The effects of Midodrine typically become apparent within a few minutes to an hour after administration.

**Q: How should I store Midodrine?**

A: Store Midodrine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

**Q: Can I stop taking Midodrine suddenly?**

A: No, you should not stop taking Midodrine suddenly.  Stopping abruptly can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure.  Always consult your healthcare provider before discontinuing the medication; they will usually recommend a gradual tapering of the dose.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose of Midodrine?**

A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's within 3 hours of your next scheduled dose.  Do not double the dose to catch up.

**Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Midodrine?**

A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Midodrine, as alcohol can affect blood pressure and potentially interact with the medication.  Always consult your physician or pharmacist for advice on alcohol consumption while on any medication.
