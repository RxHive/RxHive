# Midodrine

**Generic Name:** Midodrine

**Usage:** Midodrine is used to treat symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH).  Orthostatic hypotension is a condition where blood pressure drops significantly when you stand up from a sitting or lying position. This can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and even fainting.  It's specifically prescribed for patients whose symptoms significantly impact their quality of life and are not adequately controlled by other measures.  It's *not* a first-line treatment for OH and is usually used after other options have been tried.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects of midodrine include:

* **Goosebumps (piloerection):** This is a very common side effect.
* **Itching:** Can be localized or widespread.
* **Chills:** Often associated with goosebumps.
* **Increased blood pressure:** While this is the intended effect, it can sometimes be excessive, especially in supine position (lying down).  This is why it's crucial to monitor blood pressure regularly, especially while lying down.
* **Headache:** Can range from mild to moderate.
* **Nausea:** Less common but possible.
* **Difficulty urinating:**  This is a more serious side effect and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Elevated heart rate (tachycardia):** Can be a concern in certain patients.

Rare but serious side effects include:

* **Severe high blood pressure (hypertensive crisis):** Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Stroke:** A very rare but serious complication.


**How it Works:** Midodrine works by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels.  This causes constriction of the blood vessels, particularly in the legs and arms. The constriction increases peripheral vascular resistance, which helps to raise blood pressure when standing.  The effects are primarily seen in a standing position.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take midodrine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications can interact negatively with midodrine, potentially increasing the risk of side effects or reducing its effectiveness.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of midodrine usually start within 30-60 minutes of taking a dose.
* **How long should I take midodrine?**  The duration of treatment depends on your individual response and is determined by your doctor.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Simply take the next dose as scheduled.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking midodrine?** Alcohol can interact with midodrine and worsen its side effects, especially concerning blood pressure. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Can I take midodrine if I have kidney problems?**  Kidney function should be monitored carefully while on midodrine, as it is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Individuals with severe kidney disease may need dosage adjustments or alternative treatments.
* **Can I stop taking midodrine suddenly?**  Stopping midodrine suddenly can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure.  You should always taper off the medication under your doctor's supervision.
