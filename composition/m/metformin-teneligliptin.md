# Metformin + Teneligliptin

**Generic Name:** Metformin + Teneligliptin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to improve blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes.  It's typically used when metformin alone is not enough to control blood sugar levels.  It's a second-line treatment option, meaning it's used after metformin monotherapy has been tried.  The doctor will determine the appropriate dosage and frequency based on the individual's needs and response to treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary from person to person but may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  These are common with metformin and can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.  These side effects often lessen over time as the body adjusts.
* **Lactacidosis:** A rare but serious side effect, especially in individuals with kidney problems. Symptoms can include muscle pain, weakness, unusual tiredness, and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms occur.
* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):**  More likely if also taking other diabetes medications or insulin. Symptoms can include sweating, trembling, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and confusion.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but can include rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.
* **Vitamin B12 deficiency:**  Metformin can interfere with B12 absorption.
* **Other possible side effects:** Headache, dizziness, metallic taste,  constipation.


**How it Works:**

This combination medication works in two ways to lower blood sugar:

* **Metformin:** Works primarily by decreasing glucose production in the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in the muscles and fat tissue, improving the body's ability to use insulin effectively.
* **Teneligliptin:**  Belongs to a class of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors.  It works by increasing the levels of incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP). These hormones stimulate insulin release after meals and reduce glucagon secretion (a hormone that raises blood sugar).


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take this medication if I have kidney problems?**  A:  Metformin can be harmful to the kidneys, and its use is generally contraindicated or requires careful monitoring in people with moderate to severe kidney disease.  Your doctor will assess your kidney function before prescribing this medication.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of lactic acidosis, a serious side effect of metformin.  Moderate alcohol consumption may be acceptable, but it's crucial to discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No,  stopping this medication abruptly can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, there are potential drug interactions.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Q:  How is this medication different from other diabetes medications?** A: This combination offers a dual mechanism of action, addressing glucose production and insulin sensitivity differently than other diabetes drugs. This approach can be more effective for some individuals than single-agent therapy.
