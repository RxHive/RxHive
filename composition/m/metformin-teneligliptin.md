# Metformin + Teneligliptin
### Generic Name
Metformin + Teneligliptin

### Usage

Metformin + Teneligliptin is a combination medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.  It's specifically designed for individuals whose blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled with metformin alone.  The combination leverages the strengths of both drugs: metformin, which improves insulin sensitivity and reduces glucose production by the liver, and teneligliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor that enhances the body's natural ability to release insulin when blood sugar is elevated.  This dual action helps to lower blood glucose levels more effectively than either drug in isolation.  While primarily used for type 2 diabetes, it's crucial to remember that this medication doesn't treat type 1 diabetes.


### Dosage

Dosage of Metformin + Teneligliptin varies depending on individual needs and response to treatment.  A healthcare professional will determine the appropriate starting dose and adjust it as necessary.  Generally, the medication is taken orally, typically once daily with a meal to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.  

* **Adults:**  The recommended starting dose is usually one tablet daily.  This dose might be adjusted based on blood glucose levels and individual patient factors.  Maximum daily dosage should be determined by a healthcare provider.  
* **Children:** This medication is not generally approved for use in children.
* **IV Administration:** This combination medication is not administered intravenously. It's solely for oral use.


Specific dosage forms (e.g., tablet strengths) will vary depending on the brand and manufacturer.  Always follow the directions on your prescription label and consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of Metformin + Teneligliptin can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Upper respiratory tract infection


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, may include:

* Lactic acidosis (a rare but serious condition characterized by the buildup of lactic acid in the blood)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), especially if used in combination with other diabetes medications or insulin
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)


If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Metformin + Teneligliptin combines two distinct mechanisms to manage type 2 diabetes:

* **Metformin:** It primarily works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin.  Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose enter cells from the bloodstream.  By improving insulin sensitivity, metformin helps the body use glucose more effectively.

* **Teneligliptin:** This is a DPP-4 inhibitor.  DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretins. Incretins are hormones that stimulate insulin release after a meal.  By inhibiting DPP-4, teneligliptin increases the levels of incretins, leading to a greater release of insulin when blood sugar is high.


The combination of these two mechanisms provides a more comprehensive approach to blood sugar control in individuals with type 2 diabetes.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Metformin + Teneligliptin is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney disease, liver disease, or a history of lactic acidosis.  It's also not recommended for individuals with a severe infection or those undergoing procedures that could compromise kidney function.

* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination medication can interact with other drugs, including some diuretics, certain antibiotics, and other diabetes medications.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of Metformin + Teneligliptin during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Discuss these considerations with your doctor before taking this medication if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Regular monitoring of kidney and liver function is often necessary, as these organs play a crucial role in processing this medication.

* **Alcohol Consumption:** Excessive alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking this medication, as it can increase the risk of lactic acidosis.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Metformin + Teneligliptin suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking this medication abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping it suddenly can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels.

* **Q: How should I store Metformin + Teneligliptin?** A: Store the medication in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Does Metformin + Teneligliptin cause weight gain?** A:  While some individuals may experience minimal weight changes, it is not typically associated with significant weight gain. However, individual responses vary.

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Limit or avoid alcohol consumption as it can increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Discuss alcohol consumption with your healthcare provider.
