# Meclizine + Folic Acid
### Generic Name
Meclizine + Folic Acid

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat the symptoms of nausea and vomiting, particularly those associated with motion sickness (such as car sickness, seasickness, and airsickness).  Meclizine is an antihistamine with antiemetic properties, meaning it helps to prevent and control nausea and vomiting. Folic acid is a B vitamin crucial for cell growth and development.  While not directly treating nausea, its inclusion is sometimes beneficial in cases where nausea might lead to nutrient deficiencies, especially in pregnant women.  This combination is not typically used to treat other forms of nausea or vomiting, such as those caused by chemotherapy or gastroenteritis.  Always consult a doctor to determine if this combination is appropriate for your specific situation.

### Dosage

Dosage varies based on the specific product formulation and the patient's age and condition.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions meticulously.  There is no standard IV formulation for this combination; it's typically administered orally.  Information below is for general guidance only and should not be interpreted as medical advice.  Always consult a healthcare professional for correct dosage.

### How it Works

Meclizine works by blocking the action of histamine in the central nervous system. Histamine can stimulate the vomiting center in the brain, leading to nausea and vomiting. By blocking histamine, Meclizine reduces these effects, helping to prevent and control motion sickness. Folic acid plays a vital role in cell growth and DNA synthesis. Its inclusion in this combination may be beneficial to prevent nutritional deficiencies that can arise from persistent nausea and vomiting, ensuring that the body has sufficient nutrients for repair and growth.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  While folic acid is generally safe during pregnancy, mecliazine should be used with caution.
