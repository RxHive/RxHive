# Mafenide
### Generic Name
Mafenide

### Usage
Mafenide is a topical sulfonamide antibiotic used primarily as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of second- and third-degree burns.  The cream formulation is applied directly to the burn wound to help control bacterial infection.  A powder formulation, which is reconstituted into a solution, is also available and used to manage bacterial infection under moist dressings over meshed autografts on excised burn wounds.  It's crucial to understand that Mafenide is not a standalone treatment for burns; it works alongside other burn management strategies.


### Dosage
**Burn Treatment (Cream, 85 mg/g):**

* **Adults and Children:** Apply a thin layer (approximately 1/16 inch thick) once or twice daily to the affected area.  Ensure complete coverage of the burn wound. Continue treatment until the wound shows significant healing or is ready for grafting.  Use a sterile, gloved hand for application.

**Burn Treatment (Powder for Solution, 5%):**

* **Adults and Children (â‰¥3 months):**  Reconstitute the powder as directed.  Saturate an 8-ply burn dressing with the solution and apply one layer of fine mesh gauze over the grafted area. Maintain a consistently moist dressing by irrigating every 4 hours (or as needed) or by moistening every 6-8 hours (or as needed). Secure the dressing appropriately. Continue until the autograft is vascularized and healing progresses (dressings may remain in place for up to 5 days).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment due to the potential for accumulation of Mafenide and its metabolite, which may enhance carbonic anhydrase inhibition.  In cases of severe metabolic acidosis, temporarily discontinuing treatment for 24-48 hours may help restore acid-base balance.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Erythema (redness)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Rash
* Burning sensation at the application site
* Maceration (softening of the skin)
* Pain at the application site


Less common, but potentially serious side effects:

* Metabolic acidosis (a serious imbalance of the body's acid-base levels)
* Hyperchloremia (high levels of chloride in the blood)
* Edema (swelling)
* Allergic reactions (including hypersensitivity)

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones,  consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Mafenide is a sulfonamide antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria.  Folic acid is essential for bacterial growth and reproduction. By interfering with this process, Mafenide prevents the growth and multiplication of bacteria, thereby helping to control infection in burn wounds.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Mafenide is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Mafenide or any formulation component.

* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and those with acute renal impairment.  Mafenide can cause metabolic acidosis, particularly in patients with extensive burns or pre-existing renal or pulmonary impairment.  Monitor acid-base balance closely during treatment.  A risk of acid-base imbalance, sulfonamide allergy, and fungal or bacterial superinfection exists.

* **Drug Interactions:**  The risk of adverse effects is increased when Mafenide is used concurrently with dapsone, dexketoprofen, mecamylamine, prilocaine, and sodium nitrite.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Mafenide is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It's generally not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless the burn area exceeds 20% of the total body surface area and the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; a decision on whether to discontinue nursing or the medication should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the mother's need for the treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can Mafenide be used on all types of wounds?** A: No, it is primarily indicated for the treatment of second- and third-degree burns.

* **Q: How should I store Mafenide?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I use other topical medications simultaneously with Mafenide?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist.  Using multiple topical agents simultaneously may increase the risk of skin irritation or interaction.

* **Q:  What are the signs of a serious allergic reaction?** A: Serious allergic reactions may include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.
