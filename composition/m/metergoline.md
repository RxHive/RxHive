# Metergoline
### Generic Name
Metergoline

### Usage
Metergoline, derived from ergot alkaloids, is primarily used as a dopamine agonist. Its main applications include:

* **Hyperprolactinemia:**  Metergoline effectively treats elevated prolactin levels, a hormonal imbalance causing various issues in both men and women, such as menstrual irregularities in women and reduced libido or infertility in men.
* **Lactation Prevention:**  It's used to suppress lactation (milk production) after childbirth, particularly when breastfeeding is undesirable or contraindicated.
* **Hyperprolactinemic Amenorrhea:** This medication helps restore menstrual cycles in women experiencing amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) due to high prolactin levels.
* **Vascular Migraine and Headache Prophylaxis:** Metergoline can be used to prevent the occurrence of vascular migraines and headaches.
* **Accelerated Intestinal Transit Syndromes:** It's also employed in managing conditions characterized by abnormally rapid bowel movements.
* **Intestinal Chromaffinomas:**  This medication may be used in the management of certain types of intestinal tumors (chromaffinomas).

### Dosage

Metergoline dosage varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and instructions carefully.  The information below is for general understanding and should not replace personalized medical advice.  Metergoline is typically administered orally.

* **Hyperprolactinemia (Adults):**  The starting dose is generally 12 mg daily, divided into multiple doses, with a maximum dose of 24 mg daily for men.
* **Lactation Prevention (Adults):** A typical regimen involves 4 mg three times a day for seven days, starting within 24 hours of delivery.
* **Hyperprolactinemic Amenorrhea (Adults):** The initial dose is usually lower (2 mg three times a day for the first 3-4 days), gradually increasing to 4 mg three times a day. Treatment continues for at least 90 days or until menstruation returns.

Less common but more serious side effects may occur.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.**

### How it Works

Metergoline is a dopamine agonist, meaning it stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain.  It also acts as a serotonin antagonist, blocking the effects of serotonin.  By influencing these neurotransmitters, Metergoline helps regulate prolactin release from the pituitary gland, impacting conditions related to hyperprolactinemia.  Its action on serotonin receptors may also contribute to its effectiveness in migraine prophylaxis.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Metergoline is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Metergoline or its components and in breastfeeding women.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using Metergoline in patients with hepatic (liver) or cardiovascular disease.
* **Pregnancy:**  Metergoline should only be used during pregnancy when the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks to the fetus.
* **Lactation:** Because Metergoline suppresses lactation, it is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Interactions:**  Interactions with other medications are possible. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking before starting Metergoline.
* **Alcohol:**  Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment with Metergoline.
