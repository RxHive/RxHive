# Methyl Salicylate
### Generic Name
Methyl Salicylate

### Usage
Methyl salicylate, also known as oil of wintergreen or wintergreen oil, is primarily used topically for the symptomatic relief of muscle and rheumatic pain.  This includes conditions like sciatica, lumbago, fibrositis, sprains, strains, bruises, and muscle stiffness. It works by creating a counterirritant effect, distracting from the underlying pain.  It's important to note that methyl salicylate does not cure the underlying condition but rather provides temporary pain relief.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For pain relief, methyl salicylate is typically applied topically as an ointment (50% concentration) or liniment (25% concentration).  The appropriate amount should be applied to the affected area and gently rubbed in.  Specific application instructions will vary depending on the product formulation.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The use of methyl salicylate in children is generally not recommended due to the risk of salicylate poisoning, a serious condition.  Always consult a pediatrician before using any medication containing methyl salicylate on a child.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling. However, individuals with severe liver or kidney disease should consult their doctor before use.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are rare with topical application but may include:

* Skin irritation (redness, rash, itching) at the application site.
* Allergic reactions (rare), including angioedema (swelling) and urticaria (hives).


Serious side effects are uncommon but can occur if significant amounts are absorbed through the skin.  These may include systemic salicylate toxicity, characterized by symptoms like nausea, vomiting, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and potentially more serious effects.   Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious adverse effects.


### How it Works
Methyl salicylate acts as a counterirritant. When applied topically, it stimulates the superficial sensory nerves in the skin. This stimulation creates a sensation of warmth and mild burning, which distracts from the underlying pain signals from deeper tissues (muscles and joints). The vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) that occurs may also contribute to pain relief.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Methyl salicylate should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to methyl salicylate, other salicylates, or arachis (peanut) oil (often a component of formulations).
* **Skin Application Only:** Methyl salicylate is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and broken or inflamed skin.
* **Burns:**  There is a risk of burns, ranging from first- to third-degree, at the application site, especially with prolonged or excessive application or occlusion (covering the area).
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** While the systemic absorption from topical use is generally low, pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using methyl salicylate.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While generally low, the systemic absorption of salicylates may theoretically interact with other medications.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.
* **Children:**  Avoid use in children due to the risk of salicylate poisoning.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of pain relief varies, but it usually starts within minutes of application.

* **Q: Can I use it more than once a day?** A: Follow the product-specific instructions.  Overuse can increase the risk of skin irritation or systemic absorption.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store methyl salicylate products in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally get it in my eyes?** A: Immediately flush your eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention if irritation persists.

* **Q: Is it safe to use with other topical pain relievers?** A: It's best to avoid combining it with other topical medications without consulting a doctor or pharmacist, as potential interactions or increased irritation may occur.
