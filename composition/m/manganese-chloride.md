# Manganese Chloride
### Generic Name
Manganese Chloride

### Usage
Manganese chloride is primarily used in parenteral nutrition (PN) solutions to prevent manganese deficiency.  Manganese is an essential trace mineral crucial for various metabolic processes within the body.  Prolonged manganese deficiency can lead to a range of health issues. While its primary use is preventative in PN, it's also sometimes used off-label in the treatment of osteoporosis, although this application requires further research to solidify its efficacy and safety.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Parenteral Nutrition (Prevention of Deficiency):** The intravenous (IV) dosage typically ranges from 150 to 800 mcg per day. The exact dose will be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and the overall composition of the PN solution.
* **Osteoporosis (Off-Label):**  Oral administration of 5 mg/day has been explored, but the efficacy and safety for this indication need more robust clinical evidence.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Parenteral Nutrition (Prevention of Deficiency):** The intravenous (IV) dosage is usually 2-10 mcg/kg/day. The precise amount will be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's weight, age, and overall health status.
* Note that the dietary reference intake (DRI) for manganese varies significantly with age and developmental stage in children, ranging from 0.3-0.6 mg/day in infants under 6 months to 1.6-2.2 mg/day in older children and adolescents.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with liver problems (hepatic impairment), potentially requiring a reduced dose or temporary discontinuation, especially if there are signs of bile duct obstruction (cholestatic disease).
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in individuals with kidney disease (renal impairment), as manganese chloride injection solutions may contain aluminum.  

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally rare at therapeutic doses but may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea

Serious but less common side effects can occur with excessive manganese intake (manganese toxicity), and may include:

* Neurological problems (including parkinsonism-like symptoms)
* Liver damage
* Psychiatric symptoms

**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, immediately contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Manganese acts as a cofactor for various enzymes involved in important metabolic processes. It plays a role in the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and mucopolysaccharides, all of which are essential for different bodily functions.  By ensuring adequate manganese levels, the body can perform these processes efficiently, preventing deficiencies that might lead to health problems.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Direct intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection of manganese chloride is contraindicated.  It should only be administered as part of a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with impaired biliary function (problems with the bile ducts), liver disease, kidney disease, and premature infants.  
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Manganese chloride is classified as Category C during pregnancy, meaning its safety for use during pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  Manganese is present in breast milk, so caution is warranted during breastfeeding.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take manganese chloride supplements without a doctor's prescription?** A:  No, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before taking any manganese supplements, including manganese chloride, to determine the appropriate dosage and ensure safety, as excessive intake can be harmful.
* **Q: How is manganese chloride administered?** A:  It's typically administered intravenously as part of a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution to prevent manganese deficiency. Off-label oral forms exist but require medical supervision.
* **Q: How should I store manganese chloride?** A:  Storage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation. Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional or pharmacist.
* **Q:  What happens if I take too much manganese chloride?** A:  Excessive manganese intake can lead to manganese toxicity, which can cause various serious health problems, including neurological, hepatic, and psychiatric issues.
