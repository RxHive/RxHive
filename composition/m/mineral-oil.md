# Mineral Oil
### Generic Name
Mineral Oil

### Usage
Mineral oil is primarily used as a laxative for the temporary relief of occasional constipation.  It works by lubricating the intestines and preventing the absorption of water in the colon, making bowel movements easier to pass.  It's also used to relieve fecal impaction (severe constipation) and to remove barium sulfate residue after barium-based medical imaging procedures (like barium enemas).  Mineral oil is not intended for long-term use.

### Dosage
**Important Note:**  Do not use mineral oil orally for more than one week. Consult a healthcare professional if constipation persists.  Dosages vary depending on the formulation (plain liquid, emulsion/suspension), route of administration (oral or rectal), and the age and condition of the patient.  Always follow the directions on the product label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Adults:**

* **Constipation (Oral, plain liquid):** 15-45 mL in 24 hours (maximum 45 mL/day). This can be taken as a single dose (usually at bedtime) or in divided doses.
* **Constipation (Oral, emulsion/suspension):** 30-90 mL/day (maximum 90 mL/day). This can be taken as a single dose or in up to 3 divided doses.
* **Fecal impaction or post-barium studies (Rectal):** 118 mL as a single dose.

**Children:**

* **Oral use is not recommended for children under 6 years old.**
* **Rectal use is not recommended for children under 2 years old.**
* Dosages for children aged 6-11 years and those 12 years and older vary significantly depending on the formulation and method of administration.  Precise pediatric dosing should always be determined by a pediatrician or healthcare professional.  They will consider factors such as the child's age, weight, and the severity of constipation.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Oily rectal leakage (especially with large doses)
* Anal irritation, hemorrhoids, perianal discomfort, pruritus ani (anal itching), and soiling of clothing.

Less common, but serious side effects can include:

* Aspiration pneumonia (inhaling mineral oil into the lungs). This is particularly dangerous for bedridden patients or those with swallowing difficulties.
* Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) with long-term use.

If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Mineral oil acts as a lubricant and stool softener. When taken orally, it prevents the absorption of water in the intestines, softening the stool and making it easier to pass. Rectally administered, it lubricates the stool and intestinal walls, facilitating bowel movement.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Mineral oil is contraindicated in children under 6 years old (oral) or under 2 years old (rectal), pregnant women, bedridden patients, elderly individuals, those with difficulty swallowing (oral administration only), and for long-term use (more than one week).
* **Interactions:** Mineral oil can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and other medications, including some vitamins and minerals.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking.  If possible, avoid taking mineral oil simultaneously with other medications.  A significant time interval should be observed between taking mineral oil and other drugs.
* **Warnings:**  Aspiration of mineral oil into the lungs can cause lipid pneumonia, which is a serious condition. This is especially important to consider for those with conditions affecting swallowing. Elderly patients should use mineral oil cautiously and only as a last resort for managing constipation.  The long-term effects of mineral oil on health are not fully understood.  Therefore, it's crucial to use it only when necessary for short durations.
