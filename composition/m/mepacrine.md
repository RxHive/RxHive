# Mepacrine
### Generic Name
Mepacrine (Quinacrine)


### Usage
Mepacrine, also known as quinacrine, is primarily used as an antimalarial drug.  Its main application is in the treatment and prophylaxis (prevention) of malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium falciparum*, although its use has diminished significantly due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains and the availability of more effective and safer alternatives.  Historically, mepacrine also saw limited use in the treatment of giardiasis (a parasitic infection of the intestines) and extraintestinal amoebiasis, but these applications are now largely obsolete.  Its use should be guided by a physician due to its potential side effects and the availability of better-tolerated medications for these conditions.


### Dosage
**Dosage information provided here is for historical reference only and should not be interpreted as a prescription.  Always consult a medical professional for appropriate dosage and treatment.**  Mepacrine dosages vary greatly depending on the specific indication (malaria prophylaxis or treatment, other parasitic infections), the patient's age and weight, and the severity of the infection.  Precise dosing guidelines were historically established based on body weight (mg/kg) and administered in divided doses throughout the day, typically orally. Intravenous administration is not a typical route for mepacrine.  Due to the significant risk of side effects and the availability of safer alternatives, the precise current dosing recommendations are not readily available and shouldn't be attempted without consulting a specialist in infectious diseases.


### Side Effects
* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, skin discoloration (yellowing of skin and eyes - jaundice), and photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).
* **Less common, but serious side effects:**  Blood disorders (including agranulocytosis â€“ a severe decrease in white blood cells), liver damage (hepatotoxicity), and neurological effects (including psychosis).  Severe allergic reactions are also possible.


### How it Works
Mepacrine's antimalarial action is multifaceted.  It inhibits the growth and development of the malaria parasite within red blood cells, interfering with its DNA replication and protein synthesis.  The precise mechanisms are complex and not fully understood but involve interactions with various parasite enzymes and cellular processes. Its efficacy against *P. vivax* is linked to its ability to suppress exo-erythrocytic forms (parasites residing outside red blood cells in the liver).  For other indications, like giardiasis, its mechanism of action was also complex and not fully elucidated but likely involved interference with the parasite's metabolism and cellular functions.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Mepacrine should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or related compounds.  Pre-existing liver disease, blood disorders, and psoriasis are also significant contraindications.
* **Drug interactions:** Mepacrine can interact with various other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effectiveness or causing adverse effects. Consult a physician about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Mepacrine should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks, as it can potentially harm the fetus or infant.
* **Older adults and children:**  Mepacrine use in these populations requires careful monitoring due to an increased risk of side effects.  Again, due to safer alternatives, its use in these groups is not recommended.



### FAQs
* **Q: Is mepacrine still used to treat malaria?** A:  While it was historically important, mepacrine is rarely used today due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains and the availability of safer and more effective antimalarial drugs.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop taking mepacrine and consult a doctor immediately.
* **Q: How should I store mepacrine?** A:  (This information is not applicable as mepacrine is not commonly prescribed).  Refer to the specific packaging information if you are prescribed it.
* **Q: Are there any alternatives to mepacrine for malaria?** A: Yes, many safer and more effective antimalarial drugs are available. Your physician should discuss them with you.
* **Q: Can I take mepacrine with alcohol?** A:  Combining mepacrine with alcohol is not recommended due to the potential for increased side effects.

Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting or changing any medication.  The use of mepacrine should be carefully considered given the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for most of its previous indications.
