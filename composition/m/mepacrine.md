# Mepacrine

**Generic Name:** Mepacrine (also known as Quinacrine)

**Usage:**

Mepacrine's use has significantly diminished due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives.  Historically, it was primarily used for:

* **Malaria prophylaxis (prevention):**  This was its most common use, particularly for preventing certain types of malaria.  However, resistance has developed, making it less effective and rarely used for this purpose now.
* **Giardiasis (intestinal infection):**  Mepacrine was used to treat giardiasis, a parasitic infection of the intestines.  Again, newer treatments are generally preferred.
* **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE):** In some cases, it was explored as a treatment for SLE, but its use in this context is extremely limited.
* **Tapeworm infestations:** While effective against some types of tapeworms, it's not the first-line treatment.


**Side Effects:**

Mepacrine can cause a range of side effects, some of which can be severe.  These include:

* **Gastrointestinal problems:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* **Skin reactions:** Itching, rash, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* **Neurological effects:**  Headache, dizziness, confusion, psychosis (in rare cases)
* **Pigmentation changes:** Yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes (similar to jaundice), often reversible upon cessation of treatment.
* **Damage to the liver and kidneys:**  Rare but serious.
* **Blood disorders:**  Including rare cases of blood cell reduction.


**How it Works:**

Mepacrine's mechanism of action varies depending on the infection it's targeting.  Generally, it works by:

* **Interfering with parasitic DNA:**  In the case of malaria and giardiasis, it interferes with the parasite's DNA replication and other essential processes, leading to its death or inability to reproduce.
* **Modifying immune system function:** This is less clearly understood but may play a role in some of its therapeutic effects.

**FAQs:**

* **Is mepacrine still used?**  No, it is rarely used due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives for malaria and other infections.  Its use is largely historical.
* **Is mepacrine available over the counter?** No, it requires a prescription.
* **What are the long-term effects of mepacrine?** Long-term use can increase the risk of the side effects listed above, some of which may be irreversible.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Stop taking the medication immediately and consult a doctor.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Yes, mepacrine can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
