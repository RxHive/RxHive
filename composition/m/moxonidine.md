# Moxonidine
### Generic Name
Moxonidine

### Usage
Moxonidine is primarily used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension (high blood pressure).  It's a centrally acting antihypertensive medication, meaning it works by affecting the brain's control of blood pressure, rather than directly affecting blood vessels.  It is not typically used as a first-line treatment for hypertension but might be considered when other medications haven't been effective or are poorly tolerated.


### Dosage

**Adults (Essential Hypertension):** Moxonidine is usually administered orally.  The dosage is typically titrated upwards over several weeks:

* **Week 1-3:** 200 mcg once daily in the morning. The maximum dose at this stage is 200 mcg/day.
* **Week 4-6:**  Increased to 400 mcg once daily in the morning, or in two divided doses (morning and evening) if necessary. The maximum dose remains 400 mcg/day.
* **Week 7-9:**  Further increased to 600 mcg once daily in the morning, or in two divided doses if needed. The maximum dose remains 600 mcg/day.

Treatment continuation beyond the fourth week is only considered if necessary based on blood pressure readings.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of moxonidine in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment; however, caution is advised.
* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with reduced kidney function (GFR):
    * GFR > 60 mL/min: No adjustment needed.
    * GFR 60-30 mL/min: Maximum single dose of 200 mcg; maximum daily dose of 400 mcg.
    * GFR < 30 mL/min: Moxonidine is contraindicated.

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the more serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Moxonidine lowers blood pressure by acting on receptors in the brainstem (the lower part of the brain).  It's an agonist of the imidazoline I1 receptor.  By activating this receptor, it reduces the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for increasing heart rate and blood vessel constriction. This reduction in sympathetic activity leads to a decrease in blood pressure.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Moxonidine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to moxonidine or any formulation component.
* Congestive heart failure
* Malignant arrhythmias
* Bradycardia (resting heart rate <50 bpm)
* Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block
* Sick sinus syndrome
* Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min)
* Sinoatrial block


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with unstable angina, severe coronary artery disease, history of angioedema, mild renal impairment, first-degree AV block, Raynaud's syndrome, intermittent claudication, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, depression, or glaucoma.
* Moxonidine may enhance the hypotensive effects of other antihypertensives and the sedative effects of other CNS depressants (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines).
* Avoid abrupt discontinuation; gradually withdraw over 2 weeks.  If also taking a beta-blocker, withdraw the beta-blocker first.
* Pregnancy Category B: Use only if clearly needed.  It's excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended.
* Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment.
* May cause drowsiness; avoid activities requiring alertness (e.g., driving).


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take moxonidine with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Moxonidine can interact with other blood pressure medications and central nervous system depressants.
* **Q: How should I store moxonidine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Can I stop taking moxonidine suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping moxonidine can lead to rebound hypertension. Your doctor should supervise the gradual withdrawal process.
* **Q: Is moxonidine right for me?** A: Only your doctor can determine if moxonidine is the appropriate treatment for your condition.  They will consider your medical history, other medications, and overall health.
