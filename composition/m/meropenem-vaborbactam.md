# Meropenem + Vaborbactam
### Generic Name
Meropenem and Vaborbactam

### Usage
Meropenem and Vaborbactam is a combination antibiotic used to treat adults (18 years and older) with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), including pyelonephritis.  This infection is caused by bacteria susceptible to this drug combination.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is only effective against specific types of bacteria; your doctor will determine if it's the appropriate treatment for your infection.

### Dosage
The typical dosage for adults with cUTIs (including pyelonephritis) is 4 grams administered intravenously (IV) every 8 hours for a maximum of 14 days.  The infusion should be given over a period of 3 hours.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (renal impairment):

* **eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min:** No dosage adjustment needed.
* **eGFR 30–49 mL/min:** 2 grams every 8 hours.
* **eGFR 15–29 mL/min:** 2 grams every 12 hours.
* **eGFR < 15 mL/min:** 1 gram every 12 hours.
* **Hemodialysis:** Meropenem and Vaborbactam are dialyzable.  The dose should be adjusted based on the degree of renal impairment, and administered after hemodialysis on dialysis days.

Dosage adjustments for liver impairment are generally not required as the drug is not eliminated primarily through the liver.  The safety and effectiveness of Meropenem and Vaborbactam have not been established in children under 18 years of age.

### Side Effects

**Less common, but potentially serious side effects (frequency not defined or <1%):**

* *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea (a serious intestinal infection)
* Azotemia (increased nitrogenous waste in the blood)
* Chest discomfort

* Insomnia
* Lethargy
* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Oral candidiasis (yeast infection of the mouth)
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Meropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic that works by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.  It does this by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting the final step in peptidoglycan synthesis (a crucial component of bacterial cell walls). This disruption leads to bacterial cell lysis (rupture). Vaborbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.  It prevents certain types of bacteria from producing enzymes (beta-lactamases) that would otherwise break down and inactivate meropenem.  Therefore, Vaborbactam enhances and extends the effectiveness of Meropenem.

### Precautions
Meropenem and Vaborbactam is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to meropenem, vaborbactam, other carbapenems, beta-lactamase inhibitors, or any component of the formulation. It should also be avoided in patients with a history of anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Use with caution in patients with:

* Renal impairment (kidney problems)
* Central nervous system (CNS) disorders (such as brain lesions, history of seizures) or bacterial meningitis.


This medication may interact with other drugs.  Specifically, it's important to be aware of potential interactions with probenecid (which can increase Meropenem levels), valproate products (which may have reduced levels), and various vaccines (live attenuated vaccines may be less effective). Discuss all medications and supplements you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist.


Pregnancy Category is unknown.  Meropenem is excreted in breast milk, and the excretion of Vaborbactam is unknown.  Use caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
