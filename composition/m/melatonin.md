# Melatonin
### Generic Name
Melatonin

### Usage
Melatonin is primarily used for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia in patients aged 55 years and older.  It's a hormone naturally produced by the pineal gland, regulating the sleep-wake cycle. While its primary use focuses on insomnia, research is ongoing to explore its potential role in other sleep disorders and conditions.  It's crucial to remember that melatonin is not a cure for insomnia, but rather a short-term aid to help improve sleep.


### Dosage
**Adults (â‰¥55 years):** For insomnia, the recommended dosage is 2 mg orally once daily, 1-2 hours before bedtime. The maximum recommended duration of use is 13 weeks.

**Children:** Melatonin is not indicated for use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using melatonin if you have liver or kidney problems.

It is crucial to note that this is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Melatonin is derived from tryptophan, an amino acid.  It works by binding to melatonin receptor type 1A in the body.  This binding influences adenylate cyclase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway.  While the exact mechanisms by which it improves sleep are still being researched, its role in regulating the body's natural circadian rhythm is well-established.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Melatonin is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to melatonin or any component of the formulation.

**Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) depression when used with other CNS depressants.

**Use with Caution:** Melatonin should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Melatonin crosses the placenta and is not recommended during pregnancy.  It is excreted in breast milk, and breastfeeding is not recommended while using melatonin.
