# Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Pyridoxal- + L-Methyl Folate + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:** Methylcobalamin + Alpha-Lipoic Acid + Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate + L-Methylfolate + Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3)  *(Note:  There isn't a single generic name for this combination as it's a multi-vitamin/nutrient blend)*

**Usage:** This combination of nutrients is often used to support:

* **Nervous system health:** Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12), alpha-lipoic acid, and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (vitamin B6) play crucial roles in nerve function and myelination.  L-methylfolate (a form of folate/vitamin B9) also contributes to overall nerve health.
* **Energy production:** All these nutrients are involved in various metabolic pathways that produce energy.
* **Cognitive function:** Some research suggests potential benefits in cognitive function and memory.
* **Metabolic health:** Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that may improve insulin sensitivity.
* **Bone health:** Vitamin D3 is crucial for calcium absorption and bone health.

The specific usage depends on individual needs and should be determined by a healthcare professional. It's often used in individuals with suspected or diagnosed deficiencies in these vitamins, those with neurological conditions, or those aiming to improve overall health and well-being.


**Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated, but possible side effects can include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, diarrhea, or constipation. These are more common with higher doses.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible, particularly with sensitivities to any of the individual components.
* **Interactions with medications:** Can interact with certain medications (e.g., some blood thinners, metformin).  Always inform your doctor about all supplements you are taking.
* **Vitamin D toxicity:**  High doses of Vitamin D can lead to hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels).


**How it Works:**

* **Methylcobalamin:**  The active form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Alpha-Lipoic Acid:** A potent antioxidant that can regenerate other antioxidants (like vitamin C and E). It's also involved in glucose metabolism.
* **Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate:** The active form of vitamin B6, essential for many metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis.
* **L-Methylfolate:**  A bioavailable form of folate, involved in DNA synthesis, cell division, and neurotransmitter production.
* **Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3):** Important for calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and potentially other aspects of health.

The combination works synergistically, meaning the effects of each nutrient can enhance the others' effects.
