# Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Pyridoxal- + L-Methyl Folate + Vitamin D

**Generic Name:** Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate + L-Methylfolate + Vitamin D3

**Usage:**

This combination of nutrients is primarily used to support neurological health and overall well-being, particularly in conditions associated with deficiencies in these vitamins and cofactors.  Its components address several metabolic pathways crucial for nerve function, energy production, and immune response.

* **Primary Use:**  This combination is often used to address symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), particularly in individuals with diabetes. It may also be helpful in supporting cognitive function and potentially reducing oxidative stress.  Each component plays a unique role: Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) is essential for nerve function; alpha-lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant; pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (active form of vitamin B6) is involved in neurotransmitter synthesis; L-methylfolate (active form of folate, vitamin B9) is crucial for DNA synthesis and methylation reactions impacting neurological function; and vitamin D3 is vital for immune function and overall health, with some studies suggesting a role in neurological health.

* **Secondary Uses:** This combination may be used as a supportive therapy for conditions like age-related cognitive decline, certain types of anemia (though not a primary treatment), and to potentially improve energy levels. It's important to note that the evidence supporting these secondary uses is less robust than for its use in peripheral neuropathy.  Always consult a doctor before using this supplement for any condition.

**Dosage:**

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific product, individual needs, and the condition being treated. There is no universally standardized dosage.  It's crucial to follow the instructions on the specific product's label or as directed by a healthcare professional. Dosages are typically determined by a doctor based on individual assessment.  This is *not* a medication to self-prescribe.

**Forms:**  This combination is usually available in tablet or capsule form. Injectable forms exist for some individual components but are typically administered under medical supervision.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, constipation), flushing, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).  While rare, severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.
* **Note:**  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, stop taking the supplement and contact your healthcare provider immediately.

**How it Works:**

Each component in this combination works synergistically to support various bodily functions:

* **Methylcobalamin:**  Essential for myelin sheath formation (protecting nerve fibers) and nerve function.
* **Alpha-Lipoic Acid:**  A powerful antioxidant, combating oxidative stress that can damage nerves and cells.
* **Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate:**  Plays a key role in neurotransmitter production and metabolism.
* **L-Methylfolate:** Essential for DNA synthesis and methylation reactions vital for nervous system function.
* **Vitamin D3:** Supports immune function, and potentially has neuroprotective effects.


**Popular Brand Names (India):**  (Note:  Brand availability varies regionally.  This is not an exhaustive list.)
