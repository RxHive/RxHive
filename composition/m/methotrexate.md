# Methotrexate
### Generic Name
Methotrexate

### Usage

Methotrexate is a medication with a wide range of applications, primarily used as a cancer chemotherapy agent and an immunosuppressant.  Its main uses include:

* **Cancer Treatment:** Methotrexate is effective against various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), gestational trophoblastic neoplasms (such as choriocarcinoma and hydatidiform mole), breast cancer, head and neck cancer, certain types of lung cancer, and some lymphomas (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's).  It's often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs.  Specific regimens vary greatly depending on the type and stage of cancer.

* **Immunosuppression:**  Methotrexate acts as an immunosuppressant, reducing the activity of the immune system. This property makes it useful for treating autoimmune disorders such as:
    * **Severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  Used when other treatments haven't provided sufficient relief.
    * **Severe, recalcitrant psoriasis:**  Methotrexate helps manage the rapid skin cell growth characteristic of psoriasis.
    * **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA):** A form of arthritis affecting children.

While less common, Methotrexate also finds use in treating other conditions off-label, meaning its use isn't officially approved for these indications but is sometimes considered by healthcare professionals based on individual patient needs.  These off-label uses include certain inflammatory bowel diseases, some types of vasculitis, and certain scleroderma manifestations.  Always consult a healthcare professional for information on off-label use.

### Dosage

Methotrexate dosage is highly variable and entirely dependent on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, overall health, and the chosen treatment regimen.  There is no single "standard" dose.  Dosage can be administered orally, intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), or subcutaneously (SubQ).  Intrathecal administration (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid) is also used in certain cancer treatments.

**Examples of dosage ranges (NOT a complete list and should not be used for self-medication):**

* **Cancer:** Doses range from milligrams to grams per square meter of body surface area (mg/mÂ²) or per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg), usually administered over several hours or days.  Regimens typically involve multiple cycles of treatment. Leucovorin rescue is often used to reduce toxicity.

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:**  Oral doses usually start at 7.5-15 mg once weekly, potentially increasing gradually up to 30 mg weekly under medical supervision. SubQ and IM administration are also used.

* **Psoriasis:**  Oral doses typically begin at 7.5 -25 mg once weekly, potentially adjusted upwards as needed.  

**It's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist for accurate dosage instructions.**  Improper dosing can have serious consequences.


### Side Effects

Methotrexate can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity and frequency depending on the dosage and duration of treatment.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Mouth sores (stomatitis)
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Hair loss (alopecia)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bone marrow suppression (leading to low blood cell counts)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Lung damage (pneumonitis)
* Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Infections (due to immunosuppression)
* Neurotoxicity

**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.**

### How it Works

Methotrexate is a type of antimetabolite, a medication that interferes with the metabolic processes of cells, particularly those rapidly dividing.  In cancer treatment, it blocks the production of DNA and RNA, thereby inhibiting the growth and spread of cancer cells.

In autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, Methotrexate's mechanism of action is less fully understood but involves suppressing the immune system's activity, thereby reducing inflammation and the associated symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Methotrexate is a category X drug, meaning it's contraindicated during pregnancy due to a high risk of birth defects and fetal harm.  Women of childbearing age must use effective contraception during and after treatment.

* **Breastfeeding:** Methotrexate passes into breast milk and should not be used by breastfeeding mothers.

* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Methotrexate is eliminated primarily through the kidneys and liver.  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function require close monitoring and potentially dose adjustments to prevent toxic buildup.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking Methotrexate, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.

* **Other Medications:**  Many medications interact with Methotrexate.  Inform your doctor of all other medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Vaccinations:** Live vaccines should generally be avoided during Methotrexate therapy due to the risk of infection.


### FAQs

* **How long does it take to work?** The time it takes for Methotrexate to show effects varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the dosage.  For some cancers, effects may not be immediately noticeable.  In autoimmune diseases, it may take several weeks or months to see improvement.

* **How is it stored?**  Storage instructions vary based on the specific formulation (tablet, injection, etc.). Always follow the instructions provided by your pharmacist or doctor.

* **Can I drink alcohol while on Methotrexate?** No, excessive alcohol use should be avoided due to the increased risk of liver damage.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Do not double up on doses.  Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on how to proceed.

* **Can I stop taking Methotrexate if I feel better?**  No. Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding treatment duration and dosage.  Stopping abruptly can have consequences.
