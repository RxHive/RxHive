# Methotrexate

**Generic Name:** Methotrexate

**Usage:**

Methotrexate is used to treat several conditions, including:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis:**  To reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.
* **Psoriatic arthritis:** To treat joint pain, swelling, and stiffness associated with psoriasis.
* **Psoriasis:** To clear skin lesions and reduce scaling and inflammation.
* **Certain types of cancer:**  Including leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and others (often in combination with other chemotherapy drugs).
* **Ectopic pregnancy:**  In some cases, to terminate an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus).
* **Gestational trophoblastic disease:** A group of rare tumors that develop in the uterus after pregnancy.


**Side Effects:**

Methotrexate can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity depending on the dosage and individual patient.  Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Often mild and manageable with antiemetic medication.
* **Mouth sores (stomatitis):** Painful ulcers in the mouth.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can range from mild to severe.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling unusually tired.
* **Headache:**  Can range from mild to severe.
* **Hair loss (alopecia):**  Temporary hair thinning or loss.
* **Skin rash:**  Itching, redness, or other skin irritations.
* **Liver damage:**  Elevated liver enzymes are a possible sign.  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor liver function.
* **Kidney damage:**  Less common but possible, especially with high doses.
* **Bone marrow suppression:**  Decreased production of blood cells, leading to anemia, increased risk of infection, or easy bruising/bleeding.  This is a serious side effect requiring close monitoring.
* **Lung problems:**  In rare cases, methotrexate can cause lung inflammation (pneumonitis).
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Rare but can be life-threatening.


**How it Works:**

Methotrexate is a type of antimetabolite chemotherapy drug.  It works by interfering with the production of folic acid, a vitamin essential for cell growth and replication.  Because rapidly dividing cells (like cancer cells and some immune cells) require more folic acid, methotrexate inhibits their growth and proliferation.  In autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, it helps to suppress the overactive immune response.
