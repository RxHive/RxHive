# Morphine Sulfate Liposome
### Generic Name
Morphine Sulfate Liposome

### Usage
Morphine sulfate liposome is an extended-release injectable formulation specifically designed for epidural administration (in the lower back) to manage pain after major surgery.  Its primary use is to provide prolonged pain relief following significant surgical procedures. It is administered before surgery or after the umbilical cord is clamped during Cesarean sections. This medication is not intended for use in managing pain from other sources or via different administration routes.

### Dosage

**Adults:** The dosage varies depending on the type of surgery:

* **Major orthopedic surgery of the lower extremity:** 15 mg epidurally.
* **Lower abdominal or pelvic surgery:** 10-15 mg epidurally.
* **Cesarean section:** 10 mg epidurally.
* In some cases, a 20 mg dose may be considered, based on individual patient needs and physician assessment.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of morphine sulfate liposome in children under 18 have not been established.  Therefore, its use in this population is not recommended.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not currently provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for guidance in such cases.

### How it Works
Morphine is an opioid analgesic (painkiller) that primarily acts on mu-opioid receptors in the nervous system.  By binding to these receptors, it reduces the sensation of pain signals transmitted to the brain.  The liposomal formulation provides extended-release properties, offering longer-lasting pain relief compared to immediate-release morphine. Epidural administration delivers the medication directly to the spinal cord, providing targeted pain relief in the area affected by surgery.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Morphine sulfate liposome is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with:

* Known hypersensitivity (allergy) to morphine, morphine salts, or any component of the medication.
* Respiratory depression (slow or shallow breathing).
* Acute or severe bronchial asthma or upper airway obstruction.
* Existing or suspected paralytic ileus (bowel obstruction).
* Suspected or known head injury or increased intracranial pressure.
* Circulatory shock.


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of respiratory depression, misuse, abuse, and diversion of opiates.
* Increased risk of severe hypotension (low blood pressure).
* Increased risk of gastrointestinal obstruction.
* Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders, biliary tract disease (including acute pancreatitis), and elderly patients.
* Use cautiously when co-administered with other central nervous system depressants.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Morphine sulfate liposome is a Category C drug during pregnancy. It should not be used for vaginal labor and delivery. It is only administered during Cesarean sections, after the umbilical cord is clamped.  Morphine is excreted in breast milk; a decision regarding breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider during the first 48 hours after administration.
