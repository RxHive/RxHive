# Metyrosine
### Generic Name
Metyrosine (also known as Metirosine)

### Usage
Metyrosine is a medication primarily used for the short-term management of pheochromocytoma before surgery.  Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines (hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline), leading to high blood pressure and other serious symptoms.  Metyrosine helps to control these symptoms pre-operatively, making surgery safer.  It's also used for the long-term management of pheochromocytoma in cases where surgery isn't possible or for cases of chronic malignant pheochromocytoma.  It's important to note that metyrosine is *not* indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure not caused by a tumor).

### Dosage
Dosage is highly individualized and determined by a physician based on the patient's condition and response to treatment.  The information below is for general understanding and should not be interpreted as a prescription.

**Adults (Chronic Pheochromocytoma):**  Metyrosine is typically administered orally. The initial dose might be 250 mg four times a day (QID).  This can be increased, under careful medical supervision, to 250-500 mg per dose, up to a maximum of 4 grams per day divided into four doses. The usual maintenance dose is typically 2-3 grams per day, divided into doses given every 6 hours. For preoperative preparation, the effective dose should be given for at least 5-7 days before surgery.


**Children (Chronic Pheochromocytoma):**  The safety and efficacy of metyrosine in children under 12 years old have not been established.  For children 12 years and older, the dosage may be the same as for adults, but this must be determined and closely monitored by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A physician will adjust the dose as needed based on individual patient factors.

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Metyrosine works by inhibiting tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme that's crucial in the production of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine). By blocking this enzyme, metyrosine reduces the body's production of these hormones, thereby helping to control the high blood pressure and other symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma.  The reduction in catecholamine biosynthesis is typically between 35-80% in patients receiving recommended doses.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Metyrosine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to metyrosine or any of its components.

**Warnings:** Metyrosine can increase the risk of central nervous system (CNS) depression and crystalluria (crystals in the urine).  It should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Drug Interactions:**  Metyrosine can interact with various medications, including alcohol, antipsychotics, CNS depressants, droperidol, metoclopramide, promethazine, SSRIs, tetrabenazine, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). These interactions can potentially enhance the sedative effects or other adverse effects of these medications.  Careful monitoring is required when metyrosine is used concurrently with any of these drugs.  Consult your physician about potential interactions before starting metyrosine if you are taking other medications.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Metyrosine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution is advised if breastfeeding.


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take metyrosine with alcohol?** A: No, it's best to avoid alcohol while taking metyrosine, as it can increase its sedative effects.

**Q: How should I store metyrosine?** A: Store metyrosine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor; don't try to double up on doses.

**Q: Can metyrosine cure pheochromocytoma?** A: No, metyrosine manages the symptoms of pheochromocytoma, making it easier to undergo surgery and helping to manage the disease long-term when surgery is not an option. It doesn't cure the underlying tumor.

**Q:  How long will I need to take metyrosine?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual and the clinical situation. It could range from several days before surgery to long-term management, as directed by a physician.  The safety of long-term use has not been fully established.
