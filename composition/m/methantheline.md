# Methantheline
### Generic Name
Methantheline

### Usage
Methantheline is an anticholinergic drug primarily used as adjunctive therapy for peptic ulcers.  It works by reducing the spasms and secretions in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby helping to alleviate ulcer pain and promote healing.  It's also been used to treat other gastrointestinal disorders characterized by smooth muscle spasms, and in managing uninhibited hypertonic neurogenic bladder.  However, it's important to note that more potent and modern alternatives have largely replaced methantheline in current clinical practice.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated.  Generally, oral administration is standard.

* **Peptic Ulcer Disease:** The usual dose is 50-100 mg four times a day (QID).  A maintenance dose of 25-50 mg QID may be sufficient once the initial improvement is seen.

* **Gastrointestinal Disorders (with smooth muscle spasms):**  The typical dose is 50 mg three times a day (TID).

* **Uninhibited Hypertonic Neurogenic Bladder:**  The usual dose is 50-100 mg QID.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage in children is significantly lower and highly dependent on age and weight.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions closely.  Generally, oral administration is also standard for children.

* **Neonates (1 month old):**  Start with 12.5 mg twice a day (BID), then increase to 12.5 mg TID as tolerated.

* **Infants (1-12 months):** Start with 12.5 mg QID, gradually increasing to 25 mg QID if needed and tolerated.

* **Children (>1 year):**  12.5-50 mg QID, adjusted as needed based on the child's response and the doctor's recommendation.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Therefore, caution should be exercised when prescribing methantheline to patients with liver or kidney problems.  Close monitoring is essential.


### Side Effects

Methantheline, like other anticholinergic medications, can cause several side effects.  These can range from mild to severe.

* **Common:** Dry mouth (xerostomia), blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, dizziness, drowsiness, and palpitations.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Mental confusion,  hallucinations,  severe tachycardia,  increased intraocular pressure (especially in patients with glaucoma),  heat stroke (due to decreased sweating),  paralytic ileus (bowel obstruction), and allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly serious ones, immediately consult your doctor or seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Methantheline is an anticholinergic drug.  This means it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in many bodily functions, including muscle contractions and gland secretions. By blocking acetylcholine's effects at muscarinic receptors (a specific type of acetylcholine receptor), methantheline reduces smooth muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal tract and decreases the secretion of acids and other digestive juices. This action helps to alleviate the pain and promote healing in peptic ulcers and manage symptoms in other gastrointestinal conditions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methantheline is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or other anticholinergics; narrow-angle glaucoma; obstructive gastrointestinal disease; myasthenia gravis; paralytic ileus or intestinal atony; toxic megacolon or ulcerative colitis; obstructive uropathy; and unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage.

* **Interactions:**  Methantheline can interact with several other medications.  Antacids, kaolin, attapulgite, and ketoconazole may decrease its effectiveness. CNS depressants can enhance its CNS-depressant effects.  Other anticholinergics and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can potentiate its anticholinergic effects. Concurrent use with potassium chloride may increase gastrointestinal disturbances.

* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, those who have undergone ileostomy or colostomy, mild hepatic or renal disease, prostatic hypertrophy, tachyarrhythmia, or tachycardia.   Methantheline should be used with extreme caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus and infant.  Its use should be strictly weighed against potential benefits.

* **General Considerations:** Patients should be advised to avoid tasks requiring mental alertness (driving, operating machinery) due to potential drowsiness. They should also take precautions against overheating (avoid strenuous exercise in hot environments).


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take methantheline with other medications?** A: It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Methantheline can interact with other drugs.

* **Q: How should I store methantheline?** A: Store methantheline as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is methantheline habit-forming?** A: Methantheline is not considered habit-forming.

* **Q: Can I stop taking methantheline suddenly?** A:  It's best to consult your doctor before stopping methantheline, as sudden cessation might lead to withdrawal symptoms or exacerbation of underlying conditions.
