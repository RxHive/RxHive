# Minoxidil + Aminexil
### Generic Name
Minoxidil + Aminexil


### Usage

Minoxidil and Aminexil are frequently combined in topical formulations for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern hair loss).  This combination targets hair loss from two different angles. Minoxidil is a vasodilator that increases blood flow to the hair follicles, stimulating hair growth. Aminexil, a derivative of aminoxyl, helps prevent hair follicle miniaturization and premature shedding by inhibiting collagen production around the hair follicle.  While primarily used for hair loss, it's crucial to understand that this combination doesn't address all types of hair loss.  It's most effective for those experiencing thinning hair or early stages of pattern baldness.  The combination therapy aims to improve hair density and thickness, and potentially reduce further hair loss.  It's not a cure for baldness and its effectiveness varies between individuals.

### Dosage

Dosage instructions always come directly from your physician or pharmacist and should be strictly followed. Self-medication is strongly discouraged. However, general guidelines for topical application usually involve:

* **Adults:**  A specific amount of the solution or lotion (as prescribed) is typically applied directly to the scalp twice daily in the affected areas.  Precise application instructions will be provided with the prescription.
* **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for use in children, as its safety and effectiveness in this age group have not been established.
* **Oral Administration:** Minoxidil is available orally for certain hypertension treatments, but the combination with Aminexil is exclusively topical.  Oral minoxidil is not relevant for hair loss.
* **IV Administration:**  Neither minoxidil nor Aminexil are administered intravenously for hair loss treatment.


**Important Note:**  Always follow the specific instructions provided on your prescription label or by your healthcare provider. The dosage and application method may vary depending on the formulation and individual needs.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Scalp irritation (itching, burning, redness), dryness, flaking, unwanted hair growth on the face or other body areas (especially in women).
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Chest pain, rapid or irregular heartbeat, dizziness, swelling in the hands, feet, or ankles (indicating fluid retention), weight gain.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  Rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the more serious ones, discontinue use immediately and seek medical attention.


### How it Works

Minoxidil's mechanism involves vasodilation, widening blood vessels to improve blood flow to the hair follicles. This increased blood supply provides the follicles with more nutrients and oxygen, stimulating hair growth and prolonging the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle. Aminexil works by interfering with the production of collagen around the hair follicle.  This prevents the collagen sheath from tightening and causing the hair follicle to miniaturize, ultimately leading to hair loss.  The combination action makes the treatment more comprehensive than either drug alone.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This combination should not be used by individuals allergic to minoxidil or Aminexil, or those with certain cardiovascular conditions.  Consult a doctor before use if you have heart problems, high or low blood pressure, kidney disease, or thyroid problems.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements. Interactions with other medications are possible.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor.  The safety of topical application during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been fully established.
* **Other Precautions:** Avoid getting the solution in your eyes or mouth. Wash your hands after application. Avoid using other hair products on the treated area simultaneously without consulting your doctor.
