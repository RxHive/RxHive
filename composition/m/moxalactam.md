# Moxalactam
### Generic Name
Moxalactam (also known as Latamoxef)

### Usage
Moxalactam is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  It's particularly potent against *Enterobacteriaceae* and resists breakdown by beta-lactamases (enzymes that some bacteria produce to inactivate antibiotics).  This antibiotic was used to treat various infections, including:

* **Bone and joint infections:**  Infections affecting bones and joints.
* **Gastrointestinal (GI) infections:** Infections of the digestive system.
* **Gynecological infections:** Infections of the female reproductive organs.
* **Meningitis:** Inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
* **Respiratory tract infections:** Infections affecting the lungs, bronchi, and trachea.
* **Septicemia (sepsis):** A life-threatening condition caused by the body's overwhelming response to infection.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** Infections affecting the skin and underlying tissues.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Infections affecting the urinary system.


**Important Note:** Moxalactam is no longer available in the United States.

### Dosage

Dosage information provided here is for historical reference only, as the drug is no longer available.  **Do not attempt to obtain or use this medication without a prescription and guidance from a healthcare professional.**

* **Adults:**
    * **Intramuscular (IM):** 2 grams per day in two divided doses.
    * **Intravenous (IV):** 2-6 grams per day in 2-3 divided doses.
* **Children:**
    * **IM/IV:** 50-100 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses for most infections.
    * **Meningitis (IV):** Loading dose: 100 mg/kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments were needed based on renal function.  Specific guidelines existed for individuals with varying creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels.  No specific adjustments were recommended for hepatic impairment.  These adjustments are crucial and should only be determined by a healthcare professional, making this information purely historical.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Pain at the injection site, diarrhea, fever.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypoprothrombinemia (low levels of clotting factor), serious bleeding episodes, eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell), leucopenia (low white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).  These effects highlight the potential for bleeding complications associated with Moxalactam.


**If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Moxalactam is a bactericidal antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, specifically interfering with the cross-linking of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of bacterial cell walls. This disruption weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis (breakdown) and bacterial death.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity (allergy) to moxalactam or related components.
* **Warnings:** Use with extreme caution in patients with coagulation abnormalities (bleeding disorders) or a history of penicillin allergy, due to the increased risk of bleeding.
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with warfarin or heparin increases bleeding risk.  Concurrent use with alcohol may cause a disulfiram-like reaction (similar to Antabuse).  Live cholera and typhoid vaccines may have reduced efficacy if given concurrently.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Moxalactam is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus haven't been fully excluded. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, warranting cautious use during breastfeeding.
