# Melphalan Flufenamide
### Generic Name
Melphalan Flufenamide

**Important Note:**  Melphalan flufenamide was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer in October 2021 due to an increased risk of death observed in clinical trials.  This information is provided for historical and educational purposes only.  **It should not be used as a guide for current treatment.**  Consult your healthcare provider for appropriate treatment options for multiple myeloma.


### Usage

Melphalan flufenamide, when it was available, was used in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.  This means it was intended for patients whose multiple myeloma had returned after treatment (relapsed) or had not responded to previous treatments (refractory).  Specifically, it was used in patients who had received at least four prior lines of therapy and whose disease was resistant to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one CD38-directed monoclonal antibody.  Essentially, it was a treatment option for patients with very advanced and treatment-resistant multiple myeloma.


### Dosage

Because Melphalan flufenamide is no longer available, specific dosage information is not relevant for current medical practice.  Dosage information from the period when it was available was determined by a physician based on individual patient factors and always administered in conjunction with dexamethasone.


### Side Effects

Since Melphalan flufenamide is no longer available, a comprehensive list of side effects is not practically useful. However, it's important to remember that alkylating agents like Melphalan flufenamide can cause a range of side effects, some common and some less frequent but serious.  These could include, but were not limited to:

*   **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, mouth sores.
*   **Serious (but less common):**  Severe infections, bleeding problems, kidney damage, nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), low blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia),  heart problems.

**It is crucial to report any adverse effects to your doctor immediately.**

### How it Works

Melphalan flufenamide is a type of alkylating agent. It works by damaging the DNA of rapidly dividing cancer cells, particularly multiple myeloma cells, ultimately leading to their death.  The drug is a peptide-conjugated form of melphalan, meaning it's attached to a peptide that helps it get into the cancer cells more effectively. Once inside, it's broken down to release melphalan, which then exerts its cytotoxic (cell-killing) effects.


### Precautions

Since the drug is no longer available,  detailed precautions are not applicable to current medical practice. However, generally, alkylating agents like Melphalan flufenamide carry significant risks, including those already mentioned.  Additional precautions would have included careful monitoring of blood counts and kidney function.  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding would have been contraindicated.


### FAQs

**Q: Why was Melphalan flufenamide withdrawn from the market?**
