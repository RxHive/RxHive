# Metoclopramide + Simethicone
### Generic Name
Metoclopramide + Simethicone

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with gastrointestinal distress, specifically those involving nausea, vomiting, bloating, and gas.  Metoclopramide works by increasing the movement of food through the digestive tract (gastric motility), while simethicone helps to break down gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, reducing bloating and discomfort.  This combination is often prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Functional dyspepsia:** A common disorder characterized by upper abdominal discomfort and various digestive symptoms.
* **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):** While not a first-line treatment, it may be used to relieve associated nausea and vomiting.
* **Postoperative nausea and vomiting:** To help manage nausea and vomiting after surgery.
* **Diabetic gastroparesis:** A condition where delayed stomach emptying causes nausea, vomiting, and bloating.  (Note: this requires careful monitoring and is typically not the sole treatment.)

It's crucial to understand that this medication treats *symptoms*, not the underlying cause of the gastrointestinal problem.  If the underlying condition isn't addressed, symptoms may persist even with this medication.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation, the patient's age, weight, and the severity of their symptoms. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  There is no standard IV formulation of this combination drug; metoclopramide and simethicone are typically administered orally.

**Oral:**  Dosage instructions will be found on the product label and should be carefully followed.  Typically, the medication is taken before meals and at bedtime.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on individual needs.  Children's dosages are determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician, considering age and weight.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Dry mouth
* Restlessness or anxiety
* Fatigue

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, especially of the face and tongue – can be permanent) – more likely with long-term use.
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (muscle spasms, tremors, rigidity) – more likely with higher doses.
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)


**If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Metoclopramide enhances the movement of food through the digestive system by increasing the contractions of the stomach and intestines.  This helps to speed up the emptying of the stomach and reduce nausea and vomiting.  Simethicone works by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the digestive tract, allowing these bubbles to coalesce into larger bubbles that are more easily expelled through belching or flatulence. This helps to relieve bloating and gas.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with certain conditions, including pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), certain bowel obstructions, or known hypersensitivity to metoclopramide or simethicone.
* **Drug Interactions:** Metoclopramide can interact with several other medications, including some antidepressants, anticoagulants, and certain antibiotics. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Children:** Use in children should be carefully considered and only under the guidance of a pediatrician.
