# Magnesium Aspartate
### Generic Name
Magnesium Aspartate

### Usage

Magnesium aspartate is primarily used to treat and prevent hypomagnesemia, a condition characterized by low levels of magnesium in the blood.  Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions within the body, impacting everything from muscle and nerve function to blood sugar control and blood pressure regulation.  Therefore, maintaining adequate magnesium levels is crucial for overall health. While not a primary use, magnesium aspartate may also be considered a supplemental source of magnesium for individuals who do not get enough from their diet, particularly those with increased magnesium requirements (e.g., pregnant or breastfeeding women, athletes).  However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine the need for supplementation and appropriate dosage.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the individual's age, health status, and the reason for magnesium supplementation.  Always follow your doctor's prescription or the instructions provided by a qualified healthcare professional.  The following information is for general understanding and should not be used for self-medication.

**Adults:**

* **Dietary Reference Intake (RDA):**  The recommended daily intake of elemental magnesium varies with age and sex, ranging from approximately 310-420 mg/day for adults. Pregnant and lactating women have higher requirements.  
* **Hypomagnesemia Treatment:**  The dosage for treating hypomagnesemia will be determined by a doctor based on the severity of the deficiency and may involve significantly higher doses than the RDA. These are typically administered orally, either as tablets or packets of powder, with dosages varying widely depending on the specific product and individual patient needs. Your doctor will monitor your magnesium levels to ensure that the dosage is effective.

**Children:**

* **Dietary Reference Intake (RDA):**  Similar to adults, the RDA for children varies with age.  It's considerably lower than adult requirements.
* **Hypomagnesemia Treatment:**  Dosage in children for treating hypomagnesemia will be determined by their physician and will be considerably lower than adult doses, carefully adjusted based on age and weight to avoid potential side effects.  The medication might be available as a liquid syrup or tablets, again tailored to the child's age and the doctor's recommendations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised in individuals with kidney problems, as magnesium is primarily excreted through the kidneys.  Accumulation can lead to toxicity.  In severe renal impairment, magnesium aspartate is contraindicated.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  There are currently no dosage adjustments specifically recommended for individuals with liver impairment based on the manufacturer's labeling.



### Side Effects

Common side effects, typically associated with higher doses, can include:

* Abdominal cramps
* Diarrhea
* Flatulence (gas)
* Nausea

Less common but potentially serious side effects may include:

* Fatigue
* Loose stools


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, it's essential to contact your doctor or other qualified healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Magnesium aspartate works by providing a readily absorbable form of magnesium to the body. Magnesium is a crucial cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions, playing a vital role in various metabolic processes.  It helps maintain proper muscle and nerve function, supports healthy blood sugar levels, contributes to normal blood pressure, and is involved in protein synthesis. By replenishing magnesium levels, magnesium aspartate helps alleviate the symptoms and address the underlying cause of hypomagnesemia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Magnesium aspartate is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication, severe renal impairment, and certain cardiac conduction disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:** Magnesium can interact with various medications, including some antibiotics, bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers, and others.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe, the dosage during pregnancy and lactation should be carefully determined by a healthcare professional to meet increased requirements without exceeding safe limits.  Magnesium is distributed into breast milk.
* **Other Precautions:** Exercise caution if you have neuromuscular disease or hypermagnesemia (already high magnesium levels).


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take magnesium aspartate without a doctor's prescription?**  A: While available over-the-counter in some regions as a dietary supplement,  it's always advisable to consult a doctor or other qualified healthcare professional before starting magnesium supplementation, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking other medications.  Self-treating hypomagnesemia can be dangerous.
* **Q: How should I store magnesium aspartate?**  A: Store it as directed on the product label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one. Simply take the next dose as scheduled.
* **Q: Are there any dietary sources of magnesium?** A: Yes, many foods are rich in magnesium, including whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and dark leafy green vegetables.  A balanced diet can often help maintain adequate magnesium levels.
