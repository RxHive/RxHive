# Meloxicam
### Generic Name
Meloxicam

### Usage
Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used in adults to manage moderate to severe pain.  This can be used alone or in combination with other pain relievers that aren't NSAIDs.  It's also commonly prescribed for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis to reduce pain and inflammation in the affected joints.  While not its primary indication, meloxicam may be used off-label to treat acute gout flares.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Different formulations of oral meloxicam (e.g., 5mg vs 7.5mg capsules) are not always interchangeable, even if the milligram strength appears similar.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions carefully.  Do not substitute doses without consulting your healthcare provider.

**Adults:**

* **Pain (moderate to severe):** Intravenous (IV) administration: 30mg once daily.  Use for the shortest duration possible based on individual needs.  May be used alone or with other non-NSAID analgesics.
* **Osteoarthritis:** Oral:  Initial dose is 5mg or 7.5mg once daily.  Some patients may benefit from an increase to 10mg (capsule) or 15mg (capsule/tablet/suspension/ODT) daily. The maximum daily dose is 10mg (for 5mg/10mg capsules) or 15mg (for 7.5mg/15mg capsules/tablets/suspension/ODT).
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Oral: Initial dose is 7.5mg once daily.  Some patients may benefit from an increase to 15mg daily.  The maximum daily dose is 15mg.
* **Acute Gout Flares (off-label):** Oral: 15mg once daily. Start within 24-48 hours of the flare's onset, ideally.  Discontinue 2-3 days after symptoms subside; usual duration is 5-7 days.

**Children:**

* **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA):** Oral (suspension/tablets): 0.125 mg/kg once daily.  The maximum daily dose is 7.5mg. Children and adolescents weighing 60kg or more may take 7.5mg orally disintegrating tablets once daily.  **IV administration is contraindicated in children.**

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney impairment.  Always consult a doctor before adjusting the dose.  Meloxicam is not recommended for individuals with severe kidney impairment.

### How it Works

Meloxicam belongs to a class of drugs called NSAIDs.  It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, meloxicam helps to alleviate pain and reduce swelling in joints and other tissues.  While it also blocks COX-1, meloxicam preferentially inhibits COX-2.  This selectivity aims to reduce the severity of gastrointestinal side effects compared to nonselective NSAIDs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Meloxicam should not be used by people allergic to meloxicam or other NSAIDs, those with a history of asthma or allergic reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, individuals with active peptic ulcers or bleeding, severe liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled heart failure, or known hyperkalemia.  It is also contraindicated in pregnant women during the third trimester and breastfeeding women.
* **Interactions:** Meloxicam can interact with many other medications, including blood thinners, diuretics, and some other pain relievers.  Inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Meloxicam carries a risk of serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events, including heart attack, stroke, ulcers, bleeding, and perforation.   Elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions are at higher risk.  Meloxicam should be used with caution in patients with high blood pressure, fluid retention (edema), or liver/kidney impairment.  Regular monitoring may be necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during the third trimester of pregnancy is contraindicated due to the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.  The safety of meloxicam during breastfeeding is not established.
