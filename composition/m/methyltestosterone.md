# Methyltestosterone
### Generic Name
Methyltestosterone

### Usage

Methyltestosterone is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid primarily used to treat testosterone deficiency in adult males.  This deficiency, also known as hypogonadism, can result in symptoms like reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle mass, and fatigue.  Methyltestosterone can help restore normal testosterone levels and alleviate these symptoms.

Beyond its primary use, methyltestosterone has also been used in the treatment of certain types of breast cancer in women, specifically in postmenopausal women with inoperable metastatic mammary cancer (cancer that has spread to the bones) and in premenopausal women who have undergone oophorectomy (removal of ovaries) and have hormone-responsive tumors.  It's important to note that its use in breast cancer is less common now due to the availability of other, potentially less risky treatment options.  In some cases, it may also be used to treat postpartum breast pain and engorgement, although this is an off-label use.  Finally, in children, it can be used to induce pubertal changes in males with hypogonadism.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and the form of the medication (oral or buccal). It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following represents a summary of typical dosages and should not be considered medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Androgen deficiency (males):** Oral: 10-50 mg/day; Buccal: 5-25 mg/day.
* **Hypogonadism, climacteric, and impotence (males):** Oral: 10-40 mg/day.
* **Post-pubertal cryptorchidism (males):** Oral: 30 mg/day.
* **Inoperable breast carcinoma (females):** Oral: 50-200 mg/day; Buccal: 25-100 mg/day.
* **Postpartum breast pain and engorgement (females):** Oral: 80 mg/day for 3-5 days postpartum; Buccal: 40 mg/day for 3-5 days.


**Children:**

* **Induction of pubertal changes in hypogonadal males:** Oral: 10 mg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment. However, if abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) or cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice occur, the medication should be discontinued.

### Side Effects

Methyltestosterone, like other anabolic-androgenic steroids, can cause a range of side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Acne
* Changes in libido
* Hair loss (androgenetic alopecia)
* Fluid retention (edema)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Headaches
* Anxiety or depression

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Liver damage (including jaundice, hepatitis, and potentially liver tumors)
* Increased risk of blood clots
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)
* Virilisation in females (development of male characteristics)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels)
* Prostate cancer (in males)
* Changes in cholesterol levels
* Polycythemia (increased red blood cell count)

If any side effects occur, particularly those listed as serious, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Methyltestosterone is a synthetic form of testosterone. It works by binding to androgen receptors in various tissues and organs throughout the body. This binding initiates a cascade of cellular events that promote the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics, muscle growth (anabolic effects), and the stimulation of sexual function (androgenic effects).  In breast cancer, it can affect tumor growth by interfering with hormone-dependent pathways.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methyltestosterone is contraindicated in men with prostate cancer or breast cancer, and in women who are pregnant or may become pregnant.  It is also contraindicated in men with age-related hypogonadism.
* **Drug Interactions:** Methyltestosterone can interact with various medications, including corticosteroids, blood glucose-lowering agents, and anticoagulants.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies being taken.
* **Warnings:**  Methyltestosterone carries a significant risk of serious side effects, especially with long-term use or high doses.  Close monitoring of liver function, blood counts, and lipid levels is essential.  Patients with pre-existing heart conditions or a history of blood clots should use caution.  Prepubertal children should be closely monitored for premature bone maturation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Methyltestosterone is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it is contraindicated during pregnancy. Its use during breastfeeding is also discouraged due to the potential for harm to the nursing infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Methyltestosterone suddenly?**  A: No, it's important to gradually reduce the dose under the guidance of a doctor to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store Methyltestosterone?** A: Store Methyltestosterone at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, and keep it out of the reach of children.

* **Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with Methyltestosterone use?** A: Yes, long-term use can increase the risk of serious side effects, including liver damage, blood clots, and certain cancers.  Regular monitoring is crucial.
