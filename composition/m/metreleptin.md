# Metreleptin
### Generic Name
Metreleptin

### Usage
Metreleptin is a prescription medication used as replacement therapy for the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.  Lipodystrophy is a condition characterized by an abnormal distribution of body fat.  Metreleptin helps to address the metabolic and endocrine abnormalities associated with this deficiency, improving associated conditions.  It's crucial to understand that Metreleptin is *not* a treatment for general obesity.


### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage is highly individualized and determined by a healthcare professional based on factors including the patient's weight, response to treatment, and presence of any adverse effects. The following information provides general guidelines only.

**Adults (Lipodystrophy):** Metreleptin is administered subcutaneously (under the skin).

* **Patients with baseline weight ≤ 40 kg:** The initial dose is typically 0.06 mg/kg once daily.  The dose may be increased or decreased by 0.02 mg/kg/day as needed, with a maximum dose of 0.13 mg/kg/day.
* **Patients with baseline weight > 40 kg:** The initial dose is typically 2.5 mg once daily for males and 5 mg once daily for females. The dose may be adjusted by 1.25-2.5 mg/day as needed, with a maximum dose of 10 mg/day.

**Children and Adolescents (Lipodystrophy):** The dosage is the same as for adults, adjusted according to weight.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  However, close monitoring is crucial in these patient populations.

**Discontinuation:** If discontinuation is necessary, especially in patients with risk factors for pancreatitis (like a history of pancreatitis or severe hypertriglyceridemia), the dose should be tapered over one week while closely monitoring triglyceride levels.  Lipid-lowering medications may need to be adjusted.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
* Weight loss
* Development of antibodies against metreleptin

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients or less frequently):**

* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)  — Seek immediate medical attention if experienced.
* Urticaria (hives) at the injection site
* Ovarian cysts
* Proteinuria (protein in the urine)
* Anemia
* Erythema (redness) at the injection site
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Back pain
* Otic infections (ear infections)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Fever

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
* Autoimmune hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (kidney disease)
* T-cell lymphoma


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Metreleptin is a recombinant human leptin analog.  Leptin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and metabolism. In individuals with leptin deficiency, Metreleptin binds to and activates the leptin receptor (Ob-R) in the body. This activation helps to restore normal metabolic and endocrine function, improving the complications associated with lipodystrophy.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Metreleptin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to Metreleptin or any of its components and in patients with general obesity not related to congenital leptin deficiency.

**Warnings:**

* **Antibody Development:**  Neutralizing antibodies against Metreleptin can develop, potentially reducing the drug's effectiveness and leading to severe infections or worsening metabolic control.  Regular monitoring is necessary.
* **Lymphomas:**  There have been reports of T-cell lymphoma in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy, both treated and untreated with Metreleptin.  The risk-benefit ratio should be carefully considered in these patients.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Metreleptin is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been fully established.  It's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits with a healthcare provider. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Interactions:** Concomitant use with insulin or insulin secretagogues increases the risk of hypoglycemia.
* **Neonates:** Products containing benzyl alcohol should be avoided in neonates due to the risk of gasping syndrome.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Metreleptin administered?**
A: Metreleptin is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily. Injection sites should be rotated.

**Q: How long will it take to see results?**
A: The time to see results varies depending on the individual and the severity of their condition.

**Q: How should Metreleptin be stored?**
A:  Store Metreleptin according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Typically, this involves refrigeration.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Contact your doctor for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double up on doses.

**Q: Is Metreleptin a cure for lipodystrophy?**
A: Metreleptin is a replacement therapy that helps manage the complications of leptin deficiency associated with lipodystrophy. It is not a cure.

**Q: Can I take other medications with Metreleptin?**
A:  Always inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.  Some medications may interact with Metreleptin.
