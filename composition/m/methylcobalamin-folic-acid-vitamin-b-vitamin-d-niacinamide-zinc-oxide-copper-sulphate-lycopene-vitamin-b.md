# Methylcobalamin + Folic Acid + Vitamin B + Vitamin D + Niacinamide + Zinc Oxide + Copper Sulphate + Lycopene + Vitamin B

It's impossible to provide detailed information on a supplement with the generic description "Methylcobalamin + Folic Acid + Vitamin B + Vitamin D + Niacinamide + Zinc Oxide + Copper Sulphate + Lycopene + Vitamin B" because it's too vague.  The "Vitamin B" is repeated and unspecified, leaving out crucial details on the specific B vitamins included (B1, B2, B6, B12 etc.), their dosages, and the amount of each ingredient.  This lack of specificity makes it impossible to accurately describe its usage, side effects, and mechanism of action.

To give you a helpful response, I need the specific quantities of each ingredient.  For example, instead of "Vitamin B," it should list "Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) 50mg," etc. for each component.

However, I can offer general information based on the individual components *assuming typical supplement dosages are used.*  **This is not a substitute for medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any new supplement.**
