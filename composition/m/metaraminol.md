# Metaraminol
### Generic Name
Metaraminol

### Usage
Metaraminol bitartrate is a medication primarily used to treat and prevent dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension).  Its primary application is in managing hypotension that occurs as a complication of spinal anesthesia.  It's also used as an adjunct treatment for hypotension caused by various factors, including hemorrhage (severe bleeding), certain medications, surgical complications, septicemia (blood poisoning), cardiogenic shock (heart failure causing low blood pressure), and brain damage resulting from shock due to tumors or trauma.  Essentially, it's used in situations where the body's blood pressure has dropped significantly and needs a boost to maintain adequate blood flow to vital organs.

### Dosage
Metaraminol is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage is highly variable and must be carefully adjusted based on the individual's response and tolerance.  There isn't a standardized dosage, instead it is titrated carefully.

**Adults:**

* **Emergency Hypotension:**  An initial IV bolus of 0.5–5 mg may be given, followed by a continuous infusion if needed. The continuous infusion typically uses a concentration of 15–100 mg in 500 mL of fluid, with the rate adjusted as needed.  An alternative approach involves an initial bolus of 0.5 mg or 0.01 mg/kg, followed by an infusion if necessary.  The infusion rate in this case would range from 2–15 mg/hour or 0.025–0.1 mg/kg/hour.

* **Non-Emergency Hypotension:** A continuous IV infusion (15–100 mg in 500 mL) might be started without an initial bolus, adjusting the rate based on the patient's response.

**Children (≥12 years):**

Dosage guidelines for children 12 years and older largely mirror adult guidelines for emergency and non-emergency hypotension situations.  Always consult a physician for appropriate pediatric dosing.  Use in children under 12 years of age is contraindicated for this particular formulation.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
Common Side Effects:

* Headache
* High blood pressure (hypertension)

Less Common but Serious Side Effects:

* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
* Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeats)
* Peripheral ischemia (reduced blood flow to extremities)
* Sinus tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Ventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeats originating in the ventricles)
* Ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats originating in the ventricles)
* Nausea
* Abscess formation, skin exfoliation and tissue necrosis (rare, post-marketing reports)

**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works
Metaraminol is a pure alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist. This means it directly stimulates alpha-1 receptors located on blood vessels, causing them to constrict.  This constriction reduces the diameter of blood vessels, increasing blood pressure.  It's believed that this effect is partly mediated by the inhibition of adenyl cyclase, an enzyme involved in the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP).  Additionally, Metaraminol indirectly releases norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that further contributes to vasoconstriction and blood pressure elevation.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Metaraminol, sulfites, or any formulation component.
* Concomitant use with cyclopropane or halothane anesthesia (unless absolutely necessary).
* Children under 12 years of age (product specific).

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with heart disease, cirrhosis, diabetes, pre-existing hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, asthma, and in breastfeeding women and the elderly.
* Metaraminol may increase the risk of arrhythmias.
* Extravasation (leakage from the IV site) can cause local tissue damage; immediate action is necessary if this occurs.
* There is a potential for a cumulative effect leading to prolonged hypertension.
* May provoke relapse in patients with a history of malaria.

**Drug Interactions:**  Use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can significantly potentiate Metaraminol's effects.  Use with digitalis can increase the risk of arrhythmias.  The combination of Metaraminol and cyclopropane or halothane anesthetic agents should be avoided unless clinically unavoidable.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Metaraminol stored?**  A:  Storage guidelines should be found on the product label. Generally, it needs to be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the administration route and dosage; however, effects can be observed relatively quickly.

* **Q: Can I take Metaraminol with other medications?** A:  It is crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, herbs, and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  Certain combinations, especially with MAOIs, TCAs, or digitalis, can be risky.

* **Q: Is Metaraminol safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: Metaraminol is a Category C pregnancy drug, indicating potential risks to the fetus. It is used with caution during Cesarean sections, but alternatives are often preferred. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so use should be approached cautiously.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Metaraminol is typically given in a hospital setting under close medical supervision.  If you have questions about missed doses or treatment, it's important to contact your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q:  What if Metaraminol leaks out of the IV line?** A:  If extravasation occurs, stop the infusion immediately, follow the directions provided by your healthcare professional (this often involves aspiration, removal of the needle, elevation of the limb, and application of cold compresses), and seek medical attention.  Local injection of an antidote such as phentolamine may be given as well.
