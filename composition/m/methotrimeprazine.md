# Methotrimeprazine
### Generic Name
Methotrimeprazine (also known as levomepromazine)

### Usage
Methotrimeprazine is a first-generation antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat a range of conditions characterized by anxiety, tension, and insomnia.  Its sedative properties make it useful for managing nausea and vomiting.  It's also employed as a pain reliever, particularly for neuralgia and cancer pain, and can be used as an adjunct to general anesthesia (both before and after surgery).  Beyond these primary uses, methotrimeprazine finds application in managing more serious mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, senile psychosis, and manic-depressive syndromes.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's specific instructions.

* **Oral:** For mild conditions (anxiety, tension, mild insomnia, mild nausea/vomiting), initial doses typically range from 6-25 mg per day, divided into three doses with meals.  Doses can be adjusted as needed. For severe conditions (psychosis, severe pain, severe insomnia), much higher initial doses (50-75 mg/day or even higher) may be necessary, divided into two or three doses. In some cases of severe psychosis, daily doses exceeding 1 gram might be required.  Always follow medical advice closely, as these higher doses may cause excessive drowsiness initially.

* **Intramuscular (IM):**  Generally, 75-100 mg/day is administered in three to four divided doses. For postoperative pain management, lower doses (10-25 mg every 8 hours) are typically used.  If opioids are co-administered, the opioid dose should be reduced.

* **Subcutaneous (SubQ):** This route is off-label; however, both bolus injections and continuous infusion are used in some settings. The dosage in this case varies greatly depending on individual need and clinical context.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Methotrimeprazine use in children and adolescents is generally reserved for serious conditions. Dosage is carefully calculated based on the child's weight. Oral doses typically begin at 0.25 mg/kg/day, divided into two to three doses, with a maximum daily dose of 40 mg for children under 12. Intramuscular administration in children starts at 0.0625â€“0.125 mg/kg/day,  divided as needed.  Intravenous use (IV) in children is only used in palliative care, and always at a rate specifically determined and closely monitored by a medical professional.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Methotrimeprazine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic (liver) impairment.  While there are no specific dosage adjustments for renal (kidney) impairment, the medication should be used cautiously in patients with kidney issues.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing)

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Extrapyramidal symptoms (muscle stiffness, tremors, involuntary movements)
* Tardive dyskinesia (late-onset involuntary movements, often irreversible)
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status)
* Prolonged QT interval (an abnormality on the electrocardiogram, potentially leading to serious heart rhythm problems)
* Agranulocytosis (severe decrease in white blood cells, increasing the risk of infection)
* Allergic reactions (skin rash, hives, swelling)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)

**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Methotrimeprazine is an aliphatic phenothiazine derivative. Its primary mechanism of action involves blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in various functions, including movement, mood, and thought processes. By blocking dopamine, methotrimeprazine can reduce symptoms of psychosis, anxiety, and improve sleep. It also acts on other receptors in the brain (serotonin, alpha-adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors), contributing to its sedative and analgesic effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Methotrimeprazine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or other phenothiazines, hepatic impairment, severe blood disorders, coma, or CNS depression from other substances, closed-angle glaucoma, and urinary retention.  It should also be avoided in patients with a history of agranulocytosis or those concurrently taking dopaminergic medications.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Methotrimeprazine can interact with other medications, such as CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, sedatives), increasing their sedative effects.  It may also interact with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme system, potentially increasing their blood levels.  Concurrent use with other drugs prolonging the QT interval can increase the risk of dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities.

* **Specific Populations:**  Methotrimeprazine should be used cautiously in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and older adults.  Its use in pregnancy is only justified in exceptional circumstances, with careful consideration of the potential benefits against the risks to the fetus.  It is excreted in breast milk and is usually avoided in nursing mothers.  In older adults, particularly those with dementia, there's an increased risk of death.

* **Warnings:**  Patients should be monitored for the development of extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and other serious side effects.  Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating machinery due to potential drowsiness.  Patients should avoid alcohol consumption while taking methotrimeprazine.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for methotrimeprazine to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration and the condition being treated.  For insomnia, effects may be seen within an hour or two of taking an oral dose.  For other conditions, the therapeutic effect may take longer to develop.

* **Q: Can I stop taking methotrimeprazine suddenly?** A: No.  Abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult with your doctor before stopping treatment.  The medication should be gradually tapered off under medical supervision.

* **Q: How should I store methotrimeprazine?** A: Store at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Is methotrimeprazine addictive?** A:  Physical dependence can occur with prolonged use, highlighting the need for gradual tapering under medical supervision. Psychological dependence is less likely.
