# Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) Vaccine
### Generic Name
Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine

### Usage
The MMR vaccine is a combination vaccine protecting against three viral illnesses: measles, mumps, and rubella.  Its primary use is routine immunization of children and adolescents to prevent these highly contagious diseases.  Secondary uses include vaccination of adults who lack evidence of immunity, are at high risk of exposure (healthcare workers, international travelers), or are experiencing outbreaks in their communities.  The vaccine is crucial for public health, aiming to eliminate these diseases.

### Dosage
**Pediatric Dosage (Children ≥12 months):**  The standard schedule involves two 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SubQ) injections. The first dose is given at 12-15 months of age, and the second dose is administered at 4-6 years of age (before kindergarten or first grade).  During measles outbreaks, infants aged 6-11 months may receive a single 0.5 mL dose, but they still need the standard two-dose series later.  Variations in scheduling may occur based on outbreak situations and individual risk factors, as determined by a healthcare professional.

**Adult Dosage:**  Adults born in or after 1957 should receive at least one dose unless they have proven immunity.  Adults born before 1957 are generally considered immune but might benefit from one or two doses depending on their risk factors and lack of immunity evidence.  Specific recommendations vary widely based on occupation (healthcare workers), travel history (international travel), immune status (HIV positive), and community outbreaks.  Two doses are often recommended for high-risk groups.  Pregnant women should not receive the vaccine.  Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

**Administration:**  The vaccine is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the upper arm.  Do not administer intravenously.

### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Mild fever
* Rash
* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Headache
* Fatigue

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)
* Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder)
* Other rare neurological complications


**Note:**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience a severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue).  While rare, serious side effects can occur.  Consult a doctor if you experience any concerning symptoms.

### How it Works
The MMR vaccine uses live, attenuated (weakened) viruses of measles, mumps, and rubella.  These weakened viruses trigger the body's immune system to produce antibodies against these three diseases without causing illness. This immunity provides long-term protection against future infections.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** The MMR vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of allergic reactions to the vaccine components (e.g., gelatin, neomycin), active febrile illness, active untreated tuberculosis, and those who are severely immunocompromised.  It is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy.

**Interactions:**  Immune globulins and immunosuppressants can reduce the vaccine's effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects.  Discuss all medications and medical conditions with a healthcare provider before receiving the vaccine.

**Warnings:**  Individuals with a history of seizures, neurological conditions, or thrombocytopenia should be carefully monitored.   The vaccine should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions.  Patients should be observed for 15 minutes after vaccination for signs of an allergic reaction.


### FAQs

**Q: Is the MMR vaccine safe?**

A: The MMR vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines available.  While side effects can occur, serious complications are extremely rare.  The benefits of preventing measles, mumps, and rubella far outweigh the risks.

**Q: How long does the MMR vaccine protect me?**

A:  The MMR vaccine provides long-lasting immunity, often for decades, for most individuals. However, booster doses might be recommended in certain situations, particularly in high-risk individuals or during outbreaks.

**Q: Can I get the MMR vaccine if I'm pregnant?**

A: No. The MMR vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Women planning pregnancy should be vaccinated beforehand, allowing sufficient time before conception.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A: Most side effects are mild and temporary. However, if you experience severe allergic reactions or other concerning symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.

**Q: How is the MMR vaccine stored?**

A:  The vaccine must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated at a specific temperature.   Improper storage can render the vaccine ineffective.

**Q: Can I get the MMR vaccine if I have a mild cold?**

A: A mild cold is usually not a contraindication to receiving the MMR vaccine. However, consult a healthcare professional to determine if it's safe to proceed based on your specific health status.
