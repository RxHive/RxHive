# Measles Vaccine Live
### Generic Name
Measles Vaccine, Live

### Usage

The Measles Vaccine, Live, is primarily used to prevent measles, a highly contagious viral illness.  Measles is characterized by fever, cough, runny nose, and a distinctive rash.  The vaccine is crucial in protecting individuals from the potentially serious complications of measles, which can include pneumonia, encephalitis (brain inflammation), and even death.  While its primary use is preventing measles,  it's often administered as part of combined MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) or MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) vaccines offering broader protection against multiple childhood illnesses.

### Dosage

The Measles Vaccine, Live, is typically administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  The standard dosage for both children and adults is one dose of the live attenuated (weakened) virus. The timing of vaccination is usually determined by health guidelines and recommendations, which vary across regions and may change over time.  

* **Infants:**  A first dose is usually recommended between 6 and 12 months of age, and  a second dose is given between 4 and 6 years of age. The specific schedule should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  
* **Older Children/Adults:**  Those who have not received the vaccine previously may require one or two doses depending on their age, vaccination history, and risk factors. Catch-up vaccination programs are common for older children and adults.
* **Oral Vaccine:**  While historically available, oral measles vaccines are rarely used now in most regions.  Consult with a healthcare professional for any questions about the availability of oral forms.
* **Important Note:**  Precise dosing and scheduling are vital; strict adherence to the recommended vaccination schedule, as advised by healthcare providers, is paramount.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of the Measles Vaccine, Live, are generally mild and temporary. They include:

* Fever
* Rash
* Swelling or redness at the injection site
* Mild discomfort or pain at the injection site
* Runny nose
* Cough
* Temporary joint pain (rare)

Less common but more serious side effects, while rare, warrant immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or throat.
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Encephalitis (brain inflammation)

If you experience any unusual or severe symptoms after vaccination, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

The Measles Vaccine, Live, contains a weakened (attenuated) form of the measles virus.  When administered, this weakened virus triggers an immune response in the body. The body produces antibodies against the measles virus without causing the disease. These antibodies then provide lasting protection against measles infection.  If a vaccinated person is exposed to the measles virus later in life, their immune system will recognize and fight off the virus effectively, preventing the illness from developing.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to neomycin, gelatin, or any component of the vaccine should not receive it.  A thorough review of medical history is essential before vaccination.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  People with severely weakened immune systems (e.g., due to cancer treatment, HIV/AIDS, or other conditions) should consult their doctor before receiving the vaccine, as the live virus might pose a risk.
* **Pregnancy:**  Generally, it's recommended to avoid vaccination during pregnancy.  Pregnant women should discuss vaccination plans with their obstetrician.
* **Interactions with other medications:**  There are no significant drug interactions known to directly affect the measles vaccine's efficacy. However, inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking to rule out any potential issues.
* **Storage:**  The vaccine must be stored appropriately to maintain its effectiveness.  Refer to the package insert for specific storage instructions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the measles vaccine protect me?** A:  The protection provided by the measles vaccine is typically long-lasting, often for many years.  However, booster doses might be recommended based on age, risk factors, and public health guidelines.

* **Q: Can I get measles after receiving the vaccine?** A:  It's rare, but it is possible to get a mild form of measles after vaccination. This is usually a very mild case.

* **Q: Is the measles vaccine safe for babies?** A: Yes, the measles vaccine is generally considered safe for infants, and vaccination is highly recommended based on the recommended vaccination schedule provided by healthcare professionals.

* **Q: What should I do if my child develops a fever after the vaccine?** A: A mild fever is a common side effect.  Give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen (as directed by your pediatrician) to manage the fever.  Contact your doctor if the fever is high, persistent, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms.
