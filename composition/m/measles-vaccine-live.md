# Measles Vaccine Live

**Generic Name:** Measles Virus Vaccine, Live

**Usage:**  The measles vaccine is used to prevent measles infection.  It's typically given as part of a combined MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine, or sometimes as a single measles vaccine, particularly in situations where there's a measles outbreak or for individuals with contraindications to the mumps or rubella components.  The recommended schedule varies by country and health authority, but generally involves one or two doses in childhood.

**Side Effects:**  Most side effects are mild and temporary. They usually appear within 5-12 days after vaccination and resolve within a week or two.  These can include:

* **Common:**  Fever (often low-grade), rash (similar to, but usually milder than, measles), soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
* **Less Common:**  Headache, muscle aches, joint pain, fatigue, temporary decrease in appetite.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but possible.  Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) are extremely rare complications.


**How it Works:** The measles vaccine contains a weakened (attenuated) form of the measles virus.  When administered, this weakened virus replicates in the body, triggering an immune response.  The body produces antibodies against the measles virus, providing immunity without causing the disease. This immunity typically lasts for many years, if not a lifetime, though booster doses may be recommended in certain situations (e.g., healthcare workers, international travelers).

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is the measles vaccine safe?** A: Yes, the measles vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines available.  The benefits of preventing measles far outweigh the risks of potential side effects.
* **Q: Can I get measles from the vaccine?** A:  The virus in the vaccine is weakened, meaning it's unlikely to cause measles.  Very rarely, a mild, atypical rash might occur.
* **Q: Who shouldn't get the measles vaccine?** A: Individuals with severe allergic reactions to the vaccine components (e.g., neomycin) or a history of anaphylaxis after a previous dose should not receive the vaccine. People with severely weakened immune systems (due to conditions like cancer or HIV) may have a reduced response to the vaccine and should consult their doctor.  Pregnant individuals should generally avoid receiving live vaccines unless absolutely necessary, however the risk to the mother from measles is usually considered much higher than the theoretical risk to the fetus from the vaccine.  Always consult a physician regarding vaccination during pregnancy.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or healthcare provider to determine the best course of action.  Catching up on missed doses is usually possible.
* **Q: How effective is the measles vaccine?** A:  The measles vaccine is highly effective, with a greater than 97% effectiveness rate in preventing measles after two doses.
