# Morphine (systemic)
### Generic Name
Morphine (systemic)

### Usage
Morphine is a powerful opioid pain reliever used to manage both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) pain.  It's reserved for situations where other pain medications, like non-opioids or combination opioid products, haven't worked well enough, are poorly tolerated, or are otherwise inadequate for managing the patient's pain.  Extended-release formulations are not suitable for treating pain on an as-needed basis.  While primarily used for pain relief, morphine may also be used off-label in certain situations like managing acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) pain or providing analgesia to critically ill patients.  The use in these situations requires careful medical supervision and dose adjustment.

### Dosage
Morphine dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (IV, IM, subcutaneous, oral, epidural, intrathecal, rectal), the patient's age, weight, overall health, tolerance to opioids (prior opioid use), and the severity of the pain.  The information below is a summary and should not substitute for guidance from a healthcare professional.  Dosage should always be determined and monitored by a physician or other qualified healthcare provider.

**Adult Dosage (examples only; consult prescribing information for complete details):**

* **Pain Management (Opioid-naive patients):** Initial doses are typically lower, and subsequent doses are adjusted based on the patient's response.  For example, intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) initial doses might range from 5-10 mg every 4 hours as needed, while intravenous (IV) might start at 2.5-5 mg every 3-4 hours.  Patients with prior opioid exposure will require higher initial doses.
* **Pain Management (Opioid-tolerant patients):**  Higher and more frequent doses are generally needed. Continuous IV or SubQ infusions, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), and epidural or intrathecal routes may be used. Doses can vary widely (e.g., IV continuous infusion ranging from 0.8-10mg/hour).
* **Other routes of administration:**  Oral immediate-release, extended-release capsules and tablets, and rectal suppositories are also available, with dosage varying greatly based on the formulation and the patient's individual needs.

**Pediatric Dosage (examples only; consult prescribing information for complete details):**

Pediatric dosing is strictly weight-based and requires careful monitoring.  Dosages are significantly lower than adult doses and vary based on the route of administration and the specific indication (acute pain, chronic pain, palliative care, etc.).  A physician or other qualified healthcare provider must determine the appropriate dosage for children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of morphine can include:

* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Urinary retention

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Confusion
* Hallucinations
* Addiction


**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns about side effects.


### How it Works
Morphine is an opioid agonist, meaning it binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). This binding action inhibits the transmission of pain signals along ascending pain pathways, effectively reducing pain perception and response.  Additionally, morphine causes generalized CNS depression, contributing to its sedative and analgesic effects.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Morphine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to morphine or any component of the formulation; those with significant respiratory depression; those with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting; those who have used MAOIs within 14 days; and patients with GI obstruction.  There are additional contraindications for specific routes of administration (e.g., epidural/intrathecal).
* **Interactions:** Morphine can interact negatively with many other drugs, including CNS depressants (alcohol, sedatives, benzodiazepines), muscle relaxants, other opioids, MAOIs and others. Concomitant use with certain medications may significantly increase the risk of serious side effects.
* **Warnings:**  Morphine carries a risk of addiction, abuse, and misuse.  Respiratory depression is a significant risk, particularly during initiation or dose increases. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome is a risk in pregnant women who use morphine for prolonged periods.  Careful monitoring is essential, especially in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and patients with other pre-existing conditions.  Specific precautions apply to different routes of administration (e.g., epidural/intrathecal requires close monitoring).


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I stop taking morphine suddenly?** A: No.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always talk to your doctor before stopping morphine.
* **Q: How should I store morphine?** A: Store morphine as directed by your pharmacist.  Keep it out of reach of children.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Is morphine addictive?** A: Yes, morphine is an opioid and carries a risk of addiction.  Your doctor will monitor you for signs of addiction.
* **Q:  What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Overdose can be life-threatening.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking morphine?** A:  No, avoid alcohol as it can increase the risk of dangerous side effects, especially respiratory depression.  The same applies to other CNS depressants.
