# Mebeverine
### Generic Name
Mebeverine

### Usage
Mebeverine is primarily used to relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  These symptoms often include abdominal pain, cramping, and discomfort associated with bowel spasms.  It's also sometimes used to treat painful spasms in other organic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, although this is a secondary and less common application.  It's important to understand that mebeverine treats the symptoms, not the underlying cause of the condition.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (tablet, capsule, suspension) and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

**Adults (Gastrointestinal Symptoms):**

* **Immediate-release tablets:** 135 mg three times a day (TID) using 135 mg tablets, or 100 mg three or four times a day (TID or QID) using 100 mg tablets. The dose may be gradually reduced after several weeks of symptom relief.
* **Modified-release capsules:** 200 mg twice a day (BID), typically in the morning and evening.
* **Suspension:** 150 mg (15 mL) three times a day (TID). The dose may be gradually reduced after several weeks of symptom relief.

**Children (Gastrointestinal Symptoms, Aged 10 and Older):**

* **Suspension:**  150 mg (15 mL) three times a day (TID). The dose may be gradually reduced after several weeks of symptom relief.  Use in younger children should only be directed by a physician.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are typically needed for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
The following are potential side effects of mebeverine.  This is not an exhaustive list, and the frequency of these effects is not always specified in clinical trials.  Consult your doctor if you experience any concerning side effects.

* **Common:** Dizziness, headache, insomnia, malaise, decreased pulse, anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia (indigestion), heartburn.
* **Less Common (Post-marketing and/or case reports):** Angioedema (swelling under the skin), facial edema (swelling of the face), hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), skin rash, urticaria (hives).

### How it Works
Mebeverine is classified as an antispasmodic agent.  It works directly on the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract. Unlike some other antispasmodics, it doesn't significantly affect the normal movement of the intestines.  Instead, it selectively relaxes the muscles that are causing painful spasms, thus relieving pain and discomfort without impeding normal bowel function.  It achieves this effect via calcium channel inhibition and antimuscarinic actions.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Mebeverine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to mebeverine or any component of its formulation.
* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with partial or complete atrioventricular heart block, angina, or severe ischemic heart disease.  Also use with caution in neonates and in patients on a sodium-restricted diet.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Mebeverine is generally categorized as pregnancy category B; however, avoiding use during pregnancy is recommended. It's also excreted in breast milk; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking mebeverine.
* **Other Medications:**  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as interactions may occur.
