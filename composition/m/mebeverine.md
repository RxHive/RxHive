# Mebeverine

**Generic Name:** Mebeverine

**Usage:** Mebeverine is used to relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), specifically abdominal pain and cramping associated with this condition.  It's important to note that it does not treat the underlying cause of IBS, only the symptoms.

**Side Effects:**  Mebeverine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These are usually mild and may include:

* **Constipation:** This is a relatively common side effect.
* **Dry mouth:**  Less common.
* **Nausea:**  Uncommon.
* **Headache:** Uncommon.
* **Dizziness:**  Rare.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare, but possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing.

**How it Works:** Mebeverine is an antispasmodic medication.  It works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the walls of the intestines. This reduces the intensity and frequency of painful contractions associated with IBS, providing relief from abdominal cramps and pain.  Unlike some other antispasmodics, mebeverine doesn't significantly affect other parts of the body, such as the heart.
