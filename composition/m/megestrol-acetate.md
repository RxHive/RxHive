# Megestrol Acetate
### Generic Name
Megestrol Acetate

### Usage

Megestrol acetate is primarily used to treat anorexia, cachexia (severe weight loss and muscle wasting), or unexplained significant weight loss in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).  It's a synthetic progestin, meaning it mimics the effects of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone.  Beyond AIDS-related weight loss, it also plays a role in palliative care (managing symptoms and improving quality of life) for advanced breast cancer and endometrial cancer.  While not its primary indication, it's sometimes used off-label to treat cancer-related cachexia in other types of cancer as well.  The use of Megestrol acetate should always be under the guidance of a physician.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the condition being treated and the formulation of the medicine (tablet or suspension).  It's crucial to follow your doctor's prescription exactly.  

**Adults:**

* **Anorexia/Cachexia (AIDS-related):**  Oral suspension:  The dosage is typically 625 mg/day (of the 125 mg/mL suspension) or 800 mg/day (of the 40 mg/mL suspension). Note that different suspensions have different concentrations, so the milligram amount is key, not the volume.

* **Advanced Breast Cancer:** Oral tablet: Usually starts at 160 mg/day, divided into four doses (40 mg four times a day) for at least two months.

* **Advanced Endometrial Cancer:** Oral tablet:  The dosage can range from 40-320 mg/day in divided doses for at least two months, potentially increasing to as much as 800 mg/day depending on response.


* **Cancer-Related Cachexia (off-label):** Oral: Doses typically range from 480-600 mg/day.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of megestrol acetate in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children unless specifically prescribed and monitored by a pediatric oncologist.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However,  caution is warranted, especially in those with kidney problems, as a significant amount of megestrol acetate is excreted through the urine.  Always consult your doctor about potential adjustments based on your individual health status.

If you experience any concerning side effects,  contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Megestrol acetate is a synthetic progestin with antiestrogenic properties. It works by disrupting the normal estrogen cycle, interfering with the estrogen receptors in the body. This action can lead to lower levels of luteinizing hormone (LH).  It's thought to stimulate appetite by counteracting the effects of catabolic cytokines (molecules that promote the breakdown of tissues), which are often elevated in conditions like cancer and AIDS. In cancer treatment, it may also have a direct effect on the endometrium (uterine lining) and interfere with tumor growth.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Megestrol acetate is categorized as Pregnancy Category X (oral suspension) and Category D (oral tablet), meaning it can cause significant birth defects. It's contraindicated during pregnancy for treating anorexia or cachexia related to HIV.  Effective contraception is crucial for women of childbearing age.

* **Breastfeeding:** Megestrol acetate is excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued if this medication is administered for cancer treatment.  Due to the risk of HIV transmission, breastfeeding is not recommended when treating women for anorexia/cachexia related to HIV.

* **Interactions:** Megestrol acetate can interact with other medications.  Specifically, it can decrease the effectiveness of cisplatin (a chemotherapy drug) and indinavir (an antiviral drug). Enzyme-inducing drugs may also reduce megestrol acetate's concentration.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Contraindications:**  Megestrol acetate is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected pregnancy (for suspension formulation) and hypersensitivity to the medication.


* **Warnings:** Increased risks for vaginal bleeding/discharge, Cushing syndrome, new-onset or worsening diabetes, and adrenal suppression exist. Use caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease (blood clots) or diabetes.  Formulations containing benzyl alcohol should be used with caution in neonates.



### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take to see results from megestrol acetate?**

A: The time it takes to see effects varies depending on the condition being treated and the individual. Weight gain may not be immediately noticeable, but appetite stimulation might be seen sooner.

**Q: Can I stop taking megestrol acetate suddenly?**

A: No, you should not stop taking megestrol acetate suddenly, especially if it's prescribed for cancer.  Stopping abruptly could have adverse effects. Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

**Q: How should I store megestrol acetate?**

A: Store megestrol acetate tablets as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.  Suspensions should be shaken well before each use and stored as directed on the label.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
