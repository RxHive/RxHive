# Meningococcal Group A, C, W135 and Y conjugate vaccine
### Generic Name
Meningococcal Group A, C, W135 and Y conjugate vaccine

### Usage
This vaccine is used for active immunization against invasive meningococcal disease.  This disease is caused by bacteria called *Neisseria meningitidis*, specifically serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135.  These bacteria can cause serious infections like meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord lining) and septicemia (blood poisoning).  The vaccine helps prevent these life-threatening illnesses.  It's primarily used for preventing these infections, but it doesn't protect against all strains of *Neisseria meningitidis*, notably serogroup B.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the individual's risk for meningococcal disease and prior vaccination history.

* **Routine Vaccination (Ages 19-21):**  A single 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose might be considered as a catch-up if no dose was given after age 16.  Routine vaccination is not typically recommended for adults over 21.

* **Increased Risk (Regardless of Age):** This includes individuals with weakened immune systems (e.g., those with functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV, or complement deficiencies), first-year college students in residential housing, military recruits, travelers to high-risk areas, or those exposed to *Neisseria meningitidis* in a laboratory setting.  These individuals usually require two 0.5 mL IM doses given at least 2 months apart.  If a single dose was previously given, a second dose is recommended as soon as possible (at least 8 weeks apart). Restarting the entire two-dose series isn’t necessary.

* **Booster Dose:** Adults previously vaccinated may require a booster dose every 5 years if they remain at increased risk. For those under 21, a booster might be necessary if their initial dose was administered before age 16.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Use in children under 11 years old is generally only recommended for those at increased risk; routine use is not recommended in this age group.  Dosages are product-specific, and certain products should be avoided in children under 2 due to potential interference with other vaccines.  For children aged 11-12 years, or adolescents who are not at increased risk, and haven’t been vaccinated before, a single 0.5 mL IM dose is usually recommended.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in more than 10% of recipients):**

* Pain, swelling, redness, or tenderness at the injection site
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Muscle aches
* Fever
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Irritability (in children)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Guillain-Barré syndrome (a rare neurological disorder)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Seizures

**Important Note:**  Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.  This list isn't exhaustive, and other side effects are possible.

### How it Works

The vaccine works by introducing weakened or inactive parts of the *Neisseria meningitidis* bacteria (serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135) into the body. This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that specifically target these bacteria.  If the person is later exposed to these bacteria, the antibodies are ready to fight off the infection, preventing or lessening the severity of the disease.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  The vaccine should not be given to individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions (like anaphylaxis) to any components of the vaccine, including diphtheria toxoid or CRM197 (a carrier protein), or tetanus toxoid.

* **Precautions:**  Use caution in individuals with bleeding disorders, those receiving anticoagulant therapy, or those with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.  The vaccine should generally be avoided during periods of acute illness.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While inactivated bacterial vaccines haven't shown increased risks to the fetus, the decision to vaccinate pregnant individuals should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the benefits and risks.  The effects of the vaccine on breastfeeding are unknown, but inactivated vaccines generally don't affect breastfeeding safety.

* **Interactions:**  Some medications, such as immunosuppressants (including some biologics like belimumab and fingolimod), can reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.  Consult with your doctor about any medications you're taking before receiving this vaccine.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the protection from this vaccine last?**  A:  Protection typically lasts for several years, but booster doses may be recommended depending on risk factors.

* **Q: Can this vaccine cause meningococcal disease?** A: No. This is an inactivated vaccine; it cannot cause the disease it's designed to prevent.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe reaction to the vaccine?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: Can I get this vaccine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: Discuss this with your doctor; vaccination might be recommended for those at increased risk during pregnancy.  The effects on breastfeeding are largely unknown, but inactivated vaccines are usually considered safe for mothers and infants.

* **Q: Where can I get this vaccine?**  A:  Contact your doctor or a local health clinic to inquire about vaccination.
