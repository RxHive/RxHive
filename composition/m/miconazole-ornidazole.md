# Miconazole + Ornidazole

**Generic Name:** Miconazole + Ornidazole

**Usage:** This combination medication is an antifungal and antibacterial agent used to treat various vaginal infections, particularly those caused by a mix of fungi (like *Candida*) and bacteria (*Trichomonas vaginalis*, and other anaerobic bacteria).  It's typically prescribed for vaginitis (vaginal inflammation) or vulvovaginitis (inflammation of the vulva and vagina).  The specific indication will be determined by a healthcare professional.  **Important Note:** This medication is specifically for vaginal infections and should not be used for other conditions.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects may include:

* **Vaginal:** Irritation, burning, itching, discharge changes (color, consistency, amount).
* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea.
* **Other:** Headache, dizziness.

Less common but more serious side effects may require immediate medical attention and include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).
* Severe abdominal pain.
* Changes in vision.
* Unusual bleeding.

This is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences may vary.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.

**How it Works:**

* **Miconazole:** This is an antifungal medication that works by disrupting the cell membranes of fungi, leading to their death.  It primarily targets *Candida* species, common culprits in yeast infections.
* **Ornidazole:** This is an antibacterial medication that belongs to the nitroimidazole class. It works by interfering with the DNA of certain bacteria, specifically anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that thrive in oxygen-poor environments) like those responsible for bacterial vaginosis and *Trichomonas vaginalis* infections.  The combination allows for broader coverage of potential pathogens causing the infection.
