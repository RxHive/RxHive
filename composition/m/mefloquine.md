# Mefloquine
### Generic Name
Mefloquine

### Usage

Mefloquine is primarily used for the treatment and prevention (prophylaxis) of malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted by mosquitoes.  It's effective against both *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax*,  the two most common species causing malaria in humans.  While its primary use is in areas where malaria is endemic or where resistance to other antimalarial drugs is prevalent, it's crucial to note that mefloquine is increasingly being considered a last-line treatment option due to emerging resistance and concerns about its side effects.  Off-label uses may exist, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Note: Dosage is expressed as milligrams of mefloquine hydrochloride base):**

* **Treatment of Malaria:**  The usual single dose for mild to moderate infections is 1250 mg (typically given as 5 tablets).  If symptoms don't improve within 48-72 hours, alternative treatment is necessary. For uncomplicated infections, an initial dose of 750 mg followed by 500 mg 6-12 hours later may be used (off-label). In cases of uncomplicated *Plasmodium vivax* malaria resistant to chloroquine, a similar regimen is often employed, usually combined with primaquine.

* **Malaria Prophylaxis:** The standard prophylactic dose is 250 mg once weekly.  Start treatment one week before entering a malaria-endemic area, continue weekly throughout the trip, and for four weeks after leaving.  A longer initiation period (2-3 weeks prior to travel) might be considered to assess tolerance.


**Pediatric Dosage (Malaria):**

Mefloquine should be used cautiously in children and only as a last resort due to the increased risk of neuropsychiatric side effects. Dosage is weight-based:

* **Treatment:** The initial dose is 15 mg/kg as a single dose (maximum 750 mg), followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) after 6-12 hours.  It's typically used in combination with other antimalarials.

* **Prophylaxis:** The dose is 5 mg/kg weekly (maximum 250 mg).  Begin at least two weeks before travel to the endemic area and continue for four weeks after leaving.  Fixed-dose regimens (based on weight categories) are also available.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dose adjustments are recommended for renal impairment.  Use caution in patients with liver disease as mefloquine levels may be elevated.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Abnormal dreams, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, and abdominal pain.


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Neuropsychiatric reactions (including anxiety, depression, psychosis, seizures, and suicidal thoughts), cardiac arrhythmias (especially QT prolongation),  allergic reactions (skin rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and blood disorders (e.g., agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia).


**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed above, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Mefloquine is a quinolinemethanol derivative with a similar structure to quinine.  It acts by interfering with the parasite's ability to reproduce within red blood cells.  Specifically, it inhibits the parasite's heme detoxification process, leading to the buildup of toxic heme, which eventually kills the parasite.  This effect is primarily on the asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Mefloquine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to mefloquine, related quinoline drugs (quinine, quinidine), or any formulation component.  It's also contraindicated for malaria prophylaxis in those with a history of seizures or psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety, psychosis).

**Interactions:** Mefloquine can interact with numerous medications, increasing the risk of side effects. These interactions include drugs affecting the QT interval (e.g., certain antiarrhythmics, some antibiotics), those affecting the central nervous system (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics), and others.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

**Warnings:** Mefloquine can cause serious neuropsychiatric side effects, some of which may be long-lasting.  Patients should be closely monitored for mental health changes.  Use caution in patients with liver disease, as metabolism of the drug is affected.  Consult a healthcare professional before using mefloquine during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment.

### FAQs

**Q: Can I take mefloquine with alcohol?**
A: No. Alcohol can increase the risk of side effects, particularly neuropsychiatric ones.


**Q: How should I store mefloquine?**
A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Keep out of reach of children.


**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.


**Q: Is mefloquine safe for pregnant women?**
A: The safety of mefloquine during pregnancy has not been fully established. It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks, and always under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.


**Q: How long does it take for mefloquine to work?**
A:  The effect of mefloquine for malaria prophylaxis is immediate, preventing malaria infection.  For treating an existing infection, it may take a few days to see improvement.


**Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially neuropsychiatric symptoms, cardiac issues, or allergic reactions.  This information is not a substitute for professional medical advice.  Always consult with a physician or other qualified healthcare provider before starting or changing any medication.
