# Mefloquine

**Generic Name:** Mefloquine hydrochloride

**Usage:**

Mefloquine is an antimalarial drug used to prevent and treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, *Plasmodium vivax*, *Plasmodium ovale*, and *Plasmodium malariae*.  It's specifically used for areas where chloroquine-resistant malaria is prevalent.  It's often used for prophylaxis (prevention) of malaria in travelers to high-risk areas, and for treatment of uncomplicated malaria when other drugs are ineffective or not tolerated.  Note that it is *not* recommended for treating severe malaria.  The specific dosage and duration will vary depending on the individual, the type of malaria, and the area of travel, and should be determined by a healthcare professional.


**Side Effects:**

Mefloquine has a relatively high incidence of side effects compared to other antimalarials.  These can range from mild to severe and can include:

* **Common:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, vivid dreams or nightmares, insomnia, anxiety, depression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Neuropsychiatric effects (such as psychosis, seizures, hallucinations, confusion), heart rhythm abnormalities, hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing in the ears).  These are more likely to occur with higher doses or in individuals with pre-existing conditions.
* **Rare but Severe:**  Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to a doctor immediately.


**How it Works:**

Mefloquine is a quinoline antimalarial drug.  Its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's believed to interfere with the parasite's ability to reproduce and survive within red blood cells.  It primarily acts against the asexual blood stages of the malaria parasite.
