# Moexipril
### Generic Name
Moexipril

### Usage
Moexipril is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  Its primary mechanism involves lowering blood pressure, thus reducing the risk of associated complications such as stroke and heart attack.  While not its primary indication, Moexipril may also play a role in managing certain heart conditions, though this would always be under the strict guidance of a physician.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  The starting dose for hypertension is typically 7.5 mg once daily, taken one hour before a meal.  If the patient is already taking a thiazide diuretic, the initial dose should be reduced to 3.75 mg once daily.  The maintenance dose can range from 7.5 mg to 30 mg per day, given in one or two divided doses.  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with impaired renal function.  For those with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m², no dosage adjustments are specified, but caution is advised.  However, if CrCl is 40 mL/min/1.73 m² or less, the initial dose should be 3.75 mg once daily, with a maximum daily dose of 15 mg.  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic impairment, although increased systemic exposure is a consideration.  Moexipril is available in tablet form.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of moexipril in children have not been established.

### How it Works

Moexipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.  It works by blocking the action of an enzyme called ACE, which is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor (a substance that narrows blood vessels), causing blood pressure to rise. By inhibiting ACE, moexipril reduces the amount of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and a decrease in blood pressure.  This also increases plasma renin activity and reduces aldosterone secretion, further contributing to blood pressure reduction.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Moexipril is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to moexipril, other ACE inhibitors, or any component of the formulation; a history of hereditary or angioedema associated with previous ACE inhibitor treatment; bilateral renal artery stenosis; and concomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²).

**Interactions:** Moexipril can interact with several other medications, including diuretics, NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics, lithium, gold, anesthetic drugs, narcotic drugs/antipsychotics, allopurinol, cytostatic or immunosuppressive agents, systemic corticosteroids, procainamide, sodium chloride, alcohol, and antidiabetics. These interactions can either enhance or reduce the effects of moexipril or lead to adverse reactions.  Close monitoring is crucial when combining moexipril with other medications.

**Warnings:**  Moexipril should be used cautiously in patients with aortic stenosis, collagen vascular disease (especially with concomitant renal impairment), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, unilateral/bilateral renal artery stenosis, pre-existing renal insufficiency, before, during, or after major surgery, and those with hyperkalemia. There is a boxed warning regarding fetal toxicity;  moexipril should be discontinued as soon as possible if pregnancy is detected.  


### FAQs

**Q: Can I take moexipril with other medications?**
A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting moexipril.  Some medications may interact with moexipril, potentially leading to adverse effects.

**Q: How should I store moexipril?**
A: Store moexipril in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

**Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects, especially those listed in the serious side effects section.

**Q: Is moexipril safe during pregnancy?**
A: No, moexipril is not safe during pregnancy and should be discontinued immediately if pregnancy is detected.  It can cause serious harm to the developing fetus.  Discuss birth control options with your physician before starting this medication.

**Q:  How long does it take for moexipril to work?**
A: The time it takes to notice the effects of moexipril varies from person to person, but blood pressure usually begins to lower within a few weeks of starting treatment.  Regular monitoring is necessary to adjust the dosage and ensure effectiveness.
