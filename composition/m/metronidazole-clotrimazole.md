# Metronidazole + Clotrimazole

**Generic Name:** Metronidazole + Clotrimazole (combination product)  Note:  This is a combination, not a single generic name.  Specific brand names will vary by country and manufacturer.

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to treat vaginal infections that are caused by both bacteria (like *Gardnerella vaginalis* and *Trichomonas vaginalis*) and fungi (like *Candida albicans*). It's important to note that a doctor should diagnose the infection before prescribing this medication.  It's used to treat conditions like bacterial vaginosis complicated by a yeast infection.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary depending on the specific formulation (e.g., cream, tablet) and individual sensitivity, but common potential side effects include:

* **Local (vaginal):** Burning, itching, irritation, redness, swelling of the vagina or vulva.
* **Systemic (throughout the body):**  Metronidazole can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste in the mouth, headache, dizziness.  These are less common with topical formulations.  Allergic reactions, though rare, are possible.

**How it Works:**

* **Metronidazole:** This is an antibiotic that works by interfering with the DNA of certain bacteria, ultimately killing them.  It's effective against anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that live in oxygen-poor environments), such as those responsible for bacterial vaginosis.
* **Clotrimazole:** This is an antifungal medication that disrupts the fungal cell membrane, leading to fungal cell death. It is effective against various Candida species, the most common cause of yeast infections.

The combination provides dual action against both the bacterial and fungal components often present in mixed vaginal infections.
