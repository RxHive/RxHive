# Mephenytoin
### Generic Name
Mephenytoin

### Usage
Mephenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication.  Its primary use was to control various types of seizures, including grand mal (tonic-clonic), focal (partial), Jacksonian (a type of focal seizure), and psychomotor (complex partial) seizures.  It was typically reserved for patients whose seizures were not adequately controlled by other, less toxic anticonvulsant medications.  It's important to note that mephenytoin is no longer commercially available in many regions.

### Dosage
Because mephenytoin is no longer widely available, specific dosage information should not be taken as a guide for self-medication.  Historically, dosages were highly individualized and carefully determined by a physician based on the patient's response and tolerance.  The medication came in various forms, and the dosage would vary depending on the formulation and the patient's condition.  It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate seizure management if mephenytoin was previously prescribed.

### Side Effects
Common side effects associated with mephenytoin could include:

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Skin rash

Less common but more serious side effects might include blood disorders and liver damage.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported immediately to a doctor.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism of action of mephenytoin isn't fully understood, but research suggests that it primarily works by blocking sodium channels in nerve cells.  These sodium channels are crucial for the transmission of nerve impulses. By blocking them, mephenytoin reduces the abnormal electrical activity in the brain that causes seizures. This helps to control the frequency and severity of seizures.

### Precautions
Mephenytoin carries several precautions.  Because its metabolism is highly variable depending on individual genetic factors, careful monitoring is essential. Interactions with other medications are possible, and it was often avoided in individuals with pre-existing liver or kidney problems.   Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and monitoring due to potential risks to the developing fetus or infant.  Given its discontinuation from the market, this information is provided for educational purposes only and shouldn't guide self-treatment.  Always consult a healthcare provider for appropriate seizure management.

* **Q: Why was mephenytoin discontinued?** A:  While not explicitly stated universally, it was likely due to a combination of factors, including the availability of safer and more effective anti-epileptic drugs with fewer side effects and its complex metabolism.

* **Q:  Can I use mephenytoin if I have liver or kidney disease?** A:  Historically, mephenytoin was generally avoided in patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disease due to the risk of increased toxicity. Given its unavailability, this is no longer a concern.
