# Moxisylyte
### Generic Name
Moxisylyte (also known as Thymoxamine)

### Usage
Moxisylyte is primarily used for the short-term symptomatic relief of primary Raynaud's phenomenon.  Raynaud's phenomenon is a condition causing reduced blood flow to the fingers and toes, leading to discoloration and numbness.  Moxisylyte helps to improve blood flow to these extremities, alleviating the symptoms.  It's important to note that moxisylyte treats the symptoms, not the underlying cause of Raynaud's.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Raynaud's Phenomenon):**

* **Oral:** The typical starting dose is 40 mg four times a day (QID).  If symptoms are not adequately controlled, the dose may be increased to 80 mg QID.  For patients experiencing symptoms primarily during daytime cold exposure, the medication might be taken every 3 hours during the time of anticipated symptoms.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Moxisylyte is not approved for use in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with liver impairment. Use with extreme caution, and it's contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with kidney impairment.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Facial flushing
* Skin rash
* Diarrhea
* Nausea

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Cholestatic jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Moxisylyte is an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent.  This means it works by blocking the effects of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that constricts blood vessels. By blocking this action, moxisylyte helps to relax the blood vessels, particularly in the fingers and toes, improving blood flow and relieving the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon.  Importantly, it acts specifically on alpha-receptors and does not affect beta-receptors, or have anti-angiotensin or anti-serotonin activity.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Moxisylyte is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to moxisylyte or any of its components and in those with active liver disease.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes and elderly individuals.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tricyclic antidepressants can potentially increase the hypotensive (blood pressure lowering) effects of moxisylyte.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Moxisylyte should be avoided during pregnancy.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, so it should also be avoided during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for moxisylyte to work?** A: The onset of action can vary, but improvement in symptoms is generally seen within a short period after taking the medication.  However, if no improvement is seen after two weeks, the treatment should be discontinued.

* **Q: Can I drive while taking moxisylyte?** A:  Drowsiness or dizziness are possible side effects.  Avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience these symptoms.

* **Q: How should I store moxisylyte?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I stop taking moxisylyte suddenly?** A:  It is advisable to consult your doctor before abruptly stopping the medication.  They may recommend a gradual reduction in dosage to minimize any potential withdrawal effects.
