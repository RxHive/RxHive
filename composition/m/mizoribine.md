# Mizoribine
### Generic Name
Mizoribine

### Usage
Mizoribine is an immunosuppressant primarily used to prevent organ rejection in kidney transplant recipients.  This means it helps the body accept the new kidney and not attack it as a foreign object.  Beyond transplantation, it also has a role in treating lupus nephritis (kidney inflammation caused by lupus), specifically cases involving continuous proteinuria (protein in the urine), nephrotic syndrome (kidney damage leading to protein loss in urine), renal failure, or situations where treatment with corticosteroids (like cortisol) alone hasn't been successful.  Finally, Mizoribine can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in patients who haven't responded well to a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other anti-rheumatic medications.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's characteristics.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.

**Prevention of Organ Rejection (Kidney Transplant):**

* **Oral:**  The initial dose is typically 2-3 mg/kg/day, divided into 1-3 doses.  The maintenance dose is usually 1-3 mg/kg/day, also divided.  Higher doses (over 5 mg/kg/day) may be used in some cases.

**Lupus Nephritis & Rheumatoid Arthritis:**

* **Oral:** The usual dose is 50 mg three times a day (TID).

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of Mizoribine in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't offer specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised, and a reduction in dosage might be considered for patients with severe renal impairment when treating lupus nephritis or rheumatoid arthritis.  Always consult a physician for guidance.


### Side Effects

Mizoribine, like many medications, can cause side effects.  The frequency varies.  Some common side effects (occurring in 0.1% to 5% of patients) include:

* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, headache, malaise (general discomfort), meningitis (rare), paralysis (rare)
* **Cardiovascular:** Edema (swelling)
* **Dermatologic:** Alopecia (hair loss), erythema (redness), pruritus (itching), skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare, serious skin reaction), toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare, serious skin reaction)
* **Endocrine & Metabolic:** Diabetes mellitus (or worsening of existing diabetes), gout, hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), increased levels of certain liver enzymes (gamma-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase), increased thirst, increased uric acid levels
* **Gastrointestinal:** Abdominal pain, anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, diarrhea, dysgeusia (altered taste), glossitis (tongue inflammation), nausea and vomiting, stomatitis (mouth inflammation)
* **Genitourinary:** Hematuria (blood in urine), proteinuria (protein in urine)
* **Hematologic:** Bone marrow suppression, decreased hematocrit (low red blood cell count), increased levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), pancytopenia (low counts of all blood cells), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), agranulocytosis (severe lack of white blood cells)
* **Hepatic:** Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALP, ALT, AST, bilirubin), jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), worsening of viral hepatitis
* **Infection:** Sepsis (severe infection), worsening of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or herpes zoster (shingles) infections.
* **Ophthalmic:** Ocular hyperemia (red eyes)
* **Renal:** Cough, increased BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels, increased serum creatinine levels
* **Respiratory:** Abnormal chest x-ray findings, pneumonia, pneumonitis (lung inflammation), respiratory distress
* **Other:** Fever


Less common, but serious side effects, are also possible.  These include  rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), acute renal failure, and various other conditions.  Any unusual or concerning symptom should be reported to your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Mizoribine is an imidazole nucleoside that works by interfering with the body's production of purines. Purines are essential building blocks for DNA and RNA, components crucial for cell growth and replication. By inhibiting purine synthesis, Mizoribine suppresses the activity of the immune system cells (T-cells and B-cells) that are involved in organ rejection and autoimmune responses.  This reduction in immune activity allows the body to tolerate the transplanted organ or reduces the attack on the body's own tissues in autoimmune diseases like lupus nephritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mizoribine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to it, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those with a leukocyte count below 3000/mmÂ³.
* **Warnings:**  Mizoribine can increase the risk of bone marrow suppression, impair fertility, increase the risk of infections (bacterial, viral, and fungal, including reactivation of hepatitis B), and cause renal impairment and secondary malignancies (cancers).  Use caution in patients with active gastrointestinal disorders, bone marrow suppression, and elderly patients.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concurrent use with bezafibrate increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis.  Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from Mizoribine?** A:  The response to Mizoribine can take 2-4 months to become apparent. Treatment should be discontinued if no improvement is seen within 6 months.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Mizoribine?** A:  It's best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor. Alcohol can interact with some medications, and it's advisable to avoid excessive alcohol intake while on immunosuppressants.

* **Q: How should I store Mizoribine?** A:  Store Mizoribine as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Mizoribine suddenly?** A:  No.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding discontinuation of Mizoribine.  Sudden cessation can have adverse effects.
