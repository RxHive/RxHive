# Mometasone + Fusidic Acid
### Generic Name
Mometasone + Fusidic Acid

### Usage
Mometasone furoate and fusidic acid is a combination topical medication used to treat skin infections involving both inflammation and bacterial infection.  It's primarily prescribed for conditions like eczema (dermatitis) that have become secondarily infected with bacteria. This means that the eczema, which causes inflammation and irritation, has been further complicated by a bacterial infection.  The combination is effective because mometasone furoate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching, while fusidic acid is an antibiotic that fights bacterial infection.  The drug is typically used for localized skin infections and is not suitable for treating systemic infections (infections affecting the entire body).  It might also be considered for other inflammatory skin conditions with superimposed bacterial infections, but this should always be determined by a doctor.

### Dosage
Dosage instructions vary significantly depending on the specific formulation (cream, ointment, etc.), the affected area, and the severity of the infection.  Therefore, it's absolutely crucial to follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  

**General Guidelines (These are not a substitute for a doctor's prescription):**

* **Adults and Children (over 1 year):**  A thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected area twice daily, usually morning and evening.  The treatment duration is usually limited, ranging from a few days to a couple of weeks.  The doctor will determine the appropriate duration based on the individual case.
* **Children (under 1 year):** This combination medication is generally not recommended for children under 1 year old, unless specifically directed by a doctor.
* **Oral or IV Administration:**  This combination medication is for topical (external) use only. It is not administered orally or intravenously.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Burning or stinging sensation at the application site, skin dryness, itching, redness.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Skin thinning (especially with prolonged use), skin discoloration, increased risk of secondary infection (if not used properly), allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing).  In rare instances, the absorption of fusidic acid through the skin might cause systemic effects.
* **Important Note:** If any side effects, even mild ones, persist or worsen, discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Mometasone furoate, a corticosteroid, works by reducing inflammation in the skin. It achieves this by suppressing the activity of immune cells that contribute to the inflammatory response. This reduces swelling, redness, and itching associated with conditions like eczema.  Fusidic acid, an antibiotic, inhibits the growth of certain bacteria by interfering with their protein synthesis.  This means it prevents the bacteria from producing the essential proteins needed for their survival and reproduction, effectively combating the bacterial infection. The combined action of these two components makes it effective in managing both the inflammatory and infectious aspects of the skin condition.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you have a known allergy to mometasone furoate, fusidic acid, or any other components of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While relatively few drug interactions are reported, inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.  
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant. The use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully assessed to weigh the benefits against the potential risks.
* **Children:**  Use in children under 1 year should only be undertaken under strict medical supervision.
* **Long-term use:** Avoid prolonged use without consulting your physician.  Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can cause skin thinning and other side effects.
* **Wounds:** Do not apply to open wounds or broken skin.
* **Face:** Use with caution on the face, as it can be more sensitive than other areas of the body.
