# Mometasone + Fusidic Acid

**Generic Name:** Mometasone furoate + Fusidic acid

**Usage:** This combination is a topical steroid and antibiotic used to treat skin conditions that are infected or at risk of infection.  It's typically prescribed for bacterial skin infections complicated by inflammation, such as:

* Impetigo
* Eczema with secondary bacterial infection
* Folliculitis
* Cellulitis (in some cases, milder forms)


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the length of treatment.  Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, skin thinning, irritation, and folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles).  In rare cases, striae (stretch marks) may develop with prolonged use.
* **Systemic effects (less common, especially with short-term use):** Although topical application minimizes systemic absorption, prolonged or extensive use can lead to systemic effects similar to those seen with oral corticosteroids, including changes in blood glucose levels, and suppression of the adrenal gland (rare).


**How it Works:**

* **Mometasone furoate:** This is a potent corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the activity of inflammatory cells in the skin. This helps to control the symptoms of the skin condition.
* **Fusidic acid:** This is an antibiotic. It kills bacteria by interfering with their protein synthesis, effectively treating the bacterial infection.

The combination of mometasone furoate and fusidic acid provides both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial action, addressing both the inflammation and infection simultaneously.

**FAQs:**

* **How long should I use it?**  The duration of treatment depends on the severity of the condition and your doctor's instructions. Usually, it's for a relatively short period, ranging from a few days to a couple of weeks.  Do not exceed the prescribed duration.

* **Can I use it on my face?**  Use on the face should be limited and only as directed by a doctor due to the risk of skin thinning.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not apply a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Can I use it during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only be under the strict supervision of a doctor. The benefits must outweigh the potential risks.

* **Can I use other creams or lotions with it?**  Check with your doctor or pharmacist before using any other topical medications concurrently.  Some interactions are possible.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, discontinue use and consult your doctor immediately.

* **Can I stop using it early if I feel better?**  No, complete the prescribed course of treatment even if your symptoms improve. Stopping early may lead to recurrence of the infection or incomplete resolution of the inflammation.
