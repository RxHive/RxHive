# Methotrexate + Folic Acid

**Generic Name:** Methotrexate + Folic Acid

**Usage:**

This combination therapy is primarily used for:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):**  To reduce inflammation and joint pain associated with RA.  Methotrexate is the primary disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), while folic acid helps mitigate some of its side effects.
* **Psoriatic arthritis:** Similar to RA, it aims to control inflammation and symptoms.
* **Other inflammatory diseases:**  It may be used to treat other autoimmune diseases, although this is less common and often requires specific considerations.
* **Certain cancers:** While methotrexate alone is frequently used in cancer treatment, this combination is rarely used in an oncology setting.

**Important Note:** This combination is not a first-line treatment for any condition.  The decision to prescribe Methotrexate + Folic Acid should be made by a rheumatologist or oncologist based on individual patient factors.  The folic acid is supplementary and does not replace the need for the methotrexate.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the dosage and individual sensitivity.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mouth sores (stomatitis)
* **Hematological:** Reduced blood cell counts (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) - this is a serious side effect requiring blood monitoring.
* **Liver:** Elevated liver enzymes (hepatotoxicity) - liver function tests are crucial during treatment.
* **Kidney:** Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity), especially with higher doses.
* **Lung:** Pulmonary fibrosis (rare but serious)
* **Skin:** Rash, itching, hair loss
* **Fatigue**
* **Headache**

Serious side effects are possible and require immediate medical attention.  These include severe infections, bleeding problems, and organ damage.

**How it Works:**

* **Methotrexate:** This is an antimetabolite, meaning it interferes with the production of DNA and RNA, thus inhibiting cell growth and reducing inflammation.  It's effective in suppressing the immune system's activity in autoimmune diseases.
* **Folic Acid (Folate):** Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps the body produce DNA and RNA.  Methotrexate inhibits folic acid metabolism, leading to some of its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects.  Supplementation with folic acid can lessen some of the side effects of methotrexate, particularly gastrointestinal issues.  However, it does not reduce the risk of all side effects, especially hematological ones.


**FAQs:**

* **How often is it taken?**  Dosage and frequency vary greatly based on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  It's usually administered weekly, either orally or through injection.
* **How long does it take to work?**  It can take several weeks or months to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms.
* **What blood tests are needed?**  Regular blood tests to monitor complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and kidney function tests are essential during treatment.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Yes, several medications can interact with methotrexate.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Consult your doctor immediately.  Do not double the dose without medical advice.
