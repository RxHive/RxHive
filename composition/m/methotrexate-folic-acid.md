# Methotrexate + Folic Acid
### Generic Name
Methotrexate + Folic Acid


### Usage

Methotrexate, combined with folic acid (also known as folinic acid or leucovorin), is primarily used to treat various forms of cancer.  The methotrexate acts as a chemotherapy agent, interfering with cell growth, while the folic acid helps mitigate some of methotrexate's severe side effects.  This combination is particularly effective in treating certain types of leukemia, lymphoma, and other cancers.  It's also used in the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune diseases, where its anti-inflammatory properties help manage symptoms.  In these non-cancerous conditions, the folic acid reduces the risk of serious side effects from methotrexate.


### Dosage

Dosage of methotrexate + folic acid varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, overall health, and response to the medication.  It's crucial to follow a physician's prescribed dosage regimen precisely. There is no standardized "adult" or "child" dosage as this is highly individualized.

* **Oral Methotrexate:**  Dosage ranges from low doses for rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., 7.5-25 mg once weekly) to much higher doses for cancer treatment, often administered in cycles with specific intervals.  Folic acid is usually given separately, often on non-methotrexate days.

* **Intravenous (IV) Methotrexate:**  High-dose IV methotrexate is common in cancer treatment.  The specific dosage and administration schedule are determined by the oncologist.  Leucovorin (the active form of folic acid) is typically administered after the methotrexate to lessen toxicity.  

* **Intramuscular (IM) Methotrexate:**  Less common than oral or IV administration but can be used for certain conditions. Dosage is determined by a physician.

* **Pediatric Dosage:**  Methotrexate dosage in children is calculated based on body surface area (BSA) or weight and is always determined by a pediatric oncologist or rheumatologist.  The dosage is significantly lower than in adults.


**It's absolutely critical to consult with a healthcare professional for specific dosage instructions.**  Improper dosing can lead to severe adverse effects.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores (stomatitis), fatigue, headache, hair loss (alopecia), skin rash.

* **Serious Side Effects (Less Common but Require Immediate Medical Attention):**  Severe bone marrow suppression (leading to decreased blood cell counts), liver damage, kidney damage, lung inflammation, severe allergic reactions, infections.


**Note:**  This list is not exhaustive.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Methotrexate works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.  By blocking DHFR, methotrexate prevents the production of nucleotides needed for DNA replication and cell growth, ultimately slowing or stopping the growth of rapidly dividing cells, like cancer cells and certain immune cells involved in autoimmune diseases.  Folic acid, administered in conjunction with methotrexate, helps protect healthy cells from the damaging effects of methotrexate, particularly those cells that are rapidly dividing and have high DHFR activity. Folic acid supplementation is critical to minimizing the toxic effects of Methotrexate, especially on the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Methotrexate should not be used in individuals with severe liver or kidney disease, bone marrow suppression, pre-existing blood disorders, or active peptic ulcers.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should generally avoid this medication due to its potential harm to the fetus or infant.

* **Drug Interactions:** Methotrexate can interact with many medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, certain vaccines, and other medications that affect the liver or kidneys.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Regular blood tests are necessary to monitor blood counts and liver and kidney function.  Alcohol consumption should be minimized or avoided.  Sun exposure should be limited due to increased risk of sunburn.  Patients should report any signs of infection promptly.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: This depends on the condition being treated. For rheumatoid arthritis, it may take several weeks to see improvement in symptoms. For cancer, the response time varies considerably.

* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A:  Store methotrexate and folic acid as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q:  Can I stop taking the medication if I feel better?** A: No, never stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can have serious consequences.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately for guidance on how to proceed.  Do not take a double dose to compensate for a missed dose.

* **Q:  Is it safe to take with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking.  Many interactions are possible.
