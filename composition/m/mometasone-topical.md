# Mometasone (Topical)
### Generic Name
Mometasone (Topical)

### Usage
Mometasone topical is a corticosteroid used to relieve the inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions responsive to corticosteroids.  Its primary use is in treating corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in patients aged 2 years and older.  This includes conditions like eczema (atopic dermatitis), psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin disorders.


### Dosage

**Adults:** For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, apply a thin film of the 0.1% cream, ointment, or gel once daily (OD) to the affected area(s).  If using the 0.1% lotion or solution, apply a few drops once daily to the affected area(s). Avoid using occlusive dressings unless specifically instructed by a physician. Treatment should stop once the condition is under control. If no improvement is seen within two weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis is necessary.

**Children (2 years and older):** For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, a thin film of the 0.1% cream, ointment, or gel should be applied once daily to affected areas.  For children, avoid use for more than three weeks.  The 0.1% lotion or solution can also be used, applying a few drops once daily and massaging gently.  **Mometasone topical is not recommended for children under 2 years old due to a lack of established safety and efficacy.**

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are needed for patients with hepatic or renal impairment, according to current manufacturer labeling.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Burning or itching at the application site

* Skin discoloration (dyschromia)
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*  Glaucoma

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

Mometasone is a topical corticosteroid with intermediate potency.  Its anti-inflammatory effects stem from inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor to inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This action reduces inflammation, itching, and redness in the affected skin.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mometasone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to mometasone furoate or any formulation component; viral, fungal, or bacterial skin infections; tuberculosis or syphilis of the skin; skin reactions following vaccinations; acne vulgaris; rosacea; and pruritus without inflammation. It should not be used in the eyes or with occlusive dressings unless specifically instructed by a physician.

* **Warnings:** Prolonged use or extensive application of high-potency topical corticosteroids can lead to adrenal suppression, especially in children and infants.  There is a risk of systemic absorption and consequent side effects.  Long-term use may also increase the risk of skin atrophy, glaucoma, and cataracts.  The medication should be used cautiously in the elderly and in children aged 2 years or older.  Use in pregnant or breastfeeding women requires careful consideration due to potential risks.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Mometasone may interact with certain medications.  Consult your healthcare provider about any medications you are currently taking, particularly aldesleukin, deferasirox, hyaluronidase, and ritodrine.
