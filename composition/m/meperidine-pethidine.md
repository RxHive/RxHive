# Meperidine [Pethidine]
### Generic Name
Meperidine (Pethidine)

### Usage
Meperidine is an opioid analgesic primarily used for the short-term management of moderate to severe pain when other treatments are insufficient.  Its use is generally limited to situations where the benefits outweigh the significant risks.  Specific indications include:

* **Acute pain:**  Meperidine may be used for short-term management (typically less than 48 hours) of acute pain in adults and children, although its use is increasingly discouraged due to safer alternatives and the risk of serious side effects.
* **Obstetrical analgesia:**  Historically used for pain relief during labor, its use is now largely avoided due to the potential for neonatal complications.
* **Preoperative medication (IV only):** Meperidine can be administered intravenously before surgery to provide sedation and pain relief.  However, other medications are generally preferred.

**Important Note:** The American Pain Society and other leading medical organizations do not recommend meperidine as a first-line analgesic due to safety concerns and the availability of superior alternatives. Its use should be reserved for very specific situations and under close medical supervision.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Doses must be individually adjusted based on the patient's response and tolerance. Oral administration is generally not recommended for acute or chronic pain.  If intravenous administration is required, a reduced dose should be considered.  Patients with prior opioid exposure might need higher initial doses.  The maximum daily dose should not exceed 600 mg.


* **Acute Pain (IM, Subcutaneous):** 50-150 mg every 3-4 hours as needed, for a maximum of 48 hours.
* **Obstetrical Analgesia (IM, Subcutaneous):** 50-100 mg when pain becomes regular, repeated at 1-3 hour intervals.
* **Preoperative Medication (IM, Subcutaneous):** 50-100 mg 30-90 minutes before anesthesia.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Dosage for children is weight-based and requires careful titration.  Oral administration is generally not recommended.

* **Acute Pain (IM, IV, Subcutaneous):** Infants ≤6 months: 0.2-0.25 mg/kg every 2-3 hours; Infants >6 months, children, and adolescents: 0.8-1 mg/kg every 2-3 hours (max 75mg/dose for <50kg; 50-75mg every 2-3 hours for ≥50kg).
* **Preoperative Analgesia (IM, IV, Subcutaneous, Oral):**  0.5-1 mg/kg 30-90 minutes before anesthesia (max 2 mg/kg or 150 mg).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal impairment significantly impacts meperidine metabolism, increasing the risk of toxicity.  Hepatic impairment also requires caution and slower dose titration.  Specific dosage adjustments are not consistently defined and should be determined on a case-by-case basis with careful monitoring.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Seizures (especially with high doses or renal impairment)
* Respiratory depression
* Hypotension
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Serotonin syndrome (when combined with serotonergic drugs)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Dependence and withdrawal symptoms with prolonged use


If any adverse effects occur, particularly serious ones, contact a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Meperidine is an opioid agonist. This means it binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), primarily in the brain and spinal cord.  This binding action inhibits the transmission of pain signals, resulting in pain relief and sedation.  It also affects other parts of the CNS, leading to the various side effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Meperidine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity, severe respiratory depression, severe asthma, bowel obstruction, and those using MAO inhibitors.
* **Drug Interactions:** Meperidine interacts significantly with other CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates),  serotonergic drugs, and certain medications affecting liver enzymes.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Meperidine is a pregnancy category C drug.  Use during pregnancy should be avoided whenever possible due to the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Meperidine is excreted in breast milk and can cause sedation in infants.
* **Elderly and Renal/Hepatic Impairment:**  Elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment are at significantly increased risk of adverse effects due to altered drug metabolism and clearance. Meperidine should be avoided whenever possible in these patients.
* **Risk of Addiction:** Meperidine is an opioid and carries a risk of dependence and addiction, particularly with prolonged use.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take meperidine with alcohol or other medications?** A: No,  avoid combining meperidine with alcohol, other CNS depressants, or certain other medications without consulting a healthcare provider.  Dangerous interactions can occur.

* **Q: How should I store meperidine?** A: Store meperidine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How long does it take for meperidine to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration.  Intravenous administration is the fastest, while oral administration is slower.

* **Q: Can I stop taking meperidine suddenly?** A:  Do not stop taking meperidine suddenly without consulting your healthcare provider.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.

* **Q: Is meperidine habit-forming?** A: Yes, meperidine is an opioid and has the potential for addiction and abuse.  Use should be strictly as prescribed.
