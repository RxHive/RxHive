# Manganese
### Generic Name
Manganese

### Usage

Manganese is an essential trace mineral crucial for various bodily functions.  Its primary use is in parenteral nutrition (PN), where it's added to intravenous solutions to prevent manganese deficiency, a condition that can arise when individuals receive nutrition solely through intravenous means. Manganese deficiency can lead to a range of issues, impacting bone health, wound healing, and potentially even neurological function.  Oral manganese supplements are also available to address dietary deficiencies, though these are less common than PN applications.  While not a primary use, manganese plays a role in several metabolic processes, impacting cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis and mucopolysaccharide production.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (oral vs. intravenous) and the individual's age, health status, and reason for supplementation.  Consult the following guidelines, remembering that these are for informational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice:


**Adults (Oral):**

* The recommended dietary intake (RDI) varies by gender and life stage.  For adult males over 18, it's 2.3 mg/day; for females over 18, it's 1.8 mg/day.  These figures increase during pregnancy (2 mg/day) and lactation (2.6 mg/day).


**Adults (Intravenous - Parenteral Nutrition):**

* Maintenance requirements are typically in the range of 150-800 mcg/day. However, expert opinion increasingly favors lower doses (60-100 mcg/day) to minimize the risk of neurotoxicity, especially in patients with liver conditions like cholestatic jaundice.  Achieving these lower doses can be challenging with currently available intravenous manganese formulations.


**Children (Oral):**

*  The RDI for children varies greatly with age, ranging from 0.003 mg/day for infants (0-6 months) to 1.9 mg/day for boys aged 9-13 years.  Refer to specific pediatric guidelines for precise age-based recommendations.


**Children (Intravenous - Parenteral Nutrition):**

*  Maintenance requirements are typically in the range of 2-10 mcg/kg/day.  As with adults,  expert opinion leans toward lower doses (1 mcg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 50 mcg/day) to reduce the risk of toxicity, but this can be difficult to achieve with current formulations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use caution and consider reducing or withholding manganese in patients with elevated bilirubin or cholestatic liver disease.
* **Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution; intravenous manganese chloride solutions may contain aluminum, which can accumulate to toxic levels in individuals with kidney problems.


**Administration:** Oral manganese supplements can typically be taken with food. Intravenous manganese must be administered according to strict guidelines by trained healthcare professionals.  Intravenous manganese should not be given as an intramuscular injection or a direct intravenous bolus due to the solution's acidic pH and hypotonic nature.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally not reported at recommended dosages, but excessive intake can lead to adverse effects.  


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Manganese toxicity is rare at recommended doses but can present with neurological symptoms.  These include:

* Parkinsonism-like symptoms (tremors, rigidity)
* Psychiatric disturbances
* Liver problems

**Note:** If any adverse effects occur, immediately consult a healthcare professional.


### How it Works

Manganese acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in vital metabolic processes.  Its role in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the liver, and its influence on mucopolysaccharide production, highlight its importance in maintaining overall health and normal physiological functions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** No specific contraindications are universally recognized, but individual patient factors must be considered.
* **Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications are not widely documented, but caution is advised, particularly in individuals taking multiple medications.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Manganese is considered a Category C medication during pregnancy, meaning the risks to the fetus are not fully established. It is excreted in breast milk.
* **Specific Populations:**  Premature newborns are particularly vulnerable to aluminum toxicity from some intravenous manganese solutions due to their immature renal function.  Older adults and those with liver or kidney disease may require dosage adjustments.
* **Aluminum Content:**  Some intravenous manganese solutions contain aluminum; high doses or prolonged use can lead to aluminum toxicity, particularly in those with renal impairment.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take manganese supplements without a doctor's recommendation?**  A: While manganese is essential, exceeding recommended levels can be harmful. Consult your doctor to determine if supplementation is necessary and appropriate for you.

* **Q: How should I store manganese supplements?** A: Store oral supplements as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: Are there any food sources of manganese?** A: Yes, many foods contain manganese, including nuts, seeds, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables. A balanced diet usually provides adequate amounts.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose of my manganese supplement?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Is manganese safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use should only be undertaken under the guidance of a healthcare professional to monitor for any potential side effects and adjust dosage as needed.
