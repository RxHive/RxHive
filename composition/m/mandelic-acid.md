# Mandelic Acid
### Generic Name
Mandelic Acid

### Usage

Mandelic acid has two primary uses:

1. **Treatment of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** Historically, mandelic acid (often as its ammonium or calcium salt) was administered orally to treat UTIs.  Its effectiveness stems from its ability to acidify urine, creating an environment less hospitable to bacteria.  This use is less common now due to the availability of more effective antibiotics.

2. **Topical Treatment of Acne:**  Currently, mandelic acid finds more widespread use as a topical treatment for acne. It's a key ingredient in many chemical peels and skincare products.  It works by exfoliating the skin, removing dead skin cells that can clog pores and contribute to acne breakouts. This action also helps to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of blemishes.  It's often used in conjunction with other alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) for enhanced effectiveness.  A 1% solution is also used as a flushing solution for maintaining indwelling urinary catheters to prevent bacterial colonization.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use:

* **Oral Use (for UTIs –  Historically used, not commonly prescribed now):**  Dosage and duration were determined by a physician based on the individual's condition and response.  It's crucial to emphasize that this route of administration is largely outdated for UTI treatment.

* **Topical Use (for Acne):**  Concentration and application frequency depend on the specific product and individual skin sensitivity.  Products typically range from 5% to 10% mandelic acid.  They are usually applied once or twice daily, as directed on the product label.  Always perform a patch test before applying to the entire face to check for any adverse reaction.

* **Urinary Catheter Flushing:** A 1% solution is used for irrigation.  The specific volume and frequency are determined by medical professionals based on the catheter type and patient needs.


### Side Effects

* **Topical Application:**
    * Mild stinging or burning sensation upon application (especially initially)
    * Redness or irritation
    * Dryness or peeling of the skin
    * Increased sun sensitivity (requires the use of sunscreen)
    * Rare cases of allergic reactions

* **Oral Administration (Historically used, not recommended currently):**
    * Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
    * Crystallization in the urine (potentially leading to kidney stones – this was a significant concern with higher doses)

* **Serious Side Effects (Rare but warrant immediate medical attention):** Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), kidney problems.


### How it Works

* **Antibacterial Action (in UTIs):** Mandelic acid acidifies the urine, lowering its pH. This acidic environment inhibits the growth of many bacteria that thrive in alkaline conditions, thus helping to clear UTIs.

* **Exfoliating Action (in Acne):** Mandelic acid is an AHA.  It gently dissolves the bonds between dead skin cells, facilitating their removal. This process promotes cell turnover, unclogs pores, and reduces acne breakouts.  Its larger molecular size compared to other AHAs like glycolic acid, makes it gentler on the skin, reducing the risk of irritation.


### Precautions

* **Topical Use:**  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Use sunscreen daily when using mandelic acid topically. Perform a patch test before full application.  Those with very sensitive skin may experience increased irritation.

* **Oral Use (Not commonly used):**  Due to the risk of kidney stones, and the availability of safer and more effective antibiotics for UTIs, oral use is not recommended.  Consult a physician before considering this route of administration.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of topical mandelic acid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Consult a doctor or healthcare professional before use.

* **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are commonly reported with topical use.  For oral use (which is rare), consult a physician to check for potential drug interactions.

* **Kidney Disease:** Individuals with kidney problems should exercise extra caution, as mandelic acid can potentially contribute to kidney stone formation.  This is primarily relevant to oral use.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use mandelic acid every day?** A: For topical use, follow the instructions on the product label.  Daily use is common but depends on the product concentration and individual tolerance.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results with mandelic acid for acne?** A:  Results vary, but improvements in skin texture and acne reduction can often be seen within several weeks of consistent use.

* **Q: Does mandelic acid cause sun sensitivity?** A: Yes, mandelic acid can increase sun sensitivity. It's essential to use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher during the day when using mandelic acid topically.

* **Q: How should I store mandelic acid products?** A: Store them according to the product label instructions, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: Can I use mandelic acid with other skincare products?** A:  It's best to introduce mandelic acid into your routine gradually. Check the product label for compatibility with other skincare products.  Consult with a dermatologist or skincare professional if you have concerns about using it with other treatments.
