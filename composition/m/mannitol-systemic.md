# Mannitol (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Mannitol (Systemic)

### Usage
Mannitol is a type of osmotic diuretic primarily used to reduce elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) associated with cerebral edema (brain swelling) and/or increased brain mass.  It achieves this by drawing fluid from the brain tissue into the bloodstream, which is then excreted through the kidneys.  This helps alleviate pressure on the brain.  It's also used to lower elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), the pressure inside the eye, often before eye surgery or in cases of traumatic hyphema (bleeding in the front chamber of the eye).  Additionally, mannitol finds application in kidney transplant procedures, both for the donor (before kidney removal) and recipient (before revascularization), and as an irrigation solution during certain transurethral surgical procedures (like transurethral prostatic resection).  Finally, it can be used off-label to enhance the excretion of certain toxins from the body, such as salicylates, barbiturates, bromides, and lithium.

### Dosage
Mannitol dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (typically intravenous, IV).  The information below is for guidance only and should not replace the advice of a healthcare professional.  They will determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs.


**Adults:**

* **Reduction of Intraocular Pressure (IOP):**  1.5-2 g/kg administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes, 1-1.5 hours before surgery.  For traumatic hyphema with IOP > 35 mmHg, 1.5 g/kg IV over 45 minutes, twice daily (BID), or every 8 hours for extremely high pressure.
* **Kidney Transplant (Donor):** 12.5 g IV (with adequate hydration) before nephrectomy; may be repeated.  (Recipient): 50 g IV before kidney revascularization.
* **Transurethral Irrigation:** 5% solution used as needed.
* **Reduction of Intracranial Pressure (off-label):** 0.25-1 g/kg/dose IV; may be repeated every 6-8 hours as needed.
* **Enhancement of Toxin Excretion:** 50-200 g as a 5-25% solution IV, at a rate to maintain urine output of 100-500 mL/hour.  Maximum recommended dose: 200 g.


**Children:** Dosages are generally calculated based on weight (g/kg) or body surface area (BSA, g/mÂ²). Specific pediatric dosages for acute renal failure, reduced intracranial pressure, and reduced intraocular pressure are detailed in the original provided data, and should be determined by a pediatrician or qualified physician.   Always follow the instructions given by a healthcare professional.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Chills
* Fluid and electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hyponatremia)

Less common but potentially serious side effects:

* Dehydration
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Cardiac failure
* Acute renal failure
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Mannitol works by creating an osmotic gradient.  It's a sugar alcohol that isn't readily reabsorbed by the kidneys. When administered intravenously, it increases the osmotic pressure in the blood, drawing fluid from tissues (like the brain or eye) into the bloodstream. This excess fluid is then eliminated through increased urine production (diuresis).  In the brain, this reduction in fluid volume decreases ICP.  In the eye, it lowers IOP.  The mechanism in toxin excretion is similar; mannitol increases urine flow, carrying the toxins out of the body.

### Precautions
Mannitol is contraindicated in patients with:

* Severe renal impairment
* Anuria (absence of urine production)
* Severe dehydration
* Severe pulmonary edema
* Hypersensitivity to mannitol
* Active intracranial bleeding (except during craniotomy)
* Severe hypovolemia
* Progressive heart failure or congestive heart failure

Use caution in patients with:

* Cardiopulmonary or renal dysfunction
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Patients taking other nephrotoxic medications
* Pre-existing renal disease or sepsis.
* Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss use with a doctor.


It's crucial to monitor fluid and electrolyte levels during mannitol therapy.  Interactions with other medications are possible; always inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take mannitol without a prescription?** A: No. Mannitol is a prescription medication and should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How is mannitol stored?** A: Store mannitol as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider for guidance; do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is mannitol safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** A:  Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with a doctor as it carries potential risks.
* **Q: Are there long-term effects associated with mannitol use?** A: Long-term effects are generally rare with appropriate use and monitoring, but potential long-term issues related to renal function or electrolyte imbalances should be discussed with your doctor.
