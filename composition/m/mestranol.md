# Mestranol
### Generic Name
Mestranol

### Usage
Mestranol is a synthetic estrogen that's not used as a standalone medication.  It's always combined with a progestin in oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills).  Its primary use is in these combination oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy.  While it has been historically used in menopausal hormone therapy and the treatment of menstrual disorders, these uses are now less common due to safer and more effective alternatives.  The combination with progestin is crucial; mestranol alone is ineffective and not prescribed.

### Dosage
Mestranol dosage is always determined as part of a combination oral contraceptive, and varies significantly depending on the specific formulation of the pill.  The combined pill contains varying doses of both mestranol and the progestin.  Dosage instructions are explicitly given on the packaging of each specific brand and should be followed precisely.  There is no single recommended dosage for mestranol because it's always administered with a progestin in a carefully balanced combination.  Self-adjusting the dose is dangerous and should never be attempted.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist for correct dosage information related to a specific brand of oral contraceptive.

### Side Effects
Common side effects associated with combination oral contraceptives containing mestranol can include:

*   Breast tenderness
*   Nausea
*   Headaches
*   Weight changes
*   Mood changes
*   Spotting or breakthrough bleeding
*   Changes in libido

Less common, but serious side effects, require immediate medical attention and can include:

*   Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
*   Stroke
*   Heart attack
*   High blood pressure
*   Liver problems
*   Gallbladder disease


If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.  This is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences can vary.

### How it Works
Mestranol, in combination with a progestin, works primarily by preventing ovulation.  It achieves this by suppressing the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland.  These hormones are essential for the maturation and release of an egg from the ovary.  The reduced levels of FSH and LH inhibit the development of follicles and prevent ovulation.  Additionally, mestranol and the progestin alter cervical mucus, making it thicker and less permeable to sperm, thereby further hindering fertilization.  Changes in the uterine lining also occur, making implantation less likely, even if fertilization occurs.

### Precautions
Mestranol-containing oral contraceptives are contraindicated in individuals with certain conditions, including:

*   A history of blood clots
*   Stroke or heart attack
*   Breast cancer or other estrogen-sensitive cancers
*   Liver disease
*   Migraines with aura
*   Uncontrolled high blood pressure
*   Pregnancy or breastfeeding


Interactions with other drugs are possible.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Special caution is advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women, older adults, and individuals with underlying health conditions.  Smoking significantly increases the risk of serious adverse effects when using oral contraceptives.
