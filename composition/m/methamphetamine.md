# Methamphetamine
### Generic Name
Methamphetamine

### Usage
Methamphetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant primarily used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children over 6 years of age.  It's a component of a comprehensive treatment program including psychological, educational, and social interventions.  It's also used short-term (a few weeks) for exogenous obesity as an adjunct to calorie restriction in individuals unresponsive to other weight-loss methods.  Note that the use of methamphetamine for narcolepsy is considered off-label.  It's crucial to understand that methamphetamine is a controlled substance with a high potential for abuse and should only be obtained and used under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Exogenous Obesity (Short-Term):**  5 mg orally every 8 hours, taken half an hour before meals. Treatment should not exceed a few weeks.
* **Narcolepsy (Off-Label):** 20-60 mg orally within one hour of waking.

**Pediatric Dosage (ADHD):**

* Children ≥6 years and adolescents: Initial dose is 5 mg once or twice daily. The dose can be increased by 5 mg weekly until the optimal response is achieved. The usual effective dose ranges from 20-25 mg daily, given once or twice daily.  The lowest effective dose should always be used. The first dose should be administered in the early morning to avoid sleep disturbances.

**Pediatric Dosage (Exogenous Obesity):**

* Children ≥12 years: Same as the adult dose.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for individualized dosing based on a patient's specific needs and health status.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nervous system: Dizziness, insomnia, headache, restlessness, overstimulation, euphoria, dysphoria, exacerbation of tics (in those with Tourette's or similar conditions), psychotic symptoms, drug dependence (with prolonged use).
* Cardiovascular: Increased blood pressure, palpitations, tachycardia.
* Gastrointestinal:  Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, unpleasant taste, dry mouth.
* Endocrine and Metabolic: Changes in libido, growth suppression in children.
* Dermatological:  Alopecia (hair loss), urticaria (hives).
* Genitourinary: Frequent erections, impotence, prolonged erections.
* Neuromuscular and Skeletal: Tremor, rhabdomyolysis (serious muscle breakdown).

Serious, but less common side effects are possible.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning adverse effects.

### How it Works
Methamphetamine is a stimulant that affects the brain's neurotransmitters.  It increases the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, leading to increased alertness, focus, and energy.  In ADHD, this helps improve attention and reduce hyperactivity. In obesity, it can suppress appetite, contributing to weight loss. The exact mechanisms behind its effect on weight are not fully understood.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to methamphetamine or any component of the formulation; concomitant use of MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or within 14 days of their discontinuation; glaucoma; advanced arteriosclerosis; symptomatic cardiovascular disease; moderate-to-severe hypertension; hyperthyroidism; agitated states; history of drug abuse.
* **Warnings:**  Methamphetamine has a high potential for abuse and dependence.  It can cause serious cardiovascular events and even death with misuse.  Careful monitoring is crucial.
* **Interactions:** Methamphetamine can interact with many medications, including analgesics, antihistamines, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, MAOIs, and others.  It’s essential to inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Methamphetamine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. Use during pregnancy may increase the risk of premature birth, low birth weight, and neonatal withdrawal symptoms.  It's excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding inadvisable.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use caution in elderly patients, patients with pre-existing psychosis or bipolar disorder, patients with Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders, and those with cardiovascular conditions.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for methamphetamine to work?** A: The effects can be felt relatively quickly, but the full therapeutic effect may take longer to develop.
* **Q: Can I stop taking methamphetamine suddenly?** A: No, abrupt discontinuation, especially after high doses or prolonged use, can lead to withdrawal symptoms including fatigue, depression, and sleep disturbances.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
