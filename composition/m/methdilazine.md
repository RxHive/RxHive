# Methdilazine

**Generic Name:** Methdilazine

**Usage:**

Methdilazine is an antihistamine primarily used to relieve the symptoms of allergies.  These symptoms can include:

* Sneezing
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Hives (urticaria)
* Itching
* Skin rash


It's important to note that methdilazine is not typically a first-line treatment for allergies and is less commonly prescribed than newer antihistamines.  Its use is often reserved for situations where other antihistamines haven't been effective or are unsuitable for the patient.  It may also be used for sedation in some specific cases, although this is not a common or recommended use.  The prescribing physician will determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.

**Side Effects:**

Like all medications, methdilazine can cause side effects.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and nausea.
* **Less common but serious side effects:**  Difficulty urinating, rapid heartbeat, confusion, hallucinations (especially in elderly patients), seizures, and blood disorders.

**How it Works:**

Methdilazine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with allergies. By blocking histamine receptors, methdilazine reduces or prevents these symptoms.  It also possesses some sedative properties, contributing to its effect on allergic symptoms.

**FAQs:**

* **Is methdilazine habit-forming?** No, methdilazine is not considered habit-forming.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking methdilazine?**  Alcohol can increase the sedative effects of methdilazine, leading to increased drowsiness and impairment.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
* **Can I take methdilazine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** If you experience any serious side effects, contact your doctor or seek medical attention immediately. For less serious side effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
* **Is methdilazine available over-the-counter?** No, methdilazine is typically only available with a prescription.
