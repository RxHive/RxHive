# Methdilazine
### Generic Name
Methdilazine

### Usage
Methdilazine is primarily used to relieve the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, mainly focusing on pruritic (itchy) skin disorders.  It's an antihistamine, meaning it works by counteracting the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions.  While its primary use is for itchy skin conditions, it might offer symptomatic relief in other hypersensitivity situations, though this isn't always its first-line treatment.  Always consult a doctor to determine if methdilazine is the right treatment for your specific hypersensitivity reaction.

### Dosage

**Adults:** For pruritic skin disorders and hypersensitivity reactions, the typical oral dosage is 8-16 mg twice daily (BID).

**Children:**
* Ages 3-6 years: 0.3 mg/kg/day, with a maximum daily dose of 8 mg.
* Ages 6-12 years: 4 mg twice daily (BID).

Dosage adjustments for specific age groups, weight, or severity of condition aren't explicitly established in available information and should be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs.  The information provided is for general guidance only.  Methdilazine is typically administered orally (in tablet or syrup form), but other routes of administration are not mentioned in the provided data.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding the correct dosage and method of administration.

### How it Works

Methdilazine is an antihistamine that works by binding to histamine H1 receptors.  Histamine H1 receptors are found on various cells throughout the body, including those in the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract. By blocking these receptors, methdilazine prevents histamine from binding and triggering its effects.  Histamine is a key player in allergic reactions, causing symptoms like itching, swelling, and inflammation. By inhibiting histamine's action, methdilazine provides relief from these symptoms.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Methdilazine is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or similar medications, hepatic or renal impairment, concurrent use with MAO inhibitors, urinary or gastric obstruction, increased ocular pressure, enlarged prostate, Reye's syndrome, epilepsy, jaundice, cardiac or blood disorders, or paralytic ileus.  It should also be avoided in neonates and premature infants.

**Warnings:** Use with caution in pregnancy and lactation, patients with urinary retention, peptic ulcers, Parkinson's disease, gastrointestinal obstruction, elderly patients, those operating machinery or driving, and individuals with asthma.

**Drug Interactions:** Methdilazine can potentiate the CNS depressant effects of barbiturates, hypnotics, opioid analgesics, sedatives, and neuroleptics. It can also increase the antimuscarinic effects of MAO inhibitors, atropine, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).  Furthermore, it may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa.  Avoid concurrent use of these medications unless specifically directed by your doctor.
