# Measles Vaccine Live + Rubella vaccine Live
### Generic Name
Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine, Live

### Usage
The MMR vaccine is used to protect against three viral infections: measles, mumps, and rubella.  Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause fever, cough, runny nose, and a characteristic rash.  Mumps causes swollen salivary glands, fever, and headache. Rubella, also known as German measles, is generally milder but can cause serious complications during pregnancy, including birth defects or miscarriage.  The primary use of the MMR vaccine is to prevent these diseases, significantly reducing their incidence and preventing outbreaks. There are no secondary uses beyond this primary preventative function.


### Dosage
The MMR vaccine is typically administered as a two-dose series.  

* **First Dose:** Recommended at 12-15 months of age.
* **Second Dose:**  Recommended at 4-6 years of age (before starting school).

**Administration:** The vaccine is given as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin) in the upper arm or thigh.  

**Variations:** The dosage is generally the same for both children and adults.  However, individuals with compromised immune systems might require a different vaccination schedule or approach, which should be determined by a healthcare professional.  There is no oral form of the MMR vaccine.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and temporary and include:

* Mild fever
* Rash
* Soreness or redness at the injection site
* Swelling of the glands
* Joint pain (more common in adolescent girls and women)

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur, although they are rare:

* Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) - characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, hives.
* Thrombocytopenic purpura (low platelet count)
* Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)

**Important:** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any severe allergic reaction or other concerning side effects after receiving the MMR vaccine.


### How it Works
The MMR vaccine contains live, weakened (attenuated) viruses.  When administered, these weakened viruses trigger an immune response in the body without causing illness. The body produces antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella, providing immunity against future infection.  This immunity typically lasts for many years, hence the recommendation for a second dose to ensure long-term protection.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** The MMR vaccine should not be given to individuals with severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine, including neomycin.  It's also contraindicated for individuals with severely weakened immune systems (e.g., due to cancer treatment, HIV/AIDS) or those who are pregnant.  Pregnant women should postpone vaccination until after delivery.
* **Interactions:**  There are no major known drug interactions, but it's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking before receiving the MMR vaccine.
* **Warnings:** Inform your doctor if you have a history of seizures or any neurological conditions.  Individuals with a history of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or bleeding disorders should discuss vaccination with their healthcare provider.


### FAQs
* **Q: Can I get measles, mumps, or rubella from the MMR vaccine?** A:  The viruses in the MMR vaccine are weakened and generally cannot cause illness.  A very mild, temporary rash or fever is possible in rare instances, but this is not the actual disease.
* **Q:  How long does the MMR vaccine protect me?** A:  Most individuals remain protected for many years after two doses.  However, immunity can wane over time, so booster doses might be recommended in specific circumstances as determined by a healthcare provider.
* **Q: Is the MMR vaccine safe?** A:  Extensive research shows the MMR vaccine to be very safe and effective. The risks of contracting measles, mumps, or rubella are far greater than the risks associated with the vaccine.
* **Q: How should I store the MMR vaccine?** A: The MMR vaccine must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated at a specific temperature.  Do not freeze.
