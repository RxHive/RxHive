# Measles Vaccine Live + Rubella vaccine Live

**Generic Name:** Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine, Live Virus

**Usage:**

The MMR vaccine is used to protect against three viral infections: measles, mumps, and rubella.  It's typically given as a two-dose series.  The first dose is usually administered between 12 and 15 months of age, and the second dose is given between 4 and 6 years of age, before kindergarten or school entry.  The vaccine is also recommended for adults who lack immunity, particularly women of childbearing age.  Specific recommendations may vary depending on individual health history and risk factors.  It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate vaccination schedule and whether the vaccine is right for you.


**Side Effects:**

Most side effects are mild and temporary.  Common side effects include:

* **Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site:** This is the most common side effect.
* **Fever:** Low-grade fever is possible.
* **Rash:** A mild rash may develop a few days after vaccination.
* **Mild tiredness or irritability:** These symptoms are usually short-lived.

Rare but more serious side effects can occur, including:

* **Severe allergic reactions:** These are rare but can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.  Signs include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, and hives.
* **Seizures:**  While rare, seizures can occur, particularly in children with a history of seizures or neurological conditions.
* **Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count):** This is a rare complication.
* **Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain):** This is a very rare but serious complication.

It's important to note that the risk of these serious side effects is significantly lower than the risk of contracting measles, mumps, or rubella.


**How it Works:**

The MMR vaccine contains live, attenuated (weakened) viruses of measles, mumps, and rubella.  After vaccination, the weakened viruses replicate in the body, triggering an immune response.  This response produces antibodies that protect against future infection with these viruses.  The vaccine does *not* cause measles, mumps, or rubella.


**FAQs:**

* **Is the MMR vaccine safe?** Yes, the MMR vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines available.  Extensive research has shown its safety and efficacy.
* **Can I get measles, mumps, or rubella from the MMR vaccine?**  While the vaccine contains live viruses, they are significantly weakened and cannot cause disease in healthy individuals.  A very mild, temporary rash may occur, but this is not the same as the actual disease.
* **What if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  The MMR vaccine is generally not recommended during pregnancy.  Consult your healthcare provider.  Breastfeeding is not a contraindication to receiving the MMR vaccine.
* **What if I've already had measles, mumps, or rubella?**  You likely already have immunity, but your doctor may still recommend vaccination depending on your specific circumstances and the availability of reliable proof of prior infection.
* **Are there any interactions with other medications?**  There are limited known drug interactions, but it's important to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.  Those with compromised immune systems should discuss with their doctor before receiving the vaccine.
* **What if I experience a severe reaction?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience a severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling, hives).
