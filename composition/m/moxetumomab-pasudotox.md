# Moxetumomab pasudotox
### Generic Name
Moxetumomab pasudotox

### Usage
Moxetumomab pasudotox is a medication used to treat relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in adults.  "Relapsed" means the leukemia has returned after a period of remission, and "refractory" means it hasn't responded to previous treatments.  This drug is specifically indicated for patients who have already received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analog (PNA).  It's a targeted therapy, meaning it focuses on specific leukemia cells, minimizing harm to healthy cells.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Moxetumomab pasudotox is administered intravenously (IV). The dosage is calculated based on the patient's actual body weight *before* the first dose of the first treatment cycle.  The dose is 0.04 mg/kg given on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 28-day treatment cycle.  Treatment continues for a maximum of six cycles, or until the disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  Weight changes greater than 10% between cycles may necessitate dose adjustment; however, dose adjustments are *not* made within a cycle.  The drug is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 29 mL/min).

**Important Considerations for Administration:**

* **Premedication:**  Before each infusion, patients receive premedications including an antihistamine (like hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine), an antipyretic (acetaminophen), and a histamine H2-receptor antagonist (like famotidine or cimetidine) 30-90 minutes prior.
* **Hydration:**  Before and after each infusion, patients receive 1 liter (500 mL for patients <50 kg) of isotonic IV fluids over 2-4 hours.  They also need to drink plenty of fluids (up to 3 liters per day, or 2 liters for those under 50kg) for days 1 through 8 of each cycle to prevent dehydration.  Fluid balance and serum electrolyte levels must be monitored closely to prevent overload or imbalances.
* **Post-infusion medication:** An oral corticosteroid (like dexamethasone 4 mg) is given to reduce nausea and vomiting, and oral antihistamines and antipyretics might be used for up to 24 hours after the infusion.
* **Thromboprophylaxis:**  Low-dose aspirin for days 1 through 8 of each cycle may be considered.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of moxetumomab pasudotox have not been established in children.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  Many patients experience side effects, even with proper administration.  These include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Peripheral edema
* Capillary leak syndrome
* Facial edema
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal distention
* Hypoalbuminemia
* Fluid retention
* Electrolyte disorders (hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperuricemia)
* Nephrotoxicity
* Decreased hemoglobin levels
* Neutropenia
* Anemia
* Decreased platelet count
* Increased liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, bilirubin, ALP)
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Infusion-related reactions
* Fever

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  These are less frequent but require immediate medical attention:

* Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)
* Severe capillary leak syndrome
* Acute renal failure
* Severe infusion reactions
* Other serious side effects (see full prescribing information)

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Moxetumomab pasudotox is a targeted therapy that works by binding to CD22, a protein found on the surface of certain B cells, including those implicated in hairy cell leukemia.  Once bound, it's taken into the cell. Inside the cell, it disrupts protein synthesis through ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2, eventually leading to the death of the targeted leukemia cells.

### Precautions

* **Renal Impairment:** Moxetumomab pasudotox is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤29 mL/min).  Careful monitoring of kidney function is crucial.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** While no dosage adjustments are specifically provided for mild to moderate hepatic impairment, close monitoring is still necessary.
* **Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS):** CLS is a serious risk. Patients need close monitoring for weight gain, blood pressure changes, and symptoms like edema and shortness of breath.  Treatment may be delayed or stopped if CLS develops.
* **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS):** HUS is another serious risk.  Monitoring blood counts and kidney function is essential, and treatment must be stopped if HUS develops.
* **Infusion Reactions:** Infusion reactions can occur. Premedication helps reduce this risk, but close monitoring during infusions is still necessary.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Moxetumomab pasudotox is expected to harm a developing fetus. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and after treatment. It's unknown if the drug passes into breast milk; the risks and benefits of breastfeeding should be carefully considered.
* **Interactions:** The drug may interact with other medications, so informing your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking is crucial.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may have a higher risk of adverse reactions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: Treatment typically lasts for up to six cycles, but it may be stopped sooner if the disease progresses or intolerable side effects occur.

* **Q: How is the drug stored?** A: Follow the specific storage instructions provided with your medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a dose.  Do not attempt to adjust the dosage yourself.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects?** A: While the common side effects are largely manageable, long-term effects should be discussed with your physician.  Regular monitoring is necessary.

* **Q: What if I experience severe side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects.

* **Q:  Is this a cure for HCL?** A: Moxetumomab pasudotox is a treatment for relapsed or refractory HCL, not a cure.  The goal is to manage the disease and improve the patient's quality of life.
