# Magaldrate + Simethicone

**Generic Name:** Magaldrate + Simethicone

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve the symptoms of heartburn, sour stomach, and acid indigestion.  Magaldrate is an antacid that neutralizes stomach acid, while simethicone helps to reduce gas and bloating. It's often used for short-term relief of these symptoms.  It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and not use it for prolonged periods without consulting a doctor.

**Side Effects:**  While generally considered safe when used as directed, side effects are relatively uncommon but can include:

* **Constipation:** This is a more common side effect, especially with prolonged use.
* **Diarrhea:** Less common than constipation.
* **Mild stomach upset:** Some individuals might experience mild discomfort in the stomach.
* **Magnesium overdose (rare but possible with high doses):**  Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and confusion.  This is more of a concern for individuals with kidney problems.
* **Aluminum accumulation (rare but possible with long-term use):** This is a greater concern for individuals with kidney impairment.


**How it Works:**

* **Magaldrate:** This is a combination of magnesium and aluminum hydroxide. It works by neutralizing stomach acid.  The magnesium component has a laxative effect, while the aluminum component has a constipating effect. The balance between these two usually results in a neutral bowel effect, although individual responses vary.

* **Simethicone:** This is an anti-foaming agent. It works by breaking up gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, helping to reduce bloating and gas.  It does not neutralize acid.
