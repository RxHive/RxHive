# Methimazole
### Generic Name
Methimazole

### Usage
Methimazole is an antithyroid medication primarily used to treat hyperthyroidism.  This condition occurs when the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, leading to symptoms like rapid heartbeat, weight loss, nervousness, and heat intolerance.  Methimazole works by interfering with the production of these hormones in the thyroid gland.

It's most commonly prescribed for Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter, conditions that cause hyperthyroidism.  Additionally, it's sometimes used to help control hyperthyroid symptoms before thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy) or radioactive iodine therapy.  In some cases, it may be used off-label for conditions such as iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis and amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly depending on the severity of hyperthyroidism and the specific condition being treated.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's instructions precisely.  Generally, initial daily doses range from 15mg to 60mg, divided into three doses, with subsequent adjustments based on the patient's response.  Maintenance doses are typically lower, ranging from 5mg to 15mg daily.  For Graves' disease, a lower initial dose might be used, with the goal of achieving a euthyroid state (normal thyroid hormone levels).  In thyrotoxic crisis, higher, more frequent doses may be necessary initially.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For children with hyperthyroidism, the initial dose is usually calculated based on weight (0.4mg/kg/day divided into three doses). Maintenance doses are typically lower (0.2mg/kg/day divided into three doses).

**Dosage Forms:** Methimazole is typically available as tablets for oral administration.

**Administration:** Methimazole tablets are usually taken orally, and can be taken with or without food.

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney impairment, although specific guidelines are not always provided.  Always consult a doctor for precise dosage instructions.

### Side Effects

Methimazole, like many medications, can cause side effects.  These can vary in severity and frequency.

* **Common:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, itching, and mild changes in liver function tests.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Agranulocytosis (severe reduction in white blood cells), aplastic anemia, hepatitis, jaundice, lupus-like syndrome, and vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels).  These are rare but require immediate medical attention.
* **Other Potential Side Effects:**  Alopecia (hair loss), goiter (enlarged thyroid), hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), and allergic reactions.

If any concerning side effects occur, such as fever, sore throat, unusual bleeding or bruising, yellowing of the skin or eyes, or severe skin reactions, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Methimazole works by preventing the thyroid gland from producing thyroid hormones. It does this by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). By blocking hormone production, methimazole helps to restore normal thyroid hormone levels in hyperthyroidism.  It's important to note that methimazole doesn't directly remove existing thyroid hormones from the body; it only prevents further production.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Methimazole should not be used by individuals with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components. Individuals with a history of acute pancreatitis after taking methimazole should also avoid it.

* **Drug Interactions:** Methimazole can interact with several other drugs. For example, it may increase the levels of eliglustat and decrease the effects of radioactive iodine. Consult with a doctor or pharmacist about any other medications being taken concurrently.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Methimazole is classified as a Category D drug during pregnancy, meaning it poses a potential risk to the developing fetus.  It's crucial to discuss the risks and benefits with a doctor before using methimazole during pregnancy.  It's also excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution during breastfeeding. The lowest effective dose is recommended, and infants should be monitored for growth and development.

* **Other Precautions:**  Individuals with liver or kidney problems, older adults, and those with a history of blood disorders should use methimazole with caution and under close medical supervision.  Regular blood tests may be necessary to monitor for side effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Methimazole to work?** A:  The effects of Methimazole are generally seen within a few weeks, but it may take several months to achieve full control of hyperthyroidism.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Methimazole suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking Methimazole suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden worsening of hyperthyroidism.  The medication should be tapered off gradually under medical supervision.
