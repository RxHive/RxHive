# Methimazole

**Generic Name:** Methimazole

**Usage:** Methimazole is used to treat hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).  This includes conditions like Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goiter. It works by reducing the production of thyroid hormones.  It may also be used before thyroid surgery to reduce the size and vascularity of the thyroid gland, making surgery safer.

**Side Effects:**  Methimazole, like other medications, can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Mild:**  Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, joint pain, skin rash, and itching.
* **Less Common but More Serious:**  Agranulocytosis (a serious drop in white blood cell count, increasing risk of infection), liver damage (jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, abdominal pain), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), and bone marrow suppression.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Lupus-like syndrome, vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels), hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid â€“ can occur after long-term use).


**How it Works:** Methimazole inhibits thyroid peroxidase, an enzyme crucial in the production of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) in the thyroid gland. By blocking this enzyme, it reduces the synthesis and release of these hormones, thereby controlling the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?**  It usually takes several weeks to see a significant improvement in symptoms.
* **How is it administered?** Methimazole is typically taken orally as a tablet.
* **Can I take it while pregnant or breastfeeding?** Methimazole use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally avoided if possible due to potential risks to the baby, particularly during the first trimester.  The risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed with a doctor.
* **What are the potential interactions with other medications?** Methimazole can interact with several medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners) and certain antibiotics.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **What are the signs of a serious side effect?**  If you experience a fever, sore throat, unusual bleeding or bruising, jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, severe rash, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention.
* **How long will I need to take it?** The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual and the severity of hyperthyroidism.  It can range from a few months to several years.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration.
* **Can I stop taking it suddenly?** No, stopping Methimazole abruptly can lead to a sudden surge in thyroid hormones and worsen symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for discontinuation.
