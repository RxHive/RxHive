# Methoxsalen (Topical)
### Generic Name
Methoxsalen (Topical)

### Usage
Methoxsalen topical is primarily used for the repigmentation of idiopathic vitiligo, a skin condition characterized by the loss of pigment in certain areas, resulting in white patches.  It's a treatment option when other methods haven't been successful.  It's crucial to understand that methoxsalen topical itself doesn't directly repigment the skin; it works in conjunction with exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light.  The combination triggers a process that stimulates melanin production, gradually restoring skin color.


### Dosage
**Vitiligo:**

* **Adults and Children â‰¥12 years:**  The usual dosage is a 1% methoxsalen lotion applied topically to the affected areas before UVA light exposure.  The frequency of application is typically no more than once a week and is carefully determined by the physician based on the individual's skin's response (erythema, or redness). Treatment is tailored to each patient and monitored closely.  Overuse can lead to severe sunburn-like reactions.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  A healthcare professional should always be consulted to determine the appropriate dosage in these cases.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Burning sensation of the skin
* Erythema (redness)
* Blistering
* Skin irritation

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible and warrant immediate medical attention.  These can include severe sunburn-like reactions and long-term risks discussed below.


### How it Works
Methoxsalen is a photosensitizing agent.  When applied to the skin and followed by exposure to UVA light, it interacts with DNA in skin cells. This interaction leads to inflammation and increased melanin production.  Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color.  The increased melanin production gradually repigments the affected areas.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Methoxsalen topical is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to psoralens (the class of compounds methoxsalen belongs to), or any component of the formulation; those with diseases associated with photosensitivity (such as albinism, lupus erythematosus, porphyria, and xeroderma pigmentosum); those with invasive skin cancer; those with a history of melanoma; and children under 12 years of age.

* **Warnings:** There is an increased risk of serious burns from ultraviolet radiation or sunlight (even through glass), cataracts, photosensitivity (avoid sun exposure for at least 8 hours after application), and skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and squamous cell carcinoma).

* **Use with Caution:**  Methoxsalen topical should be used with caution in patients with significant sun exposure due to their occupation;  patients with multiple basal-cell carcinomas or a history of basal cell carcinoma; breastfeeding women; and when used concurrently with other photosensitizing drugs.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of methoxsalen topical in pregnant women is not established. Its excretion in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The time it takes to see noticeable repigmentation varies greatly depending on the individual and the severity of the vitiligo. It can take several weeks or even months of consistent treatment.

* **Q:  Can I use other skincare products while using methoxsalen topical?** A:  It's essential to discuss this with your doctor. Some skincare products may interact with methoxsalen or increase photosensitivity.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not try to make up for a missed dose. Follow your doctor's instructions for the scheduled treatment.

* **Q: How should I store methoxsalen topical?** A: Store it according to the directions on the label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.

* **Q: Are there any long-term risks associated with using methoxsalen topical?** A: Yes, long-term use increases the risk of skin cancer, and therefore, close monitoring is crucial.
