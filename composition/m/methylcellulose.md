# Methylcellulose
### Generic Name
Methylcellulose

### Usage
Methylcellulose is primarily used as a bulk-forming laxative to relieve constipation.  It works by absorbing water in the intestines, increasing stool bulk and promoting bowel movements. While its primary use is for constipation, it's not typically used for chronic or severe constipation, which requires a different approach and medical consultation.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Constipation:**
    * **Caplets (500mg):** Two caplets as needed, up to six times per day, with 8 ounces (240 mL) of cold water.  The maximum daily dose is 12 caplets.
    * **Powder:** 2 grams (one heaping tablespoon) mixed in 8 ounces (240 mL) of cold water.  This can be taken as needed, up to three times per day.


**Children:**

* **Ages 6-11 years:**
    * **Caplets (500mg):** One caplet as needed, up to six times per day. The maximum daily dose is 6 caplets.
    * **Powder:** 1 gram (2.5 level teaspoons) mixed in 8 ounces (240 mL) of cold water.  The dose can be increased by 2.5 level teaspoons as needed, up to three times a day.
* **Ages 12 years and older:** Dosage is the same as for adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before altering the dosage based on individual health conditions.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Abdominal cramps
* Flatulence (gas)
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Impaction (in rare cases, if insufficient fluid is consumed)


Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms, stop taking Methylcellulose and seek medical attention immediately.

### How it Works

Methylcellulose is a fiber supplement that works by absorbing water in the intestines. This increases the bulk and softness of the stool, making it easier to pass. The increased bulk also stimulates the natural contractions of the intestines (peristalsis), helping to move the stool through the digestive system.  It is important to note that Methylcellulose itself is not absorbed into the bloodstream.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methylcellulose should not be used by individuals with signs of appendicitis, undiagnosed abdominal pain, partial bowel obstruction, or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).
* **Warnings:**  Always take Methylcellulose with at least 8 ounces of water or other liquid. Failure to do so can lead to swelling of the medication in the throat or esophagus, potentially causing choking.
* **Interactions:** While generally well-tolerated, interactions with other medications are possible.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Methylcellulose is generally considered safe for occasional constipation during pregnancy when taken with adequate fluids.  Because it's not absorbed systemically, it's unlikely to pose a risk during breastfeeding. However, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional before taking any medication while pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Children and Older Adults:**  Children should only take Methylcellulose under the guidance of a physician.  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and should carefully follow dosage instructions and consult their doctor.
