# Menotropins (FSH+LH)
### Generic Name
Menotropins (FSH+LH)

### Usage
Menotropins is a combination of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), used primarily to stimulate the growth and maturation of follicles in women who are ovulating and experiencing infertility.  Its main use is in ovulation induction, helping women produce eggs for fertilization.  It's also used in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to improve the chances of successful egg retrieval.  Off-label, menotropins has been used in some cases to treat male infertility by stimulating spermatogenesis (sperm production).

### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly based on the individual's condition and response to treatment and whether it's being administered via intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection.  Precise dosage should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional.  The following are examples of dosing regimens and should not be considered a prescription:


**Ovulation Induction:**

*   **IM/SubQ:** Typically starts at 150 IU for the first 5 days.  The dose may be adjusted (up to 75-150 IU increments, not more frequently than every 2 days), with a maximum of 450 IU per dose and a maximum treatment duration of 12 days.  Once satisfactory follicular development is observed,  5000-10000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is administered one day after the last dose of menotropins.  Treatment may be repeated if necessary.

**Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART):**

*   **SubQ:**  An initial dose of 225 IU daily may be used (starting on day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle, usually after GnRH agonist suppression).  Dosage adjustments are based on ultrasound monitoring of ovarian response and serum estradiol levels (not more frequently than every 2 days and not exceeding 150 IU per adjustment). The maximum daily dose is 450 IU, and treatment should not exceed 20 days.
* **IM/SubQ:** An initial dose of 225 IU daily may be used. Adjustments are made based on ultrasound and estradiol levels, not more frequently than every 2 days and not exceeding 75-150 IU per adjustment. The maximum daily dose is 450 IU, and treatment should not exceed 12 days. hCG is administered following the last dose if a satisfactory response is noted.

**Spermatogenesis (Off-label use):**

*   **IM:** After pretreatment with hCG, 75 IU of menotropins three times per week is administered alongside twice-weekly hCG until sperm is detected in the ejaculate (4-6 months). If the response is insufficient after 6 months, the menotropins dosage might be increased to 150 IU three times weekly for another 6 months.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and efficacy of menotropins in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Menotropins can cause various side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  The frequency varies depending on the dosage and individual response.

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Multiple gestation (twins, triplets, etc.)
*   Headache
*   Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
*   Ovarian enlargement
*   Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, inflammation)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) â€“ a potentially life-threatening condition.
*   Ectopic pregnancy
*   Thromboembolism (blood clots)
*   Ovarian torsion (twisting of the ovary)
*   Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)

**If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**


### How it Works
Menotropins contains FSH and LH, hormones naturally produced by the pituitary gland.  FSH stimulates the growth and development of follicles in the ovaries (in females), where eggs mature. LH triggers ovulation, the release of the mature egg from the follicle. In males, FSH and LH are essential for spermatogenesis in the testes.  By supplementing these hormones, menotropins aims to correct hormonal imbalances that cause infertility.

### Precautions
Menotropins is contraindicated in several situations, including:

*   Hypersensitivity to menotropins or its components.
*   Primary ovarian failure (high FSH levels).
*   Pregnancy.
*   Uncontrolled endocrine disorders (thyroid, adrenal, pituitary).
*   Sex hormone-dependent tumors.
*   Pituitary or hypothalamic tumors.
*   Unexplained abnormal uterine bleeding.
*   Unexplained ovarian cysts or enlargement.

**Important Warnings:**

*   Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a significant risk, especially with higher doses.
*   Multiple pregnancies are more likely with menotropins use.
*   There is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, miscarriages, and birth defects.
*   Close monitoring of ovarian response through ultrasound and hormone level checks is essential.

Women should be fully informed about the risks and benefits before starting menotropins therapy.

### FAQs

**Q: How is menotropins stored?** Follow the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigeration.

**Q: How long does treatment typically last?**  The duration varies greatly depending on individual response and treatment goals, ranging from several days to several weeks.

**Q:  What are the signs of OHSS?**  OHSS symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, and shortness of breath. Severe OHSS can be life-threatening.

**Q:  Can I get pregnant while using menotropins?** Yes, that's the goal of the treatment for ovulation induction.  However, the chance of a multiple pregnancy is elevated.

**Q: Can I breastfeed while using menotropins?** No,  menotropins is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses risks to the developing fetus, and it's excreted in breast milk. Discuss this with your doctor.

**Q:  Are there any alternative treatments?**  Several other fertility treatments exist, and your doctor will help determine the most suitable approach.
