# Metformin + Vildagliptin
### Generic Name: Metformin + Vildagliptin

This combination medication is not typically available as a single generic product.  Metformin and vildagliptin are often prescribed separately or in a branded combination product. This information covers the individual components and their combined effects.


### Usage

**Metformin:** This is a biguanide used primarily to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity in muscle cells, thus helping to lower blood sugar levels.  It's often a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, especially in overweight or obese individuals.

**Vildagliptin:** This is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, another class of medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by increasing levels of incretins, hormones that stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon (a hormone that raises blood sugar). This leads to improved blood sugar control.

**Combined Use:**  The combination of metformin and vildagliptin is used when metformin alone doesn't provide sufficient blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The combination leverages the different mechanisms of action of each drug to achieve a greater reduction in blood glucose levels than either drug alone.


### Dosage

Dosage for both metformin and vildagliptin is determined individually by a healthcare professional based on factors including overall health, other medications, and response to treatment. There isn't a single "generic" dosage for the combination.

**Metformin:**  Dosages typically start low and are gradually increased. It's available in tablets and extended-release tablets.  Dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation and individual patient needs. It’s crucial to follow your doctor’s prescribed dosage and schedule precisely.

**Vildagliptin:** This medication comes in tablet form.  Dosage also varies by individual need and is determined by a physician.

**Important Note:**  Never adjust your dosage or start or stop taking these medications without consulting your doctor.


### Side Effects

**Metformin:**
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach cramps
* Metallic taste in the mouth
* Lactic acidosis (rare but serious)

**Vildagliptin:**
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea

**Serious but less common side effects for both:**  Consult your doctor immediately if you experience any severe allergic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), unusual muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine (may indicate lactic acidosis).

Note that this is not an exhaustive list.  Individual experiences vary.


### How it Works

As described above, metformin reduces glucose production by the liver and improves insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue. Vildagliptin works by enhancing the body's natural insulin-producing mechanisms via incretins.  Used together, they synergistically control blood glucose levels more effectively.


### Precautions

* **Metformin:**  Should be used with caution in patients with kidney problems, liver disease, heart failure, or a history of alcohol abuse.  It can increase the risk of lactic acidosis (a serious metabolic condition).
* **Vildagliptin:**  Use with caution in patients with moderate or severe kidney disease or a history of pancreatitis.  It should be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure.
* **Interactions:**  Both medications can interact with other drugs.  Inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using either medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
