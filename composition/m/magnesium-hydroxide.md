# Magnesium Hydroxide
### Generic Name
Magnesium Hydroxide

### Usage
Magnesium hydroxide is primarily used as an antacid to relieve symptoms associated with excess stomach acid, such as heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach.  It neutralizes stomach acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid, thus providing relief from these uncomfortable symptoms.  Additionally, it's used as a laxative for occasional constipation relief.  It achieves this laxative effect by drawing water into the intestines, softening stool and stimulating bowel movements.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **For heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach:**
    * Liquid (400 mg/5 mL): 5-15 mL as needed, up to four times a day.  Do not exceed 60 mL in 24 hours.
    * Tablets: 1-2.5 grams per day, in divided doses as needed.
* **For occasional constipation (laxative use):**
    * Liquid (400 mg/5 mL): 30-60 mL once daily at bedtime.
    * Liquid (800 mg/5 mL): 15-30 mL once daily at bedtime.
    * Liquid (1200 mg/5 mL): 10-20 mL once daily at bedtime or in divided doses.
    * Tablets: 1-2 grams per day, in one or two divided doses as needed.


**Children:**  (Dosage is expressed as milligrams of magnesium hydroxide. Always follow the instructions on the specific product label for your child's age.)

* **Heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach (Children 12 years and older):**
    * Chewable tablets (311 mg): 2-4 tablets every 4 hours, up to a maximum of 4 doses in 24 hours.
* **Occasional Constipation:**
    * **Ages 2 to under 6 years:** 400-1200 mg/day in single or divided doses. Maximum 1200 mg/day.
    * **Ages 6 to under 12 years:** 1200-2400 mg/day in single or divided doses. Maximum 2400 mg/day.
    * **Ages 12 years and older:** 2400-4800 mg/day in single or divided doses. Maximum 4800 mg/day.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed for liver impairment.  However, individuals with severe kidney failure should avoid magnesium hydroxide due to the risk of magnesium toxicity.  Those with reduced kidney function should have their serum magnesium levels monitored.


### Side Effects

* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dehydration
* Hypermagnesemia (high levels of magnesium in the blood â€“ a serious side effect, especially in those with kidney problems)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially severe or persistent diarrhea or signs of hypermagnesemia (muscle weakness, slowed breathing, confusion), contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Magnesium hydroxide works as an antacid by neutralizing stomach acid. When it comes into contact with stomach acid (hydrochloric acid), it forms magnesium chloride, a less acidic substance. This reduces the acidity in the stomach, providing relief from heartburn and similar symptoms. As a laxative, it works by drawing water into the intestines through osmosis, softening the stool and increasing bowel movements.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Magnesium hydroxide is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to it or any of its ingredients.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution when using magnesium hydroxide in patients with pre-existing electrolyte imbalances, myasthenia gravis (a neuromuscular disorder), or impaired kidney function.
* **Drug Interactions:** Magnesium hydroxide can reduce the absorption of certain medications, such as tetracyclines (antibiotics) and bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis).  Avoid taking these medications concurrently without consulting your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Magnesium hydroxide is categorized as pregnancy category D, meaning there is evidence of risk to the fetus.  It's considered compatible with breastfeeding at usual doses, but the infant should be monitored for any adverse effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take magnesium hydroxide?** A:  For heartburn relief, use as needed for short-term symptom management. For constipation, it's intended for occasional use, not long-term treatment.  Consult your doctor if symptoms persist.

* **Q: Can I take magnesium hydroxide with other medications?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you're taking.

* **Q: How should I store magnesium hydroxide?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I overdose on magnesium hydroxide?** A: Contact your doctor or poison control center immediately.

* **Q: Is magnesium hydroxide safe for everyone?** A:  While generally safe when used as directed, it's crucial to consult your doctor before using magnesium hydroxide if you have any underlying health conditions, especially kidney problems.
