* **Cream/Ointment:** Eczema (atopic dermatitis), psoriasis, other inflammatory skin conditions.
* **Inhaler:** Asthma, preventing and treating asthma symptoms.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the route of administration and the duration of treatment.  Common side effects include:

**How it Works:**

Mometasone furoate is a potent corticosteroid. It works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors within cells, reducing the production of inflammatory substances like leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cytokines. This reduces inflammation and swelling, relieving symptoms associated with allergic and inflammatory conditions.
