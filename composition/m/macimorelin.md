# Macimorelin
### Generic Name
Macimorelin

### Usage
Macimorelin is primarily used for the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency.  It's a growth hormone secretagogue, meaning it stimulates the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. This allows doctors to assess whether a person's pituitary gland is functioning properly and producing sufficient growth hormone.  The drug's use is limited to diagnosing this deficiency; it's not a treatment for growth hormone deficiency itself. Its safety and diagnostic accuracy haven't been established for individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m².

### Dosage
**Diagnostic use (Growth Hormone Deficiency):**

* **Adults (BMI ≤ 40 kg/m²):** The standard dose is 0.5 mg/kg administered as a single oral dose.  The medication comes in powder form; the entire contents of the pouch(es) must be dissolved in 120 mL of water and consumed within 30 seconds.  It's crucial to fast for at least 8 hours before taking Macimorelin.  Other pituitary hormone deficiencies should be corrected before administering this medication.

* **Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Macimorelin in children have not been established.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Sinus bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Feeling hot (flushing)
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Hunger
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat)


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm seen on an electrocardiogram, ECG). This can potentially lead to serious heart problems.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Macimorelin is a growth hormone secretagogue receptor agonist.  This means it mimics the action of ghrelin, a natural hormone that stimulates the release of growth hormone. By binding to growth hormone secretagogue receptors in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, Macimorelin triggers the release of growth hormone into the bloodstream. Measuring the resulting growth hormone levels helps diagnose growth hormone deficiency.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Macimorelin is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to Macimorelin or any of its components.

**Increased Risk:**  There is an increased risk of QT prolongation and false-negative test results in individuals with recent-onset hypothalamic disease.

**Interactions:**

* **QT-prolonging drugs:** Co-administration with drugs that prolong the QT interval (certain antipsychotics, antibiotics, and antiarrhythmic medications) may increase the risk of torsade de pointes (a type of potentially fatal irregular heartbeat).
* **Strong CYP3A4 inducers:**  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers (medications that increase the activity of the liver enzyme CYP3A4) can significantly reduce Macimorelin plasma levels, potentially leading to false-negative test results.


**Use with Caution:**  Macimorelin should be used with caution in patients with endocrine disorders.  It's crucial to correct other pituitary hormone deficiencies before administering Macimorelin.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of Macimorelin during pregnancy has not been established. While the single-dose administration minimizes risk, the decision to breastfeed after administration should consider the potential for infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of the mother's treatment.

### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for Macimorelin to work?**

A:  The effects of Macimorelin are measured by monitoring growth hormone levels in the blood at various time points (typically 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes) after administration.

**Q:  How is Macimorelin stored?**

A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication's packaging.  Generally, medications should be stored at room temperature and away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I take Macimorelin with other medications?**

A: It is essential to inform your doctor of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking before taking Macimorelin, as interactions are possible.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A:  Since Macimorelin is typically administered as a single dose for diagnostic purposes, missing a dose may necessitate rescheduling the test.  Consult your physician for guidance.

**Q: Is Macimorelin a treatment for growth hormone deficiency?**

A: No, Macimorelin is solely a diagnostic tool used to assess growth hormone deficiency; it does not treat the condition.  Separate treatments are available if a deficiency is confirmed.
