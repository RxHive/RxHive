# Mifepristone + Misoprostol
### Generic Name
Mifepristone + Misoprostol


### Usage
Mifepristone and misoprostol, when used together, are primarily indicated for medical termination of pregnancy (also known as medication abortion).  This combination is effective up to a certain gestational age, typically within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy (though the exact timeframe may vary depending on local regulations and clinical guidelines). Mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone crucial for maintaining pregnancy, while misoprostol stimulates uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy tissue.  It's important to note that this medication is only used under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional who will confirm the pregnancy and assess the patient's suitability for this procedure.  This is not a self-treating option.


### Dosage
The dosage of mifepristone and misoprostol for medical abortion varies depending on the specific protocol used by the healthcare provider and the gestational age.  A common regimen involves an oral dose of mifepristone followed by a subsequent oral or vaginal administration of misoprostol, several hours to a few days later.  The exact dosages and timing are determined and carefully explained by the healthcare professional. There is no pediatric use for this combination.  Intravenous administration is not applicable for this medication combination.  Detailed instructions will be provided by your physician concerning the specific dosage and administration method appropriate for your situation.  It is crucial to follow these instructions precisely.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of mifepristone and misoprostol can include:

*   Vaginal bleeding (often heavy and prolonged)
*   Cramping
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Fever
*   Headache
*   Fatigue

Less common, but more serious side effects requiring immediate medical attention include:

*   Severe abdominal pain
*   Heavy or prolonged bleeding (requiring blood transfusion)
*   Signs of infection
*   Incomplete abortion (requiring further medical intervention)
*   Allergic reactions


It is vital to contact your healthcare provider immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works
Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor blocker.  Progesterone is a hormone essential for maintaining a pregnancy by preventing the uterine lining from shedding.  By blocking progesterone's action, mifepristone makes the uterine lining less supportive of the pregnancy.  Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog, which causes the uterus to contract and expel the pregnancy tissue. The combined effect of these two medications leads to the termination of the pregnancy.


### Precautions
Mifepristone and misoprostol are not suitable for everyone.  Contraindications include:

*   Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus)
*   Certain blood clotting disorders
*   Long-term corticosteroid use
*   Severe anemia
*   Known allergy to mifepristone or misoprostol

This medication combination should be used with caution in patients with:

*   Heart conditions
*   High blood pressure
*   Asthma
*   History of ectopic pregnancy

Pregnant individuals should discuss all medications, including herbal supplements, with their healthcare provider before starting medical abortion.   This combination is not suitable during breast feeding.   The use of this medication in elderly populations is not relevant.  It is not intended for use in pediatric patients.
