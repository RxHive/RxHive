# Mifepristone + Misoprostol

**Generic Name:** Mifepristone + Misoprostol (Combination)

**Usage:**  This combination of medications is used to induce a medical abortion.  It's effective in terminating a pregnancy up to a certain gestational age (typically 10 weeks, but this can vary depending on local regulations and the specific regimen).  The exact protocol for administration (dosing and timing of each medication) will be determined by a healthcare provider.  It is *not* intended for use after this gestational age or for any other purpose.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary in intensity and frequency.  Common side effects include:

* **Bleeding:**  This is expected and can range from light spotting to heavy bleeding, similar to a heavy menstrual period.  Cramping is also common.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Vomiting:**  Throwing up.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose stools.
* **Fever:**  A slight elevation in temperature.
* **Headache:** Pain in the head.
* **Chills:** Feeling cold.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired.
* **Abdominal cramping:** Pain in the abdomen.

**Severe side effects, though less common, require immediate medical attention:**

* **Heavy bleeding:**  Soaking more than two thick pads per hour for several hours.
* **Severe abdominal pain:**  Intense pain that doesn't respond to over-the-counter pain relievers.
* **Fever above 100.4°F (38°C):**  High fever that persists.
* **Signs of infection:**  Pus, foul-smelling discharge, or severe abdominal tenderness.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Hives, swelling, difficulty breathing.

**How it Works:**

Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is essential for maintaining a pregnancy.  This causes the lining of the uterus to break down.  Misoprostol then causes contractions of the uterus, resulting in the expulsion of the pregnancy tissue.
