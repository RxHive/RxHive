# Meglumine Diatrizoate
### Generic Name
Meglumine Diatrizoate

### Usage
Meglumine diatrizoate is a contrast medium, specifically a radiopaque agent, primarily used in retrograde cystourethrography.  This procedure involves filling the bladder and urethra with the contrast agent to visualize these structures during an X-ray examination. This allows healthcare professionals to assess for abnormalities like strictures (narrowing), obstructions, or other structural issues within the urinary tract.  While its primary use is in retrograde cystourethrography, it is important to note that this medication is *not* for intravenous use.


### Dosage

**Retrograde Cystourethrography (Bladder Instillation):**

* **Adults:** 25-300 mL.  The exact dose depends on the individual's age and bladder capacity.  Larger volumes (over 300 mL) might be used if tolerated by the patient, ensuring the bladder is adequately filled for optimal imaging.
* **Children:** The dosage is the same as for adults, tailored to the child's bladder capacity.

**Important Considerations:** A low-residue diet the day before the procedure and a laxative the night before are often recommended.  A scout film (preliminary X-ray) is typically taken before the contrast agent is administered.  The medication is intended for bladder instillation only and should not be administered intravenously.  The preparation may require dilution according to the manufacturer's instructions, sometimes it is ready to use.

### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Information on the frequency of side effects is not consistently defined in available sources.
* **Less Common, but Serious:** Anaphylactoid reactions (severe allergic-type reactions), hypersensitivity reactions (including facial edema, glottis edema, respiratory distress, convulsions, and shock), altered thyroid hormone levels, and hypothyroidism.


**Important Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it's crucial to seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Meglumine diatrizoate is radiopaque, meaning it absorbs X-rays. When instilled into the bladder and urethra, it allows these structures to be clearly visualized on X-ray images, highlighting their anatomy and revealing any potential abnormalities.  It works by providing a contrast between the tissues and the injected solution, thereby improving the visibility of the urinary tract during the imaging process.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Meglumine diatrizoate is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to diatrizoate meglumine, salts of diatrizoic acid, or any component of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:** Patients with myasthenia gravis or active urinary tract infections should use meglumine diatrizoate with caution.  There is an increased risk of severe sensitivity reactions and hypothyroidism.
* **Pregnancy:** Meglumine diatrizoate is classified as Category C in pregnancy.  Use during pregnancy should be avoided unless deemed absolutely necessary to obtain critical diagnostic information.
* **Breastfeeding:** Although excreted in breast milk, the low expected levels and low absorption from the infant's gastrointestinal tract generally allow breastfeeding to continue after administration.  However, always consult a healthcare professional.
