# Methocarbamol
### Generic Name
Methocarbamol

### Usage

Methocarbamol is a muscle relaxant primarily used to relieve muscle spasms associated with painful musculoskeletal conditions.  These conditions can include acute back pain, neck pain, and other injuries causing muscle strain or spasm. It's considered an *adjunctive* therapy, meaning it works best when combined with other treatments like physical therapy, rest, and pain relievers (such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen).  A less common but significant use is as adjunctive therapy in managing the neuromuscular symptoms of tetanus.  It's important to note that methocarbamol does not address the underlying cause of the muscle spasm; it only helps manage the symptom.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous), the severity of the condition, and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow a healthcare provider's specific instructions.  The following information is for general understanding only and should not be considered medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Muscle Spasm (Oral):** Typically starts with 1.5 grams three to four times daily for two to three days.  The maximum daily dose can reach 8 grams in severe cases, but this is generally only for a short period.  The dose is then usually reduced to 750 mg to 1.5 g three to four times daily after the initial few days.

* **Muscle Spasm (Intramuscular or Intravenous):**  The initial dose is usually 1 gram, repeated every eight hours as needed.  The maximum daily dose is 3 grams, and intravenous administration should not exceed three consecutive days.

* **Tetanus (Adjunctive Therapy, Intravenous):** The initial dose is 1-3 grams injected directly into an IV line.  This dose may be repeated every 6 hours depending on the patient's response and transition to oral administration once possible.  High oral doses (up to 24 grams daily) may be necessary.

**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for children and adolescents is determined by weight and/or body surface area and is generally prescribed only by a physician specializing in pediatrics.  Intravenous use in tetanus is less common now, often being replaced by other medications.  Always consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing.  Adolescents aged 16 and older may receive adult dosages for muscle spasms.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Weakness
* Blurred vision


Less common but serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Seizures
* Low blood pressure
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

The precise mechanism of methocarbamol's action isn't fully understood. It's believed to work primarily by depressing the central nervous system (CNS), reducing the transmission of pain signals and muscle spasm signals to the brain.  It doesn't directly relax muscles; instead, it indirectly affects the brain's perception and response to muscle spasms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methocarbamol is contraindicated in individuals with known allergies to the drug or its components, and for the intravenous formulation, renal impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Methocarbamol can interact with other central nervous system depressants (alcohol, opioids, sedatives, etc.), potentially increasing drowsiness and other side effects.  It may also interact with certain other medications; consult your doctor about potential interactions with any other medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Methocarbamol is a Category C pregnancy drug, meaning its safety during pregnancy isn't established. It should be used only when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. The drug's excretion in breast milk is unknown, and caution is advised if breastfeeding.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults are at increased risk of falls and other adverse events due to drowsiness and dizziness.  Methocarbamol should be used with extra caution in this population.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Because of the potential for drowsiness, avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how methocarbamol affects you.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for methocarbamol to work?**  A:  The onset of effect can vary but generally occurs within 30-60 minutes after oral administration.  Intravenous administration provides faster relief.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking methocarbamol?** A: No. Alcohol can significantly increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.

* **Q: How should I store methocarbamol?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I stop taking methocarbamol suddenly?** A:  It's generally best to follow your doctor's instructions regarding tapering off the medication to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
