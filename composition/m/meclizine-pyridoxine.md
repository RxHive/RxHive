# Meclizine + Pyridoxine
### Generic Name
Meclizine + Pyridoxine

### Usage

Meclizine and Pyridoxine is a combination medication used to treat various conditions involving nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.  Its primary use is in preventing and managing motion sickness.  It's also used to prevent and control nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy, surgery, and radiation therapy.  Additionally, it helps manage vertigo (dizziness) related to inner ear problems affecting the vestibular system.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  The standard tablet contains 25 mg of Meclizine hydrochloride and 50 mg of Pyridoxine hydrochloride.  Dosage varies depending on the condition:

* **Motion sickness:** 1-2 tablets one hour before travel; repeat every 24 hours as needed.
* **Nausea and vomiting (pregnancy):**  Start with 1-2 tablets daily; increase to a maximum of 4 tablets daily in divided doses if necessary.
* **Postoperative nausea and vomiting:** 1-2 tablets daily, increasing to 4 tablets daily in divided doses if needed, or 2 tablets four hours before surgery.
* **Radiation-associated nausea and vomiting:** 1-2 tablets daily; increase to 4 tablets daily in divided doses if necessary.
* **Vertigo:** 1-4 tablets daily as needed, in divided doses.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Ages 1-12 years:** 1 mg/kg of Meclizine daily (the dosage is based on Meclizine content).  The maximum daily dose is 100 mg of Meclizine and 200 mg of Pyridoxine.
* **Ages >12 years:** Same as adult dosage.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; use with caution in these cases.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Constipation
* Upset stomach
* Dry mouth
* Agitation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Insomnia
* Blurred vision
* Dry nose and throat

Less common, but serious side effects include agranulocytosis (low white blood cell count) and leukemia (although these are rare).  If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Meclizine is an antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors.  This action helps suppress the signals from the inner ear that cause dizziness and nausea.  It also affects the central nervous system, reducing the feeling of nausea and vomiting. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) plays a role in various metabolic processes in the body, and its contribution to this combination's effectiveness isn't fully understood but may support the overall anti-nausea effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to Meclizine, Pyridoxine, or any formulation component and in children under 1 year of age.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of central nervous system depression.
* **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients with Parkinson's disease, peptic ulcers, asthma, narrow-angle glaucoma, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, prostatic hyperplasia and bladder neck obstruction, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, and myasthenia gravis.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The medication's category during pregnancy is unknown, although it is approved for treating nausea and vomiting in pregnant women.  The excretion of Meclizine in breast milk is unknown, and caution is advised. Pyridoxine is excreted in breast milk, warranting caution during breastfeeding.
