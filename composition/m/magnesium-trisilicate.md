# Magnesium Trisilicate
### Generic Name
Magnesium Trisilicate

### Usage
Magnesium trisilicate is primarily used as an antacid to relieve symptoms associated with indigestion, heartburn, and dyspepsia.  These symptoms often stem from excess stomach acid.  It's a relatively common and widely available treatment for these common digestive complaints.  While not a treatment for the underlying causes of these conditions, it effectively neutralizes stomach acid, providing symptomatic relief.


### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (typically a liquid mixture) and the age of the patient.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

* **Adults (Indigestion, heartburn, or dyspepsia):** The typical oral dose is 10-20 mL of magnesium trisilicate mixture three times a day (TID) or as needed to alleviate symptoms.
* **Children (5-12 years, Indigestion, heartburn, or dyspepsia):**  A lower dose of 5-10 mL of magnesium trisilicate mixture three times a day (TID) or as needed is generally recommended.  Always consult a pediatrician before giving this medication to a child.


**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired liver or kidney function. Magnesium trisilicate is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with severe renal failure or liver cirrhosis.  Always seek professional advice before adjusting dosage.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Mild diarrhea
* Stomach cramps
* Belching

Less common, but potentially more serious side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Magnesium trisilicate works by neutralizing stomach acid.  It acts as a buffer, reacting with the hydrochloric acid in the stomach to reduce its acidity.  This neutralization process helps alleviate the burning sensation associated with heartburn and indigestion. The medication also has a mild laxative effect.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Magnesium trisilicate should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components, severe renal failure, hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels in the blood),  or those who need to strictly control their sodium intake (e.g., patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or liver cirrhosis).  It's also contraindicated in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis, hypocalcemia, or hypochlorhydria.

* **Cautions:** Use with caution in patients with fluid retention, renal impairment, those taking corticosteroids, and patients with respiratory acidosis, eclampsia, or aldosteronism.

* **Drug Interactions:** Magnesium trisilicate can interact with other medications, potentially affecting their absorption and effectiveness.  It may reduce the effectiveness of drugs like raltegravir, atazanavir, pazopanib, and ponatinib.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  It's generally recommended to avoid taking other medications within 2-4 hours of taking magnesium trisilicate (allow an interval of at least 4 hours before or 2 hours after erlotinib).

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of magnesium trisilicate during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
