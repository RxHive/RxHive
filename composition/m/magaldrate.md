# Magaldrate

**Generic Name:** Magaldrate

**Usage:** Magaldrate is an antacid used to relieve heartburn, sour stomach, and acid indigestion. It's often used for short-term relief of these symptoms.  It may also be used to treat symptoms associated with excessive stomach acid, such as upset stomach and nausea.  It is typically not used for long-term treatment.

**Side Effects:**  Generally, magaldrate is considered well-tolerated. However, side effects can occur, although they are usually mild. These may include:

* **Constipation:** This is a relatively common side effect.
* **Diarrhea:** Less common than constipation.
* **Electrolyte imbalances (rare but serious):**  Prolonged or excessive use can lead to imbalances in calcium, phosphate, or magnesium levels, particularly in individuals with kidney problems. This is why it's not recommended for long-term use.
* **Aluminum toxicity (rare but serious):**  Can occur with prolonged high-dose use, particularly in individuals with kidney impairment.  Symptoms can include bone pain, confusion, and weakness.
* **Drug interactions:** Magaldrate can interact with certain medications, reducing their absorption.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking.

**How it Works:** Magaldrate is a combination of aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.  Both are antacids that neutralize stomach acid by reacting with it to form water and salts. Aluminum hydroxide acts as a slower-acting antacid while magnesium hydroxide has a faster onset of action. The combination provides both rapid and sustained relief.
