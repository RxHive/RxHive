# Magaldrate
### Generic Name
Magaldrate

### Usage
Magaldrate is an antacid used to relieve the symptoms of heartburn, sour stomach, and acid indigestion.  It works by neutralizing excess stomach acid. While its primary use is for short-term relief of these symptoms, it's not intended for long-term use or the treatment of underlying medical conditions.  If symptoms persist or worsen, consulting a doctor is crucial.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the formulation (suspension, tablets, etc.), which isn't specified in the provided information.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and the product packaging.  The information given below is from the provided data and might not represent all formulations.

**Adult Dosage (as per provided data,  formulation unspecified):**

* For heartburn, sour stomach, and acid indigestion:  The typical dose is 5-10 mL (1-2 teaspoonfuls) of a suspension (540 mg/5 mL) between meals and at bedtime. The maximum daily dose is 80 mL (16 teaspoonfuls).  Specific instructions will vary by product and should be followed exactly.


**Pediatric Dosage:** Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.  Do not administer to children without explicit direction from a pediatrician.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The provided data states that no dosage adjustments are specified for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, caution is advised for individuals with kidney problems as aluminum and/or magnesium can accumulate, potentially causing adverse effects.  Always consult a doctor before using magaldrate if you have kidney or liver issues.


### Side Effects
Common side effects include:

* Chalky taste
* Constipation
* Fecal impaction
* Stomach cramps

Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Aluminum intoxication
* Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels)
* Osteomalacia (softening of the bones)
* Diarrhea
* Hypermagnesemia (high magnesium levels)

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, stop taking magaldrate and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
Magaldrate neutralizes stomach acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid (HCl) present in the stomach. This reaction increases the pH of the stomach contents, relieving the symptoms of excess acidity.  It also has a mild antiflatulent effect, helping to reduce gas.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Magaldrate should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to magaldrate or any of its components.

* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate levels), particularly in patients with kidney problems.

* **Use with Caution:**  Magaldrate should be used cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women, patients with renal failure, those on a magnesium-restricted diet, older adults, and individuals taking other medications.  Magaldrate can potentially interact with other drugs, affecting their absorption or efficacy.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

* **Renal Impairment:** Individuals with kidney problems should exercise extreme caution and only use magaldrate under strict medical supervision due to the risk of magnesium and aluminum accumulation.
