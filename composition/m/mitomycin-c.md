# Mitomycin C
### Generic Name
Mitomycin C

### Usage

Mitomycin C is an antineoplastic antibiotic used in cancer treatment.  Its primary use is in combination with other chemotherapy agents for disseminated adenocarcinoma of the stomach and pancreas. It's also employed palliatively when other treatments have failed.  

Beyond systemic use, Mitomycin C has other applications:

* **Pyelocalyceal instillation:** This method targets low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer.  The medication is instilled directly into the renal pelvis and calyces.
* **Ophthalmic use:**  Mitomycin C is used topically as an adjunct to glaucoma filtration surgery, helping to reduce scarring and improve the success of the procedure.


### Dosage

Mitomycin C dosage varies greatly depending on the specific cancer being treated, the route of administration (intravenous, intravesical, intra-arterial, pyelocalyceal instillation, or ophthalmic), and the patient's overall health.  It's crucial to note that different formulations (systemic injection, ureteral gel, ophthalmic) are not interchangeable.  The following are examples and **should not be interpreted as a prescription**.  Dosage must be determined and monitored by a qualified oncologist or ophthalmologist:

**Systemic (IV):** Doses range widely from 6 mg/m² to 20 mg/m², administered at intervals of several weeks, often in combination with other chemotherapy drugs. Specific regimens depend on the type and stage of cancer.

**Pyelocalyceal Instillation (Ureteral Gel):**  The typical regimen involves weekly instillations of Mitomycin C (as a ureteral gel) for six weeks, followed by monthly instillations for up to 11 additional doses if there's a complete response. The total dose and volume are carefully determined based on pyelography.  Sodium bicarbonate premedication is usually required.

**Ophthalmic:**  In glaucoma surgery, a 0.2 mg dose, applied to the surgical site via saturated sponges for 2 minutes, is common.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Mitomycin C in children have not been established.

Dosage adjustments are frequently needed based on factors such as renal and hepatic function, bone marrow suppression, and patient weight.  Consult the prescribing information for detailed guidelines on dose modification in various situations.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Systemic):**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Anorexia
* Myelosuppression (low blood cell counts)
* Fever


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects (Systemic):**

* Pulmonary toxicity (lung damage)
* Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) – a life-threatening condition affecting the kidneys and blood
* Cardiac toxicity
* Renal failure
* Bladder fibrosis/contraction


**Side Effects (Pyelocalyceal Instillation):**

* Ureteral obstruction
* Renal insufficiency
* Urinary tract infections
* Bone marrow suppression


**Side Effects (Ophthalmic):**

* Cataract formation
* Corneal or scleral damage
* Hypotony (low eye pressure)
* Infection at the surgical site


**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any concerning side effects.


### How it Works

Mitomycin C is an alkylating agent that works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, interfering with their ability to replicate and grow. It achieves this through DNA cross-linking, primarily affecting guanine and cytosine base pairs.  The drug isn't cell-cycle specific but is most effective against cells in the late G and early S phases of the cell cycle. In ophthalmic use, it alters vascular endothelium and inhibits fibroblast proliferation, reducing scarring.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Mitomycin C is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.
* **Bone Marrow Suppression:** This is a major risk with systemic administration.  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor blood cell counts.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired kidney or liver function.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Mitomycin C is categorized as Pregnancy Category X and is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Mitomycin C can interact with various other medications. Consult a healthcare professional about any other medications you are taking.
* **Extravasation:** If intravenous administration leaks outside the vein (extravasation), immediate action is needed to minimize tissue damage.
* **Bleeding Risk:** Patients with bleeding disorders should be carefully monitored.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Mitomycin C stored?** A:  Storage instructions vary depending on the formulation.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product label.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Mitomycin C?** A:  It’s best to discuss alcohol consumption with your doctor. Alcohol can have unpredictable interactions with chemotherapy drugs and could exacerbate side effects.
* **Q: How long does it take for Mitomycin C to work?** A: The response to Mitomycin C varies greatly depending on several factors.  It's not a quick-acting drug, and its effects are usually seen over time.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Never adjust your dose or schedule without consulting your healthcare provider.
* **Q: Is Mitomycin C safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use significantly increases the risks of severe side effects.  Treatment duration is carefully determined by your oncologist based on individual needs and response to treatment.
