# Mirabegron + Silodosin
### Generic Name

Mirabegron + Silodosin (Combination Therapy)


**Note:**  Mirabegron and Silodosin are not typically combined into a single pill.  This information describes the combined use of these two medications, often prescribed together to manage specific urinary conditions.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions regarding dosage and administration.

### Usage

This combination therapy is primarily used to treat symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) in men, particularly those with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  

* **Mirabegron:** This medication is a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist. It relaxes the bladder muscle, reducing the urge to urinate frequently and unexpectedly.
* **Silodosin:** This is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker. It relaxes the muscles in the prostate and the neck of the bladder, improving urine flow and reducing urinary obstruction common in BPH.

By combining these two medications, the treatment aims to address both the overactive bladder symptoms (urgency, frequency, urge incontinence) and the urinary obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate.  This combined approach often provides more comprehensive symptom relief than using either drug alone.

### Dosage

Dosage is entirely determined by the prescribing physician and depends on individual needs and response to therapy. There is no standard combination pill; dosages for Mirabegron and Silodosin are given separately.

* **Mirabegron:**  The usual starting dose for adults is 50 mg once daily.  The dose may be increased to 100 mg once daily if needed and tolerated.  Mirabegron is available in oral tablet form.  It is not recommended for IV administration.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with impaired kidney function.  There is limited data on use in children.

* **Silodosin:** The usual dose for adults is 8 mg once daily, taken orally. Dosage adjustments are needed for patients with severely impaired kidney or liver function. It's available as oral capsules. It should not be given intravenously.  Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.


**Important:** Always consult your doctor before starting, stopping, or altering the dosage of any medication.

### How it Works

* **Mirabegron:** Relaxes the detrusor muscle (the muscle in the bladder wall) making it less likely to contract involuntarily, thus decreasing urgency and frequency of urination.

* **Silodosin:** Relaxes the muscles in the prostate gland and the bladder neck, thereby improving urine flow and relieving obstruction.  This helps to address the blockage often contributing to urinary symptoms in men with BPH.
