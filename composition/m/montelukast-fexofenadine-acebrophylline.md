# Montelukast + Fexofenadine + Acebrophylline
### Generic Name
Montelukast + Fexofenadine + Acebrophylline


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used to treat the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma.  It combines three active ingredients that work in different ways to provide comprehensive relief:

* **Montelukast:** This is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Leukotrienes are substances in the body that contribute to inflammation and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways), which are key features of asthma and allergic reactions.  Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, reducing inflammation and improving breathing.

* **Fexofenadine:** This is an antihistamine. Histamine is a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itching, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine blocks the action of histamine, alleviating these allergic symptoms.

* **Acebrophylline:** This is a bronchodilator. It relaxes the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe.  It's particularly helpful in managing the bronchoconstriction associated with asthma.

The combined effect of these three ingredients provides broader symptom relief compared to using each medication individually. This combination is particularly useful in managing moderate to severe allergic rhinitis and asthma symptoms, helping to control both inflammation and bronchospasm.



### Dosage

Dosage instructions vary greatly depending on the specific formulation (tablet, syrup, etc.), the age and weight of the patient, and the severity of their condition.  **It's crucial to follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There is no standard "one-size-fits-all" dosage for this combination medication.  Self-adjusting the dosage is highly discouraged.

**Always consult with a healthcare professional for the correct dosage based on your individual needs.**  They will consider your medical history and current condition to determine the appropriate dose and administration method. Oral and IV formulations are not common for this particular combination; the usual route of administration is oral (tablet or syrup).



### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Sleep disturbances (insomnia or drowsiness)
* Dry mouth

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) – characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and hives.
* Irregular heartbeat
* Liver problems
* Mood changes, including anxiety or depression
* Seizures


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as more serious, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.



### How it Works

As explained above, this combination medication works by targeting several pathways involved in allergic reactions and asthma:

1. **Montelukast:** Blocks leukotrienes, reducing inflammation in the airways and nasal passages.
2. **Fexofenadine:** Blocks histamine, reducing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
3. **Acebrophylline:** Relaxes the muscles in the airways, improving airflow and breathing.


By acting on different aspects of the inflammatory and allergic response, this combined therapy aims to provide comprehensive relief from symptoms.
