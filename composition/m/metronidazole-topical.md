# Metronidazole (Topical)
### Generic Name
Metronidazole (Topical)

### Usage
Metronidazole topical is primarily used to treat the inflammatory lesions and erythema (redness) associated with rosacea.  It's also used off-label in some cases of periorificial dermatitis (inflammation around the mouth, nose, eyes, etc.).  It's crucial to remember that this medication is for external use only and should not be ingested.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation and the condition being treated. Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally:

* **Rosacea:** For 0.75% formulations, a thin film is typically applied twice daily (BID) to the affected area after washing. For 1% formulations, application once daily (OD) is common.  Always follow the directions on your specific product's label.

* **Periorificial Dermatitis (Off-label):**  For infants 6 months and older, children, and adolescents, a 0.75% gel may be applied once or twice daily in a thin layer.  Again, strictly follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (affecting 1-10% or more of users) can include:

* Headache
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Nausea
* Erythema (redness)
* Contact dermatitis
* Burning sensation
* Itching (pruritus)
* Skin irritation
* Stinging
* Dry skin (xeroderma)
* Urinary tract infection
* Local hypersensitivity reactions

Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects include:

* Lacrimation (watering eyes)
* Acne vulgaris (worsening of acne)
* Conjunctivitis (eye inflammation)
* Eye irritation
* Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage)
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)

If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, discontinue use and consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Metronidazole is an antibiotic that works by entering the bacteria or other microorganisms and interfering with their DNA. This disruption causes damage to the organism's genetic material, inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately leading to the death of the susceptible organisms, thereby reducing inflammation and redness.  Specifically, it targets bacteria like *Cutibacterium acnes* which are often involved in rosacea.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Metronidazole topical is contraindicated for individuals with a known hypersensitivity to metronidazole, parabens, other ingredients in the formulation, or other nitroimidazole derivatives.
* **Liver Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with severe liver disease.
* **Blood Disorders:** Use with caution in patients with a history of blood dyscrasias (disorders of blood cells).
* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Diseases:** Use with caution in individuals with CNS disorders.
* **Carcinogenicity:** Although the risk with topical application is low, unnecessary use should be avoided.
* **Superinfections:** There's a risk of fungal or bacterial superinfections; if this occurs, treatment may need to be adjusted.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Metronidazole is categorized as a Pregnancy Category B drug, meaning studies in animals have not shown a risk, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  It's excreted in breast milk but is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding after topical application.  Always consult your doctor about the risks and benefits.
* **Interactions:** Metronidazole topical may interact with alcohol, disulfiram, lopinavir, and tipranavir.  Discuss any other medications you're taking with your doctor or pharmacist.
* **Eye Contact:** Avoid contact with the eyes.
