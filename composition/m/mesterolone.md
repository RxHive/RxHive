# Mesterolone
### Generic Name
Mesterolone

### Usage
Mesterolone is a synthetic androgen, meaning it mimics the effects of the male hormone testosterone.  Its primary use is as androgen replacement therapy in adult males with hypogonadism â€“ a condition characterized by the body's failure to produce enough testosterone. This deficiency can lead to a variety of symptoms, including reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle mass, fatigue, and mood changes. Mesterolone helps to alleviate these symptoms by providing the body with the necessary androgens.  It's also used to treat male infertility associated with hypogonadism, as testosterone plays a crucial role in sperm production.

### Dosage

**Adults:**  For androgen deficiency and associated male infertility, the usual starting oral dose is 75-100 mg per day, divided into 3-4 doses. The maintenance dose is typically 50-75 mg per day, also divided.

**Children:**  The safety and effectiveness of mesterolone in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have liver or kidney problems.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Abdominal discomfort or pain
* Fluid retention and edema (swelling)
* Frequent or persistent erections
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)


Less common, but serious side effects, may include:

* Priapism (a prolonged, painful erection)
* Malignant or non-malignant liver tumors
* Skeletal metastasis (cancer spread to the bones)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Mesterolone works by binding to androgen receptors in various tissues and organs throughout the body. This binding triggers a series of cellular events that promote the growth and development of male sex characteristics.  Unlike some other androgens, mesterolone doesn't significantly suppress the body's natural production of testosterone or sperm production. This makes it a relatively gentler option for androgen replacement therapy compared to some alternatives.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Mesterolone is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to mesterolone or any of its components
* Prostate cancer
* Breast cancer
* History of or active hepatic (liver) tumors


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of fluid retention and edema, particularly in individuals with diabetes, epilepsy, or migraine.
* Increased risk of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels).
* Increased risk of hepatic tumors.
* Increased risk of dyslipidemia (abnormal blood fat levels).
* Increased risk of priapism or excessive sexual stimulation.
* Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (blood clots).


Mesterolone should be used cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disorders, edematous conditions, or polycythemia (increased red blood cell count).  It is not indicated for use in females and should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Use in puberty may lead to premature closure of the epiphyses, stopping linear growth.  Androgen abuse can have severe cardiovascular and metabolic consequences.
