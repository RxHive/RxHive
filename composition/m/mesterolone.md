# Mesterolone

**Generic Name:** Mesterolone

**Usage:**

Mesterolone is an anabolic-androgenic steroid primarily used for the treatment of hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) in adult men.  It's also sometimes used off-label to treat certain types of anemia and to improve muscle mass and strength in men with conditions that cause muscle wasting.  However, its use in these latter indications is less common and often controversial due to side effects and the availability of other, potentially safer alternatives.  It's important to note that the use of mesterolone must always be under the strict supervision of a physician.

**Side Effects:**

Mesterolone, like other anabolic steroids, can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity depending on the dosage and individual response. These side effects can include:

* **Androgenic side effects:** Acne, oily skin, increased hair growth (hirsutism), male pattern baldness, enlarged prostate, and aggression.
* **Hepatic (liver) effects:**  Although generally considered less hepatotoxic than some other anabolic steroids, elevated liver enzyme levels can occur.
* **Cardiovascular effects:**  Increased risk of high blood pressure and cholesterol changes (increased LDL, decreased HDL).
* **Endocrine effects:**  Gynecomastia (breast enlargement) is relatively uncommon,  but possible, especially at higher doses. Suppression of endogenous testosterone production can occur, leading to further hormonal imbalances.
* **Other side effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sleep disturbances, and changes in libido are also reported.


**How it Works:**

Mesterolone is a synthetic steroid that binds to androgen receptors in various tissues throughout the body. This binding triggers anabolic (muscle-building) and androgenic (masculinizing) effects.  Specifically, it promotes protein synthesis, leading to increased muscle mass and strength.  It also stimulates red blood cell production, which can contribute to improved oxygen delivery to tissues.  Importantly, mesterolone has a relatively low androgenic to anabolic ratio compared to other anabolic steroids, meaning it has a lower tendency to cause masculinizing effects.  However, this is relative, and androgenic effects still occur.

**FAQs:**

* **Is Mesterolone a controlled substance?**  In many countries, including the US, Mesterolone is a controlled substance due to its potential for abuse.  It requires a prescription for legal acquisition.
* **Can women use Mesterolone?**  Mesterolone is generally not prescribed for women due to its potential for virilization (development of masculine characteristics) including hirsutism, clitoral enlargement and deepening of the voice.
* **What are the long-term effects of Mesterolone use?**  Long-term use can lead to the exacerbation and continuation of the side effects listed above.  Suppressed testosterone production can become a persistent issue. Liver damage is a potential long-term concern, though less pronounced than with some other anabolic steroids.
* **Can Mesterolone be used for bodybuilding?**  While some individuals may misuse it for this purpose, its use for bodybuilding is not medically recommended due to the risk of serious side effects and the availability of safer alternatives.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Immediately contact your doctor.  Do not stop taking the medication abruptly without consulting your physician.
