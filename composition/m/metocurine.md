# Metocurine
### Generic Name
Metocurine Iodide

### Usage
Metocurine iodide is a neuromuscular blocking agent.  Its primary use was as an adjunct to anesthesia, facilitating skeletal muscle relaxation during surgical procedures. It was also used to reduce the intensity of muscle contractions during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  It's important to note that metocurine iodide is no longer available in the US market and has been discontinued.  Therefore, this information is for historical and educational purposes only.  Do not attempt to obtain or use this medication.

### Dosage
Because metocurine iodide is no longer available, specific dosage information is for historical reference only and should not be used to guide any medical treatment. Dosage varied depending on the patient's weight, age, and the specific surgical or therapeutic procedure.  It was typically administered intravenously.  Precise dosing regimens were determined by the anesthesiologist or physician based on the individual patient's needs and response.

### Side Effects
The following side effects were associated with metocurine iodide use.  This list is not exhaustive, and the severity of side effects could vary greatly among individuals.

* **Common:**  Hypotension (low blood pressure), flushing, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and dry mouth.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Respiratory depression (decreased breathing rate and depth), bronchospasm (constriction of the airways), and allergic reactions.  Respiratory depression is of particular concern and requires immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Metocurine iodide is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. This means it works by competitively blocking the action of acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction.  Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter essential for muscle contraction. By blocking ACh's action, metocurine iodide prevents muscle fibers from receiving the signal to contract, resulting in muscle relaxation.


### Precautions
Metocurine iodide should only have been administered under strict medical supervision by trained professionals. Given its discontinuation, these precautions are purely for historical and educational purposes.


* **Contraindications:**  Pre-existing respiratory or cardiac conditions would have significantly increased the risk of serious complications.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Metocurine iodide's effects could be potentiated (increased) or antagonized (decreased) by other medications, particularly other neuromuscular blocking agents, anesthetics, or certain antibiotics.
* **Special Populations:**  Patients with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease, myasthenia gravis, or other neuromuscular disorders were at significantly increased risk of complications.  Use in pregnant or breastfeeding women would have required careful consideration of potential risks to the fetus or infant.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is metocurine iodide still available?**  A: No, metocurine iodide is no longer available in the US market and has been discontinued.

* **Q: What should I do if I have leftover metocurine iodide?** A: Since this medication is no longer available, any remaining product should be safely disposed of according to your local regulations and guidelines. Contact your local waste disposal authority for assistance.

* **Q:  Are there safer alternatives to metocurine iodide?** A:  Yes.  Many newer and safer neuromuscular blocking agents are currently available and are used in modern anesthetic and therapeutic practices.
