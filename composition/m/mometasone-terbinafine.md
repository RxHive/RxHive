# Mometasone + Terbinafine
### Generic Name
Mometasone + Terbinafine


### Usage

Mometasone furoate and terbinafine combination is not a standard, commercially available fixed-dose combination.  Mometasone furoate is a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation, and terbinafine is an antifungal medication. They are often used *separately* to treat conditions involving both inflammation and fungal infection.  While a combined cream might be compounded by a pharmacist in specific cases, it's crucial to understand that this isn't a readily available pre-made medicine.

The individual components are used to treat:

* **Mometasone furoate:** This corticosteroid treats inflammatory skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and allergic reactions manifested as skin inflammation.  It reduces swelling, redness, and itching. It may also be used for other inflammatory conditions as directed by a physician.

* **Terbinafine:** This antifungal medication treats fungal skin infections (tinea), including athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm (tinea corporis), and other cutaneous mycoses.  It works by inhibiting the growth of fungi.

A combined preparation would likely be considered for conditions where both inflammation and a fungal infection are present simultaneously,  requiring the simultaneous treatment of both issues. A dermatologist would determine the need and suitability of such a combination.


### Dosage

There is no standard dosage for a combined mometasone furoate and terbinafine preparation because it is not a commercially available fixed-dose combination. Dosage instructions depend entirely on the individual medications prescribed by a doctor, and will vary based on the specific condition, its severity, and the patient's age and health.  You will receive specific directions from your physician or pharmacist.  For individual components:

* **Mometasone furoate:** Dosage will depend on the formulation (cream, ointment, spray) and the area being treated. It's typically applied thinly to the affected area once or twice daily as directed.

* **Terbinafine:** Dosage varies depending on the formulation (cream, powder, spray, tablets). Creams are usually applied once or twice daily. Oral terbinafine, used for more severe or systemic fungal infections, requires specific dosage instructions from a healthcare professional.

**Children and IV Administration:**  Mometasone furoate is generally not recommended for use in children under two years of age, except under the strict supervision of a physician.  Terbinafine oral dosage for children is carefully calculated based on weight.  IV administration is not typical for either drug in this context; they are typically applied topically or taken orally.



### Side Effects

**Mometasone furoate:**

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* Skin thinning or discoloration.
* Stretch marks (striae).
* Increased risk of infection.
* Acne.
* Allergic contact dermatitis.
* Rarely, more severe systemic effects if absorbed in large quantities.

**Terbinafine:**

* Skin irritation, redness, or burning at the application site.
* Headache.
* Nausea.
* Diarrhea.
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* Rarely, more serious liver problems.


**Combined Use (Hypothetical):**  The combination could potentially increase the risk of any of the above side effects.  If any adverse reaction occurs, stop use and consult a doctor immediately.



### How it Works

* **Mometasone furoate:**  It's a topical corticosteroid that works by binding to intracellular receptors, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like cytokines and prostaglandins, thus reducing inflammation and itching.

* **Terbinafine:** It's an allylamine antifungal agent that inhibits squalene epoxidase, an enzyme crucial for fungal cell membrane synthesis.  This disrupts fungal cell membrane integrity, leading to fungal cell death.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using either medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Children:** Use should be guided by a healthcare professional, especially for mometasone furoate.
* **Liver Disease:**  Terbinafine should be used with caution in patients with liver disease.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Stop use and seek immediate medical attention if a serious allergic reaction occurs.
* **Long-Term Use:**  Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids (mometasone) can lead to skin thinning and increased susceptibility to infection.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this combination without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Mometasone furoate and terbinafine are prescription medications. A doctor must diagnose your condition and prescribe the appropriate medication.  A compounded cream requires a doctor's order.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist. Topical creams should generally be stored at room temperature, away from direct heat and sunlight.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A:  Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Never double the dose.

* **Q:  Can I use this on my face?** A:  Use only as directed by your doctor. Some formulations are not suitable for facial use.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop using the medication and consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
