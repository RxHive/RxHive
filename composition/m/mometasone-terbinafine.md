# Mometasone + Terbinafine

**Generic Name:** Mometasone furoate + Terbinafine hydrochloride

**Usage:** This combination is not a standard, commercially available formulation.  Mometasone furoate and terbinafine hydrochloride are used separately to treat different conditions.  Mometasone furoate is a corticosteroid used topically to treat inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Terbinafine hydrochloride is an antifungal used topically or orally to treat fungal infections like athlete's foot and ringworm.  A combination would theoretically be useful for conditions involving both inflammation and fungal infection, but such a fixed-dose combination product is not currently marketed.  A doctor might prescribe them separately, or in very rare instances, together.

**Side Effects:**  The side effects would depend on which component is used, and how:

* **Mometasone furoate (topical):** Burning, itching, dryness, skin thinning, skin discoloration, acne, striae (stretch marks),  increased hair growth (hypertrichosis),  worsening of existing skin infections.  Long-term or high-potency use can have systemic effects.

* **Terbinafine hydrochloride (topical):** Burning, stinging, itching, rash.  (Oral terbinafine has a wider range of potential side effects including liver problems, taste disturbances, and gastrointestinal upset).

If used together, the side effects of both drugs could potentially occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Mometasone furoate:** This corticosteroid works by reducing inflammation. It suppresses the activity of the immune system in the skin, thereby lessening swelling, redness, and itching.

* **Terbinafine hydrochloride:** This antifungal works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to cell death and inhibits fungal growth.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is there a cream or ointment with both mometasone and terbinafine?** A: No, there is no commercially available fixed-dose combination product containing both mometasone furoate and terbinafine hydrochloride.

* **Q: Can I use mometasone and terbinafine together if my doctor doesn't prescribe them?** A: No.  Mixing medications on your own can be dangerous.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before combining medications.

* **Q: When would a doctor consider prescribing both mometasone and terbinafine?** A:  This would be a rare circumstance where a patient has a skin condition showing both signs of inflammation (requiring a corticosteroid) and a fungal infection (requiring an antifungal).  The doctor would carefully weigh the benefits and risks of combining these treatments. The doctor may prescribe separate creams to use at different times, or apply them in different areas, to avoid interactions.

* **Q: What are the potential drug interactions if used together?** A: While not extensively studied as a combination, potential interactions are minimal with topical application. However, the doctor needs to be aware of all medications the patient is using, topical or otherwise, to avoid any unforeseen problems.
