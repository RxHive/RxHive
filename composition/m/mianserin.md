# Mianserin
### Generic Name
Mianserin

### Usage
Mianserin is primarily used to treat depressive illness.  It's a tetracyclic antidepressant, meaning it works differently than some of the more common antidepressants like SSRIs or SNRIs.  While its primary use is for depression, it's important to note that it's not a first-line treatment and is typically considered after other options have been explored.  The decision to prescribe mianserin should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who can assess individual needs and risk factors.


### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical starting dose for depression is 30-40mg daily, taken orally.  This dose may be gradually increased by the prescribing physician, as needed, to a maximum of 200mg per day. The maintenance dose usually falls between 30-90mg daily, and can be taken as a single dose or divided into smaller doses throughout the day.  A healthcare provider will determine the optimal dosage and schedule based on individual response and tolerance.

**Children:** Mianserin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents, as its safety and effectiveness haven't been established in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  In patients with mild-to-moderate liver impairment, the manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dose adjustments, but caution is advised.  Mianserin is contraindicated in individuals with severe liver impairment.  For those with renal impairment, no dose adjustment is recommended by the manufacturer, but close monitoring is important.

### How it Works
Mianserin works by affecting several neurotransmitters in the brain. It primarily increases the levels of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation, by blocking alpha-2 autoreceptors and inhibiting its reuptake.  It also interacts with serotonin receptors and has some antagonistic effects on histamine and alpha-1 receptors, which contribute to some of its side effects like sedation and weight gain. The precise mechanism of how mianserin alleviates depression isn't fully understood, but these actions on neurotransmitters are believed to play a significant role.


### Precautions
**Contraindications (situations where mianserin should not be used):**

*   Allergy to mianserin or any of its components
*   Severe liver disease

*   Porphyria (a rare genetic disorder)
*   Concurrent use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)

*   Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure when standing up).
*   Increased risk of bone fractures.
*   Central nervous system depression.
*   Bone marrow suppression.
*   Serotonin syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition).
*   QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias.
*   Use caution in patients with seizures, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or hepatic/renal impairment.
*   Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants.
*   Gradual withdrawal is necessary to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
