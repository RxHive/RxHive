# Manidipine
### Generic Name
Manidipine

### Usage
Manidipine is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure).  Its main function is to lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney disease associated with uncontrolled hypertension.  While not a primary indication, it may be considered in managing certain cardiovascular conditions under strict medical supervision, though this is not always the case and should only be done according to specific medical advice.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical starting dose of Manidipine is 5-10 mg once daily (OD) by mouth.  This dose can be increased gradually, usually every 2-4 weeks, based on the individual's response and tolerance to the medication. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.  Manidipine is usually taken in tablet form after breakfast.  The tablets should not be chewed.

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Manidipine in children have not been established, therefore it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Patients with hepatic (liver) impairment require careful monitoring and may need a reduced dose, and it's contraindicated in those with moderate-to-severe hepatic dysfunction. For those with renal (kidney) impairment, caution is advised, especially with daily doses exceeding 10mg, and use is contraindicated if the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is less than 10 mL/min.


### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Ankle edema (swelling)
* Palpitations
* Edema (swelling)
* Hot flashes

**Less Common (Frequency not specified):**

* Anxiety
* Burning sensation
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Orthostatic effects (dizziness upon standing)
* Facial flushing
* Various skin reactions (e.g., erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis)
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in men)
* Increased serum lipid levels (cholesterol and triglycerides)
* Gastrointestinal issues (abdominal distention, bloating)
* Urinary frequency
* Decreased white blood cell count
* Conjunctival injection (red eyes)
* Increased serum creatinine levels
* Fever


**Serious (Rare, but possible):**  A wide range of less frequent, serious side effects are possible, including but not limited to angina pectoris, myocardial infarction (heart attack), various liver enzyme abnormalities, and other organ-related issues.  It is crucial to consult a doctor immediately if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.


### How it Works
Manidipine is a calcium channel blocker, specifically a dihydropyridine. It works by relaxing blood vessels.  It achieves this by blocking the entry of calcium ions into the muscle cells of blood vessel walls. Reduced calcium influx leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This vasodilation lowers blood pressure.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Manidipine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to Manidipine or other dihydropyridines
* Cardiogenic shock
* Recent myocardial infarction (within 4 weeks) or acute unstable angina
* Severe aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve)
* Pregnancy
* Breastfeeding
* Untreated congestive heart failure
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl <10 mL/min)
* Moderate or severe hepatic impairment

**Interactions:** Manidipine can interact with other medications, notably:

* Other antihypertensive drugs (potential for additive hypotensive effects)
* Insulin and hypoglycemic agents (may affect glucose control)
* Amiodarone (increased risk of bradycardia)
* CYP3A4 inducers (reduced Manidipine effectiveness)
* Yohimbine (reduced Manidipine effectiveness)

**Warnings:**  Manidipine should be used with caution in patients with:

* Poor cardiac reserve
* Porphyria
* Unstable angina or myocardial infarction
* Heart failure
* Hepatic impairment
* Renal impairment
* Galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption
* Elderly patients

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Manidipine?** A:  It's best to avoid excessive alcohol consumption while on Manidipine, as alcohol can lower blood pressure and increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor for specific guidance.

* **Q: How should I store Manidipine?** A: Store Manidipine in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Manidipine suddenly?** A: No.  Sudden discontinuation of Manidipine may lead to rebound hypertension (sudden increase in blood pressure). Consult your doctor before stopping or changing your medication.

* **Q:  Is Manidipine safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** A: No, Manidipine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
