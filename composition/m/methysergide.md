# Methysergide
### Generic Name
Methysergide

### Usage
Methysergide is an ergot derivative primarily used for the prophylactic treatment (prevention) of migraine and other vascular headaches.  Historically, it was also used in the management of carcinoid syndrome, a condition involving the excessive production of serotonin. However, due to significant safety concerns, its use in migraine and carcinoid syndrome is now greatly restricted.  It is no longer a recommended treatment for these conditions because of the serious risks associated with its use.

### Dosage
**Important Note:**  Methysergide is rarely prescribed due to its significant risk of causing retroperitoneal and retropulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the tissues behind the abdominal cavity and lungs).  Any use should only be considered under very strict medical supervision and in exceptional circumstances where the potential benefits significantly outweigh the known risks.  Dosage information provided here is for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.  **Never self-medicate with methysergide.**

Historically, dosages varied depending on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  The usual adult dosage was typically in the range of 2-8mg daily, often divided into multiple doses.  Pediatric dosing was not established. The medication was typically available in tablet form.  Precise dosing instructions were always determined and monitored by a physician.


### Side Effects
The side effects of methysergide can be significant.  Common side effects might include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Weakness
* Drowsiness

More serious, but less frequent, side effects include:

* Retroperitoneal fibrosis (scarring behind the abdominal cavity) – This is a very serious side effect, potentially leading to kidney failure.
* Retropulmonary fibrosis (scarring in the lungs) – This can impair lung function.
* Heart valve problems
* High blood pressure
* Peripheral vascular spasm

**If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works
Methysergide is a serotonin antagonist.  Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in various bodily functions, including the regulation of blood vessels.  By blocking the effects of serotonin, methysergide can cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), which can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches. Its mechanism of action in carcinoid syndrome is related to its ability to antagonize the effects of excess serotonin produced in this condition.

### Precautions
Methysergide carries substantial risks.  It is **contraindicated** (absolutely not recommended) for patients with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or any conditions that might be exacerbated by vasoconstriction.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Methysergide is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential harm to the fetus or infant.
* **Drug Interactions:** Methysergide can interact with other medications, so it's crucial to inform your physician about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to the side effects of methysergide.
* **Renal or Hepatic Impairment:** Methysergide should be used with extreme caution, if at all, in individuals with kidney or liver problems.

**Methysergide should only be used under the strict supervision of a physician due to its serious side-effect profile.**

### FAQs

* **Q: Is methysergide still used to treat migraines?** A:  No, due to the significant risk of retroperitoneal and retropulmonary fibrosis, methysergide is no longer recommended for migraine prophylaxis. Safer and more effective alternatives are available.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Immediately contact your doctor or seek medical attention if you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed above as serious.

* **Q: How should methysergide be stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or physician. Generally, medications should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q:  Can I take methysergide with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to discuss all other medications you're taking with your doctor before starting methysergide, as interactions can occur.

* **Q: Is methysergide safe for long-term use?** A:  No, long-term use is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of serious and potentially life-threatening side effects.
