# Metronidazole

**Generic Name:** Metronidazole

**Usage:** Metronidazole is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial and parasitic infections.  Specific uses include:

* **Bacterial infections:**  Bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),  abdominal infections, skin infections (e.g., cellulitis, abscesses), and some types of pneumonia.
* **Parasitic infections:**  Trichomoniasis, amebiasis (amoebic dysentery), giardiasis.
* **Other uses:**  Metronidazole is also sometimes used to prevent infections after certain surgeries or procedures.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, metronidazole can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, loss of appetite.
* **Neurological:** Headache, dizziness, vertigo, seizures (rare but serious).
* **Skin:**  Rash, itching.
* **Metallic taste:** A distinctive metallic or unpleasant taste in the mouth is a common side effect.
* **Dark urine:**  The urine may turn dark brown or reddish-brown. This is usually harmless.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema), difficulty breathing.
* **Blood disorders:**  Decreased white blood cell count (leukopenia).
* **Peripheral neuropathy:**  Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands and feet.  This can be persistent even after stopping the medication.
* **Seizures:**  Especially in patients with a history of seizures or those with kidney or liver impairment.


**How it Works:** Metronidazole works by disrupting the DNA of bacteria and parasites. This prevents them from multiplying and ultimately kills them. The exact mechanism differs slightly between bacteria and parasites, but the overall effect is to inhibit their growth and reproduction.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking metronidazole?** No.  Alcohol consumption while taking metronidazole can cause a disulfiram-like reaction, characterized by nausea, vomiting, flushing, headache, and palpitations.  Avoid alcohol completely during treatment and for at least 24 hours after completing the course.

* **Is metronidazole safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?**  The safety of metronidazole during pregnancy and breastfeeding is debated and depends on the specific infection and its potential risk to both mother and child.  Always consult your doctor before taking metronidazole if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

* **How long does it take to work?** The time it takes for metronidazole to work varies depending on the infection being treated. Improvement may be noticeable within a few days, but the full course of treatment should be completed as prescribed.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.

* **Can I take metronidazole with other medications?**  Some medications may interact with metronidazole.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all other medications, vitamins, or supplements you are taking.
