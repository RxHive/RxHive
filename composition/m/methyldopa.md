# Methyldopa
### Generic Name
Methyldopa

### Usage
Methyldopa is primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), specifically as an alternative agent or in cases where other medications haven't been effective.  It works by affecting the nervous system's control over blood vessel constriction, leading to lower blood pressure. While its primary use is in adults, it has also been used in some instances for hypertension in children and neonates, though other agents are generally preferred.  It's important to note that methyldopa is not the first-line treatment for hypertension in most cases.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Hypertension (alternative agent):**  Oral administration typically starts with 250 mg two to three times daily for the first 48 hours. The dose is then adjusted (increased or decreased) at intervals of at least two days to find the optimal level, up to a maximum of 3 grams daily in divided doses. When combined with a diuretic, the medication may be given once daily. Intravenous administration for hypertension involves doses of 250-1000 mg every 6-8 hours, with a maximum of 1000 mg four times daily.
* **Hypertensive Crisis:** Intravenous administration in hypertensive crises uses a higher dose, typically 20-40 mg/kg/day given every six hours, up to a maximum of 65 mg/kg/day or 3 grams daily, whichever is lower.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

*The use of methyldopa in children is generally avoided in favor of other antihypertensive agents.*  However, in specific situations where other treatments aren't suitable, the dosage is determined by the healthcare provider based on the child's weight and age and the severity of the condition.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Methyldopa is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.
* **Renal Impairment:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for renal impairment, but alternative guidelines suggest dose adjustments based on creatinine clearance.

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Sedation (sleepiness)
* Nausea
* Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing)

Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* Liver damage (hepatitis, jaundice)
* Hemolytic anemia (breakdown of red blood cells)
* Depression
* Parkinson's-like symptoms
* Positive Coombs test (a blood test that can indicate anemia)


If any side effects occur, especially serious ones, it is crucial to contact a doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Methyldopa works by stimulating alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the brain.  This reduces the signals sent from the brain that cause blood vessels to constrict, thus lowering blood pressure. Another possibility is that it produces a "false" neurotransmitter (alpha-methylnorepinephrine) that also decreases sympathetic nervous system activity and blood pressure.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methyldopa is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, pheochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland), porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting the production of heme), active liver disease, or those concurrently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
* **Interactions:** Methyldopa can interact with numerous other medications, including other antihypertensives, antidepressants, beta-blockers, MAOIs, and others.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Methyldopa is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning it is considered relatively safe but has limited data.  It can be considered if other antihypertensives arenâ€™t suitable, although other drugs might be preferred due to potential side effects. Methyldopa is excreted in breast milk; the decision to use it during breastfeeding should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional, weighing the benefits against the risks.
* **Specific Populations:** Older adults, individuals with liver or kidney disease, and those with heart conditions should use methyldopa with caution under close medical supervision.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for methyldopa to work?** A: The onset of action varies, but significant blood pressure reduction typically happens within a few days to several weeks.  It may take time to find the right dosage.

* **Q: Can I stop taking methyldopa suddenly?** A: No, stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound effect, causing a sudden increase in blood pressure.  Always taper off methyldopa under the guidance of your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose.  Do not double up doses.

* **Q: How should I store methyldopa?** A: Store methyldopa at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is methyldopa addictive?** A: No, methyldopa is not considered an addictive substance.
