# Methaqualone
### Generic Name
Methaqualone

### Usage
Methaqualone is a central nervous system depressant that was previously used as a hypnotic and sedative, primarily to treat insomnia.  However, due to its high potential for abuse and dependence, methaqualone has been withdrawn from the market in most countries and is no longer considered an appropriate treatment for insomnia or any other condition.  Its use is strictly regulated and in many places completely prohibited.  Any past use of methaqualone, even in combination with other drugs like diphenhydramine, is now strongly discouraged due to safety concerns.

### Dosage
Because methaqualone is no longer legally available for prescription in most parts of the world, providing dosage information would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous.  Any information found regarding dosage should be disregarded as it pertains to a medication that is no longer considered safe for use and is often illegally produced and sold.  

### Side Effects
Due to the significant risks associated with methaqualone, it's crucial to understand potential side effects, even if the drug isn't currently prescribed.  While specific incidence rates are not readily available for a medication no longer in legitimate use, past reports have included:

* **Common:** Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, and impaired coordination.
* **Less Common, but Serious:**  Respiratory depression, hypotension (low blood pressure), paradoxical excitement (agitation instead of sedation), allergic reactions, and potentially fatal overdose.

**If you experience any adverse effects after taking methaqualone (illegally obtained), seek immediate medical attention.**


### How it Works
Methaqualone acts as a central nervous system depressant primarily by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. GABA is a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses, leading to a calming effect.  By increasing GABA activity, methaqualone slows down brain activity, causing sedation and sleepiness.  This mechanism also affects other bodily functions, slowing heart rate and respiration, which contributes to its risk of overdose.


### Precautions
**Methaqualone is a highly dangerous and addictive drug.  It should never be used without explicit instruction from a qualified medical professional, and given its removal from the market, this is essentially never the case.**

* **Contraindications:**  Methaqualone is contraindicated for individuals with respiratory conditions, liver or kidney disease, or a history of substance abuse.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The interaction of methaqualone with other central nervous system depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines) is extremely dangerous and can lead to respiratory depression and death.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Methaqualone use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is highly risky and should be avoided completely.
* **Elderly and Children:**  The elderly and children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of methaqualone and should never be exposed to it.
