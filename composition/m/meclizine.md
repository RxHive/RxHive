# Meclizine
### Generic Name
Meclizine

### Usage

Meclizine is primarily used to treat vertigo (a sensation of spinning or dizziness) associated with inner ear problems (vestibular disorders).  It's also effective in preventing and treating nausea, vomiting, and dizziness related to motion sickness.  While not its primary use, Meclizine can sometimes be used to manage nausea and vomiting caused by radiation therapy.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully.

**Adults:**

* **Motion sickness (prevention and treatment):** 25-50 mg orally one hour before travel, and repeated every 24 hours as needed. The maximum daily dose is 50 mg.
* **Vertigo/Vestibular disorders:** 25-100 mg daily, divided into doses. The exact dosage will be determined by your doctor.
* **Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting:** 50 mg orally 2-12 hours before radiotherapy.

**Children:**

Dosage for children should be determined by a physician and is based on age and weight.  Generally, children aged 2-6 years may receive 6.25 mg once daily, children aged 6-12 years might receive 12.5 mg once daily, while children 12 years and older may receive a dosage similar to adults, as determined by their physician.


**Important Note:**  The above are general guidelines.  Your healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage based on your individual needs and health status.  Never exceed the recommended dosage. Meclizine is usually available in tablet form.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of Meclizine can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Vomiting

Less common, but more serious side effects may include difficulty urinating, and worsening of glaucoma symptoms.  If you experience any serious or unusual side effects, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Meclizine is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties.  While its exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed to work by blocking histamine receptors in the brain and affecting the signals that cause vertigo and nausea. This action helps to reduce the symptoms of motion sickness and vestibular disorders.  The anticholinergic properties further contribute to its antiemetic effects.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Meclizine is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Meclizine or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Meclizine can increase the effects of central nervous system (CNS) depressants like alcohol, sedatives, or tranquilizers. Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking Meclizine.
* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary tract obstruction, asthma, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, renal or hepatic impairment, or those taking other medications affecting the CNS.  Meclizine can cause drowsiness, so avoid operating machinery or driving until you know how it affects you.  It should be used cautiously in elderly patients.  The use of Meclizine during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful assessment of risks and benefits by the attending physician.

### FAQs
