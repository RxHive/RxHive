# Meclizine

**Generic Name:** Meclizine

**Usage:**

Meclizine is an antihistamine used to prevent and treat nausea, vomiting, and dizziness (vertigo) associated with motion sickness. It's also sometimes used to treat vertigo from inner ear problems (labyrinthitis or Meniere's disease).  It's available over-the-counter (OTC) for motion sickness and sometimes requires a prescription for vertigo treatment.  It should be taken as directed on the packaging or by a doctor.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Difficulty urinating

Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Fast or irregular heartbeat
* Seizures
* Severe drowsiness or coma


**How it Works:**

Meclizine works by blocking the effects of histamine in the brain. Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in several bodily functions, including the balance system in the inner ear and the vomiting center in the brain. By blocking histamine, meclizine reduces the signals that trigger nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.  It's thought it may also have effects on other neurotransmitters in the central nervous system that contribute to these symptoms.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking meclizine?**  Alcohol can worsen the drowsiness and other side effects of meclizine, so it's best to avoid alcohol while taking it.
* **Can I take meclizine with other medications?**  It's important to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements, as interactions are possible.  It's particularly important to mention other medications that cause drowsiness.
* **How long does it take to work?**  For motion sickness, it's usually recommended to take meclizine 30-60 minutes before travel. For vertigo, the onset of effect may vary.
* **How long can I take meclizine?**  For motion sickness, it's typically used only when needed. For vertigo, the duration of treatment will depend on the underlying condition and should be determined by a doctor.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.
* **Is meclizine safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?**  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking meclizine, as the safety of use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any severe or concerning side effects, stop taking meclizine and seek medical attention immediately.  For milder side effects, you may continue treatment and inform your doctor during your next visit.
