# Mefenamic Acid + Dicyclomine + Dimethicone

**Generic Name:** Mefenamic Acid + Dicyclomine + Dimethicone

**Usage:** This combination medication is typically used to relieve symptoms associated with painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea).  Mefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation. Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic that helps relax the muscles in the abdomen, reducing cramping. Dimethicone is an anti-foaming agent that can help relieve gas and bloating, which are sometimes associated with menstrual cramps.  **Important Note:** This combination is not FDA-approved in the US and its availability and use vary by region.  Consult a doctor before using this medication.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on individual sensitivity and the dosages of each component.  Possible side effects include:

* **From Mefenamic Acid:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, heartburn, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash, ringing in the ears (tinnitus).  Rare but serious side effects include allergic reactions, kidney problems, liver problems, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
* **From Dicyclomine:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, drowsiness, dizziness.
* **From Dimethicone:** Generally well-tolerated, with minimal side effects.  Rarely, mild gastrointestinal upset might occur.

The combination of these drugs can increase the risk of some side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues.

**How it Works:**

* **Mefenamic Acid:** Reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, hormones that contribute to pain and inflammation during menstruation.
* **Dicyclomine:** Relaxes the smooth muscles in the abdomen, reducing cramping and spasms.
* **Dimethicone:**  Reduces gas and bloating by breaking up gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract.
