# Mequitazine
### Generic Name
Mequitazine

### Usage
Mequitazine is a second-generation antihistamine primarily used to treat the symptoms of allergic conditions.  These include seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever), conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eye), urticaria (hives), and pruritus (itching).  It's effective in relieving symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and skin rashes associated with allergies.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Allergy Symptoms):** The usual oral dose is 10 mg per day, taken in two divided doses or as a single dose in the evening.

**Pediatric Dosage (Allergy Symptoms):**  Mequitazine tablets are not suitable for children under 6 years of age. For children aged 2 years and older, a syrup formulation is available. The dosage is calculated based on weight:

* Children weighing less than 40 kg: 0.25 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses or given as a single evening dose.
* Children weighing 40 kg or more:  The same dosage as adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to the potential for drug accumulation.  Always consult a healthcare professional before adjusting the dosage.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* **Nervous System:** Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, fatigue, nervousness, insomnia, and rarely, more serious effects like seizures or hallucinations.
* **Cardiovascular:**  Palpitations, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), hypotension (low blood pressure).  Rarely, more serious effects such as cardiac arrhythmias or torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat) can occur, especially with concomitant use of certain medications (see Interactions).
* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth.
* **Dermatological:** Rash, itching, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).
* **Other:**  Blurred vision, urinary retention, increased thirst.


Less common but serious side effects include agranulocytosis (a severe decrease in white blood cells), hemolytic anemia, and other blood disorders.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or unusual side effects.**


### How it Works

Mequitazine works by blocking histamine H1 receptors. Histamine is a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction, causing the characteristic symptoms. By blocking these receptors, mequitazine prevents histamine from triggering these symptoms, providing relief from allergy manifestations. It also possesses anticholinergic properties, although this is a secondary effect.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mequitazine is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to mequitazine or related compounds, a history of agranulocytosis with phenothiazine use, bradycardia (slow heart rate), coma, concomitant use with MAO inhibitors or large doses of CNS depressants, epilepsy, hepatitis, breastfeeding, obstructive urinary tract diseases, congenital long QT syndrome, risk of QT prolongation, children under 2 years old, and angle-closure glaucoma.
* **Interactions:**  Mequitazine can interact with several other medications.  It can enhance the effects of CNS depressants (such as alcohol, opioids, sedatives, and hypnotics). Concomitant use with certain antibiotics (e.g., macrolides) may increase the risk of QT prolongation.  Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking mequitazine.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Mequitazine should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Special Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, hepatic impairment, myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's disease, asthma/COPD, a history of seizures, sleep apnea, elderly patients, blood dyscrasias, and those at risk of pneumonia.
