# Metolazone
### Generic Name
Metolazone

### Usage
Metolazone is a powerful diuretic (water pill) primarily used to treat edema (fluid retention) associated with various conditions like heart failure and kidney diseases, including nephrotic syndrome.  It's particularly useful in cases where other diuretics have proven insufficient. Metolazone is also used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), either alone or in combination with other blood pressure-lowering medications.  Its long-acting nature makes it a convenient option for managing these conditions.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the condition being treated, the patient's age and overall health, and response to the medication.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.  The following are general guidelines and should not be interpreted as a substitute for professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Edema (due to heart failure or kidney disease):**  Initial doses usually range from 2.5mg to 20mg once daily, potentially increased gradually to a maximum of 80mg per day, depending on the response and physician's judgment.  Elderly patients may start with lower doses (e.g., 2.5mg every other day).
* **Hypertension:** Initial doses are typically lower, starting at 1.25mg daily and adjusted upwards after several weeks based on blood pressure readings.  Usual maintenance doses might range from 2.5mg to 5mg daily.  Elderly individuals often begin with lower doses.

**Children:**

Metolazone use in children is less common and usually only considered for refractory edema (fluid retention that hasn't responded to other treatments), often in conjunction with other diuretics like furosemide.  Dosage is determined based on body weight (typically 0.2-0.4mg/kg/day).

**Administration:** Metolazone is usually administered orally as a tablet, once daily. Taking the medication in the morning is usually recommended to reduce nighttime urination (nocturia).

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal and hepatic impairment may necessitate dosage adjustments or even contraindicate the use of metolazone.  Always inform your doctor about any kidney or liver problems before starting this medication.

### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Lightheadedness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth
* Muscle cramps
* Weakness

Less common, but potentially serious side effects can include:

* Severe allergic reactions (angioedema, bronchospasm)
* Dehydration
* Electrolyte imbalances (low potassium, sodium, magnesium)
* Increased blood sugar levels
* Photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Changes in kidney function


If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately consult your healthcare provider.

### How it Works

Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic. It works by affecting how the kidneys handle sodium and water.  It primarily acts on the distal tubules of the kidneys, preventing the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions. This increase in sodium and chloride excretion leads to increased water excretion, reducing fluid retention and lowering blood pressure.  The increased excretion of sodium also affects potassium levels, potentially leading to low potassium levels (hypokalemia) in some individuals.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** Metolazone is contraindicated in individuals with known allergies to metolazone or sulfonamides.  Cross-sensitivity with sulfa drugs is possible.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Metolazone should be used cautiously in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.  It is contraindicated in cases of anuria (absence of urine production) and hepatic coma or precoma.
* **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Metolazone can lead to electrolyte imbalances. Regular monitoring of potassium, sodium, and other electrolytes is usually necessary.
* **Diabetes and Gout:** Metolazone may worsen diabetes or gout.  Close monitoring of blood sugar and uric acid levels is essential for patients with these conditions.
* **Interactions:** Metolazone may interact with many medications, including ACE inhibitors, lithium, and certain other diuretics.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of metolazone during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Consult your doctor to discuss the risks and benefits before using it during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Elderly:** Elderly individuals may require lower doses due to increased sensitivity.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take metolazone with alcohol?** A:  No, it's generally advised to avoid alcohol while on metolazone, as it can worsen dehydration and side effects.
* **Q: How should I store metolazone?** A: Store metolazone tablets in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of children's reach.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Don't double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Can I stop taking metolazone suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping metolazone may lead to a rebound effect and worsening of your condition. Always follow your doctor's instructions on how to gradually discontinue the medication.
* **Q: Does metolazone cause weight loss?** A:  While metolazone can cause fluid loss and hence temporary weight reduction, it is not intended for weight loss. The primary purpose is to treat fluid retention and/or hypertension.
