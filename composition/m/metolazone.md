# Metolazone

**Generic Name:** Metolazone

**Usage:**

Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic (water pill) used to treat:

* **High blood pressure (hypertension):** It helps to lower blood pressure by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body.  It's often used in combination with other blood pressure medications.
* **Fluid retention (edema):**  It can help reduce fluid buildup associated with conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and kidney disease.
* **Treatment of edema associated with nephrotic syndrome:** Helps reduce swelling related to this kidney disorder.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Dehydration:**  Due to increased urination. Symptoms can include dizziness, lightheadedness, and weakness.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  This can lead to low potassium (hypokalemia), low sodium (hyponatremia), low magnesium (hypomagnesemia), and high calcium (hypercalcemia).  Symptoms can vary depending on the electrolyte affected.
* **Dizziness and lightheadedness:** Particularly when standing up quickly (orthostatic hypotension).
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea and vomiting:**
* **Muscle cramps:**  Often related to low potassium.
* **Increased blood sugar:** Can worsen diabetes.
* **Increased uric acid:** Can worsen gout.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.
* **Jaundice:** Yellowing of skin and eyes.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas.


**How it Works:**

Metolazone works by affecting the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium and water.  It inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, a part of the kidney responsible for filtering blood.  By preventing the reabsorption of sodium, it increases the excretion of sodium and water in the urine, thus lowering blood pressure and reducing fluid retention. It is more potent than thiazide diuretics.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take metolazone with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications, especially those that affect potassium levels, can interact with metolazone.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't take two doses at once.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking metolazone?**  Alcohol can increase the risk of dehydration and low blood pressure. It's best to limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of metolazone may not be noticeable immediately. It may take several days or weeks to see a significant improvement in blood pressure or fluid retention.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or any other signs of an allergic reaction.
* **Can metolazone cause weight loss?** While it can reduce fluid retention, leading to temporary weight loss, metolazone is not a weight-loss medication.
* **Is metolazone safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  The safety of metolazone during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult your doctor before taking this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
