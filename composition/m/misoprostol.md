# Misoprostol
### Generic Name
Misoprostol

### Usage

Misoprostol is primarily used for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.  However, it's also used, off-label, in several other applications, most notably for the medical termination of pregnancy (often in combination with mifepristone) and in managing postpartum hemorrhage.  Other off-label uses include the treatment of incomplete abortion, missed abortion, labor induction, cervical ripening, and the treatment of fat malabsorption in cystic fibrosis patients (in children older than 8 years).  The use of misoprostol in pregnancy is strictly regulated due to its potential risks.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the indication and the route of administration (oral, sublingual, buccal, vaginal, or rectal).  Precise dosing instructions should always come from a healthcare professional. The following is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

* **Medical Termination of Pregnancy (in conjunction with mifepristone):** Dosages vary depending on gestational age and specific guidelines (e.g., WHO, ACOG).  Typically, misoprostol (800 mcg) is administered vaginally, buccally, or sublingually 24-48 hours after mifepristone. Specific protocols should be followed.

* **Incomplete/Missed Abortion (off-label):**  Dosages vary depending on the route of administration (oral or vaginal). Usually, a single dose is given, followed by further doses if necessary, based on clinical assessment.

* **Labor Induction/Cervical Ripening (off-label):** Low doses (25 mcg intravaginally or 20-25 mcg orally) are used, and the frequency of administration depends on the clinical response.

* **Postpartum Hemorrhage (off-label):** Dosages range from 600 mcg to 1000 mcg, administered orally or sublingually.

* **Prevention of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers:**  Typically, 200 mcg is administered orally four times daily with food.

**Children:**  The use of misoprostol in children is limited to off-label treatment of fat malabsorption in cystic fibrosis patients (over 8 years old) at a dose of 100 mcg four times a day.  Always follow healthcare professional guidance.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache

Less common, but serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Uterine rupture (especially in pregnancy)
* Excessive bleeding
* Cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke)
* Hepatobiliary dysfunction

Any unusual or concerning side effects should be reported to a doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog.  In the context of NSAID-induced ulcer prevention, it replaces the protective prostaglandins that NSAIDs inhibit, thus reducing the risk of ulcers. In inducing uterine contractions (used in medical abortion and labor induction), it stimulates uterine muscle contractions leading to expulsion of uterine contents.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnancy (except when specifically used for medical termination of pregnancy under strict medical supervision). It can cause birth defects, miscarriage, premature birth, or uterine rupture.
* **Breastfeeding:** Misoprostol is excreted in breast milk.  Consult a healthcare professional.
* **Interactions:** Misoprostol may enhance the effects of oxytocin and other uterotonic drugs. Magnesium-containing antacids may worsen diarrhea.
* **Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatic or renal impairment, respiratory disease:**  Use with caution in patients with these conditions.
* **Prior uterine surgery:**  Increased risk of uterine rupture, especially in pregnancy-related uses.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Misoprostol with other medications?**  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications.
* **How should I store Misoprostol?** Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Consult your healthcare provider for instructions.
* **Is Misoprostol safe for everyone?**  No, it has several contraindications and precautions, particularly regarding pregnancy and certain pre-existing health conditions.
* **What if I experience severe bleeding?** Seek immediate medical attention.
