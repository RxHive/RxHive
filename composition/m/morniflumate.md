# Morniflumate
### Generic Name
Morniflumate

### Usage
Morniflumate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and analgesic used to manage pain and inflammation. Its primary use is in treating pain and inflammation associated with upper respiratory tract infections (like laryngitis, tracheitis, or bronchitis) and otolaryngologic diseases (such as sinusitis, otitis, tonsillitis, or pharyngitis).  It's also indicated for the management of osteoarthropathy pain and inflammation.


### Dosage

**Adults:**  The typical starting dose for pain and inflammation is 350 mg twice daily (BID).  This may be increased to 700 mg BID if necessary, as determined by a healthcare professional.  The medication should be taken orally, with food or after a meal, and with plenty of water to minimize potential esophageal irritation.  Do not crush or chew the tablets.

**Children:** Morniflumate is **contraindicated** in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling; however,  use should be cautious, and the medication should be discontinued if hepatic function worsens or signs/symptoms of acute hepatic failure appear.  Morniflumate is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment, and those with severe heart failure or hypertension.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Gastrointestinal issues: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, stomach pain, constipation, dyspepsia.
* Nervous system effects: Headache, dizziness, drowsiness.

Less common, but serious side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions: Anaphylaxis, angioedema.
* Cardiovascular problems:  Myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, edema.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.
* Liver damage (hepatitis, increased liver enzymes).
* Kidney problems (renal failure, decreased urine output).
* Blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia).
* Skin reactions: Rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.


**If you experience any of these side effects, especially severe or persistent ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**  This list is not exhaustive, and other side effects may occur.

### How it Works

Morniflumate and its active metabolite, niflumic acid, work by selectively inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes.  COX-2 enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking COX-2, Morniflumate reduces the production of these inflammatory mediators, thus alleviating pain and inflammation.


### Precautions

It is also contraindicated for perioperative pain management in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.
