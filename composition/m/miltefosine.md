# Miltefosine
### Generic Name
Miltefosine

### Usage
Miltefosine is an antiparasitic medication primarily used to treat leishmaniasis, a disease caused by parasites of the *Leishmania* genus.  It's effective against both visceral leishmaniasis (also known as kala-azar), a severe form affecting internal organs, and cutaneous leishmaniasis, which primarily affects the skin.  While its primary use is in treating leishmaniasis,  research is ongoing to explore its potential in other parasitic infections.

### Dosage

Dosage of miltefosine varies depending on the type of leishmaniasis being treated, the patient's weight and age, and the specific treatment guidelines followed (e.g., those recommended by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) in India).  Always follow the prescription instructions precisely.  

**Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar):**

* **Adults (Weight > 25 kg):**  The standard NVBDCP India regimen is 50 mg twice daily (morning and evening) for 28 days.  This is typically administered under directly observed therapy (DOT), meaning a healthcare professional supervises medication intake.
* **Adults (Weight < 25 kg):** The standard NVBDCP India regimen is 50 mg once daily (morning) for 28 days under DOT.
* **Children (aged 2-12 years):** The standard NVBDCP India regimen is 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days under DOT.
* **Children (aged > 12 years):**  The same dosage as for adults is typically used.

**Cutaneous Leishmaniasis:** Dosage regimens for cutaneous leishmaniasis vary and should be determined by a physician based on individual needs.

**Important Note:**  There are currently no established dosage adjustments for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  The safety and efficacy in these populations haven't been fully established.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Decreased appetite
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Abdominal pain
* Increased liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
* Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia)

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a serious skin reaction)
* Increased serum creatinine (indicating potential kidney problems)
* Severe vomiting or diarrhea leading to dehydration

If you experience any adverse effects, particularly those listed above, consult your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Miltefosine's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to work by interfering with the parasite's cellular processes.  It interacts with lipids (fats) within the *Leishmania* parasite's cell membranes, disrupting their structure and function. This leads to impaired parasite growth and ultimately, parasite death.  It also may affect the parasite's mitochondria (the cell's energy-producing centers), and trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the parasite.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy:** Miltefosine is categorized as a pregnancy Category D drug, meaning it poses a significant risk of fetal harm. It's contraindicated (absolutely not to be used) during pregnancy.  Women of childbearing age should undergo pregnancy testing before starting treatment and use effective contraception during and for 5 months after treatment.
* **Breastfeeding:** It's unknown whether miltefosine is excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment.
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments have not been established for individuals with liver or kidney disease.  Caution is needed, and close monitoring is recommended.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor about all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, as interactions are possible.
* **Hypersensitivity:**  Avoid using miltefosine if you have a known allergy to it or any of its ingredients.
* **Sj√∂gren-Larsson syndrome:** Miltefosine is contraindicated in individuals with this rare genetic disorder.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take miltefosine with food?** A: Yes, taking miltefosine with food can help reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

* **Q: How long does treatment with miltefosine last?** A: The typical treatment duration for visceral leishmaniasis is 28 days, but this can vary depending on the individual case and treatment guidelines.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor immediately.  Do not attempt to double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store miltefosine?** A: Store miltefosine as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Are there long-term effects associated with miltefosine?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully understood and ongoing research is needed. Close monitoring is crucial during and after treatment.
