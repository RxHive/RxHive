# Methscopolamine
### Generic Name
Methscopolamine

### Usage
Methscopolamine is primarily used as an adjunct in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease.  It helps to reduce the amount of acid produced in the stomach and decreases stomach motility, thereby aiding in the healing process of ulcers.  It's important to note that methscopolamine is used *in conjunction with* other ulcer treatments, not as a standalone therapy.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For peptic ulcer disease, the typical adult dosage is 2.5 mg orally every 8 hours after meals (PC) and 2.5-5 mg orally at bedtime (qHS), resulting in four doses daily.  The dose may be increased to 5 mg per dose, but the maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of methscopolamine in children have not been established.  It is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Therefore, methscopolamine should be used with caution in these patient populations.  Close monitoring is necessary.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of methscopolamine can include:

* Blurred vision
* Cycloplegia (paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye)
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Loss of taste
* Urinary retention
* Allergic reactions (rare but possible)


Serious side effects, while less common, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, seek medical attention promptly.

### How it Works
Methscopolamine is an anticholinergic agent.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the muscles and glands in the body, including those in the stomach.  By blocking acetylcholine, methscopolamine reduces stomach acid secretion, slows down the rate of gastric emptying, and decreases gastrointestinal motility. This combination helps to decrease irritation and promote ulcer healing.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Methscopolamine is contraindicated in patients with:

* Hypersensitivity to methscopolamine or related drugs.
* Glaucoma
* Obstructive uropathy (e.g., bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy)
* Obstructive gastrointestinal disease (e.g., pyloroduodenal stenosis)
* Paralytic ileus
* Intestinal atony (especially in elderly or debilitated patients)
* Unstable cardiovascular status with acute hemorrhage
* Severe ulcerative colitis
* Toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis
* Myasthenia gravis


**Warnings:** Methscopolamine can increase the risk of drowsiness, blurred vision, diarrhea, and heat prostration.  It should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, neuropathy, prostatic hyperplasia, and ulcerative colitis.

**Drug Interactions:** Methscopolamine can interact with numerous other medications, particularly those with anticholinergic properties or those affecting gastrointestinal motility.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting methscopolamine therapy.  The provided details show numerous drug interactions and the clinical significance of each interaction.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for details on drug interactions.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Methscopolamine is categorized as pregnancy category C.  It is not known whether methscopolamine is secreted in breast milk.  Therefore, it should be used with caution during pregnancy and lactation, only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  A doctor should be consulted before using methscopolamine during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
