# Montelukast + Fexofenadine
### Generic Name
Montelukast + Fexofenadine (Combination)

**Note:**  Montelukast and Fexofenadine are typically prescribed as separate medications.  A fixed-dose combination product containing both is not as commonly available as individual formulations.  This information describes the effects and considerations for each drug *when used together*, as prescribed by a doctor.  It's crucial to follow your doctor's specific instructions for dosage and administration.


### Usage

This combination medication is typically prescribed to manage symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma.  It combines the actions of two different classes of drugs:

* **Montelukast:** This is a leukotriene receptor antagonist.  It works by blocking the action of leukotrienes, substances in the body that trigger inflammation and constriction of the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. In allergic rhinitis, it helps reduce nasal congestion, sneezing, and itching.

* **Fexofenadine:** This is a second-generation antihistamine. It blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body in response to allergens. Histamine causes many allergic symptoms, including runny nose, sneezing, itching, and hives.  Fexofenadine is less likely to cause drowsiness than older antihistamines.


Therefore, the combined use of montelukast and fexofenadine aims to provide broader symptom control for allergies and asthma by targeting both inflammation (montelukast) and histamine-mediated reactions (fexofenadine).


### Dosage

Dosage for both montelukast and fexofenadine will vary depending on the individual's age, weight, and specific medical conditions.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dose.  There is no standard "combination" dosage, as prescriptions are for each drug individually.  Therefore, specific instructions on dosage and administration need to come directly from your physician or pharmacist.


* **Montelukast:**  Available in chewable tablets, oral granules, and tablets for adults and children. Doses vary by age and weight. Always follow the prescribed dosage carefully.

* **Fexofenadine:** Available as tablets and capsules. Doses usually range from 60mg to 180mg daily, depending on the severity of symptoms and individual response.

**Important Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works

As described above, montelukast blocks leukotrienes, reducing airway inflammation and narrowing, thus relieving asthma symptoms.  Fexofenadine blocks histamine receptors, preventing histamine from causing allergic symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Together, they provide a more comprehensive approach to managing allergy and asthma symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before taking either medication if pregnant or breastfeeding.

* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with liver or kidney impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Both montelukast and fexofenadine can interact with other medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Age:**  Dosage should be tailored to the age and weight of the patient, particularly for children.

* **Driving and Operating Machinery:** Fexofenadine is generally considered safe, but some individuals might experience drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.

* **Allergies:**  Inform your doctor of any known drug allergies.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take this combination without a doctor's prescription?**  A: No.  Both montelukast and fexofenadine should only be taken as prescribed by a physician.

* **Q: How long does it take for the medication to work?** A: The onset of action varies.  For immediate relief from symptoms, fexofenadine is usually faster-acting.  Montelukast takes longer to show a full effect, often requiring several days of consistent use.
