# Montelukast + Fexofenadine

**Generic Name:** Montelukast + Fexofenadine (combination product; individual components are Montelukast sodium and Fexofenadine hydrochloride)

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and perennial allergic rhinitis (year-round allergies).  It combines a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast) and an antihistamine (fexofenadine) to provide broader symptom control.  It's typically prescribed for adults and children (age varies depending on specific formulation and doctor's recommendation) experiencing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion.  It may also be used to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in some cases, though this is usually handled with montelukast alone.  **It's crucial to consult a doctor before using this or any medication.** The specific usage will be determined by a medical professional based on the individual's needs and medical history.

**Side Effects:** Side effects can vary from person to person and may include:

* **Common:** Headache, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue.
* **Less Common:**  Upper respiratory tract infection, sore throat, cough, back pain, muscle pain, insomnia.
* **Rare but Serious:**  These are uncommon but require immediate medical attention.  They include allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), liver problems, changes in mood or behavior, and serious cardiovascular events (though this is more associated with high doses and pre-existing conditions).  A complete list should be reviewed with the prescribing physician or pharmacist.


**How it Works:**

* **Montelukast (Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist):**  Leukotrienes are substances produced by the body during an allergic reaction, causing inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Montelukast blocks the action of these leukotrienes, reducing inflammation and improving airflow in the lungs and reducing nasal congestion.

* **Fexofenadine (Antihistamine):** Histamines are another substance released during allergic reactions causing symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and hives. Fexofenadine blocks the action of histamines, relieving these allergic symptoms.


The combination of montelukast and fexofenadine provides a more comprehensive approach to allergy symptom relief, targeting both leukotrienes and histamines.
