# Mometasone + Formoterol
### Generic Name
Mometasone + Formoterol

### Usage
The combination of mometasone (a corticosteroid) and formoterol (a long-acting beta-2 agonist) is primarily used for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 5 years and older.  It's specifically indicated for patients whose asthma isn't adequately controlled with a long-term asthma control medication like an inhaled corticosteroid alone, or for those needing both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-2 agonist.  This combination is *not* intended for the quick relief of acute asthma attacks (bronchospasm).  It is sometimes used off-label for the management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

### Dosage

**Adults (Asthma & COPD):** The usual dosage is two inhalations twice daily (morning and evening).  Available strengths include mometasone 100 mcg/formoterol 5 mcg and mometasone 200 mcg/formoterol 5 mcg. The starting dose depends on asthma severity and prior treatment.  The maximum daily dose is 800 mcg of mometasone and 20 mcg of formoterol, achieved with two inhalations of the 200 mcg/5 mcg formulation twice daily.  Dosage should be titrated down to the lowest effective dose once asthma is well controlled.

**Children (Asthma):**

* **Ages 5 to under 12 years:**  The usual dose is two inhalations twice daily of mometasone 50 mcg/formoterol 5 mcg. The maximum daily dose is 200 mcg mometasone and 20 mcg formoterol.  The dose may be increased after two weeks if adequate control isn't achieved.
* **Ages 12 years and older:** The dosage is similar to adults, using either the 100 mcg/5 mcg or 200 mcg/5 mcg strength.  The maximum daily dose remains the same as for adults.

**Important Administration Notes:** Always shake the inhaler well before each use. Rinse the mouth with water after each dose and spit out the water to minimize the risk of thrush (oral candidiasis).  The inhaler should be primed before first use and if unused for more than 5 days.

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Mometasone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation in the airways.  It works by suppressing the activity of various inflammatory cells and mediators involved in asthma. Formoterol, a long-acting beta-2 agonist, relaxes the muscles surrounding the airways, making it easier to breathe.  It achieves this by binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs, leading to increased cyclic AMP levels and smooth muscle relaxation.  The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating effects, resulting in improved asthma control.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Mometasone/formoterol is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to either component, those experiencing a severe asthma attack (status asthmaticus), untreated infections, cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and active tuberculous infection of the respiratory tract or ocular herpes simplex.
* **Interactions:**  CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase mometasone levels.  Concurrent use with other adrenergic agents, xanthine derivatives, diuretics, MAO inhibitors, TCAs, drugs prolonging the QTc interval, beta-blockers, and halogenated hydrocarbons requires careful monitoring.
* **Warnings:**  Increased risk of serious asthma events, hypercorticism, adrenal suppression, paradoxical bronchospasm, immunosuppression, hypersensitivity reactions, and other adverse effects. Use caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, bone mineral density issues, or those on potassium-sparing diuretics.  Close monitoring is necessary in children for growth effects.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding safety aren't fully established.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this for a sudden asthma attack?**  A: No, this medication is for long-term maintenance and not for acute relief of symptoms.  Use a short-acting beta-2 agonist inhaler for immediate relief.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  You may notice some improvement within 5 minutes, but the full benefit may take a week or longer.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, always talk to your doctor before stopping or changing your dosage. Stopping abruptly can lead to a return of your symptoms.
