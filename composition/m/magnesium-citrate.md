# Magnesium Citrate
### Generic Name
Magnesium Citrate

### Usage
Magnesium citrate is primarily used as a saline laxative to treat occasional constipation.  It works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and increasing bowel movements.  A secondary, less common use is in managing oxaluria, a condition characterized by excessive oxalate excretion in the urine.  It's also sometimes used off-label as a bowel preparation before colonoscopies, although this use requires careful consideration due to potential risks (see Precautions).

### Dosage

**Note:**  The amount of elemental magnesium in magnesium citrate varies depending on the formulation. Always refer to the specific product labeling for accurate elemental magnesium content.  The following dosages are guidelines and may need adjustment based on individual needs and physician recommendations.

**Adults:**

* **Occasional Constipation:**  The typical dose is 195-300 mL of solution taken as a single dose or in divided doses.  Effervescent powder formulations may have different dosing instructions (typically 2.125g three times daily).
* **Oxaluria:**  Similar to constipation treatment, the usual dose involves 2.125g of effervescent powder three times a day.
* **Bowel Preparation (Off-label):** There's no standardized dose for bowel preparation.  Different protocols exist, involving single or split doses (typically 1.5 to 450mL of solution at specific times before the procedure) along with clear liquids.  Always consult a healthcare professional for appropriate instructions.

**Children:**

The use of magnesium citrate in children is generally discouraged in favor of other, safer laxatives due to the risk of electrolyte imbalances.  If prescribed, the dosage will be significantly lower than for adults and determined by a doctor based on the child's age and weight.  The general range is 4-6 mL/kg/day for bowel preparation in children over 6 years old, with a maximum daily dose of 300 mL.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with renal (kidney) impairment, as magnesium is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Caution is paramount in individuals with liver or kidney disease.  Always consult with a doctor before using magnesium citrate in such cases.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Electrolyte imbalances (especially with excessive use or kidney impairment), dehydration.

**Important:** Stop using magnesium citrate and contact a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any severe or persistent side effects.


### How it Works
Magnesium citrate acts as an osmotic laxative.  When ingested, it draws water into the intestines, increasing the bulk and fluidity of the stool.  This increased volume stimulates bowel movements and helps relieve constipation. In the case of oxaluria, it binds to oxalates, aiding in their excretion from the body.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Individuals on a low-sodium diet should use caution.
* **Interactions:** Magnesium citrate may interact with several medications, including tetracyclines, alfacalcidol, alpha-lipoic acid, calcium polystyrene sulfonate, levothyroxine, and multivitamins/fluoride supplements.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions if you're taking other medications.
* **Warnings:** Exercise caution in individuals with kidney impairment, heart failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or pre-existing electrolyte abnormalities. It should be used cautiously in individuals with myasthenia gravis or other neuromuscular diseases.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their physician before using magnesium citrate.  Children should generally avoid magnesium citrate.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies but is typically within 30 minutes to 6 hours.
* **Q: Can I take it every day?** A: No, magnesium citrate is not intended for daily use.  It should be used only occasionally to relieve constipation.  Chronic use can lead to electrolyte imbalances.
* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store magnesium citrate according to the instructions on the product label. Typically, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.
* **Q: Is it safe for pregnant women?** A:  Not recommended during pregnancy unless explicitly prescribed by a physician. Safer alternatives exist.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop use and contact your doctor immediately, particularly if side effects are severe or persistent.
