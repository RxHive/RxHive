# Mometasone + Azelastine
### Generic Name
Mometasone furoate + Azelastine hydrochloride


### Usage

Mometasone furoate + azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of seasonal and year-round allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  It's a combination medication containing two active ingredients:

* **Mometasone furoate:** A corticosteroid that reduces nasal inflammation. It works by suppressing the release of inflammatory substances in the nasal passages.  This helps to reduce swelling, congestion, and itching.

* **Azelastine hydrochloride:** An antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction. This helps relieve sneezing, runny nose, and itchy nose.

The combination of these two ingredients provides broader symptom relief than either medication alone.  While primarily used for allergic rhinitis,  a doctor might prescribe it off-label for other conditions involving nasal inflammation and allergic symptoms, but this should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific product formulation and the physician's prescription.  Always follow the directions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  Generally:

* **Adults and Children 12 years and older:** The usual dose is one spray in each nostril once daily.  Do not exceed the recommended dose.

There are no specific pediatric formulations available beyond the 12-year-old age limit.  For children younger than 12, other allergy medications may be more appropriate.  A doctor will determine the correct medication and dosage based on the child's age and condition.  

**Important Note:**  This medication is for nasal spray administration only.  Do not ingest or use it in any other way than directed.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Nasal irritation (burning, stinging, dryness)
* Nosebleeds
* Headache
* Bad taste in mouth
* Sneezing

Less common but more serious side effects are rare but should be reported immediately to your physician:

* Severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Increased risk of infections in the nose
* Vision changes


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

This combination medication works by targeting two key aspects of allergic rhinitis: inflammation and histamine release.

Mometasone furoate, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation in the nasal passages by suppressing the production of inflammatory substances like leukotrienes and prostaglandins. This lessens swelling, congestion, and itching.

Azelastine hydrochloride, an antihistamine, blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions that causes symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy nose and eyes.  By blocking histamine's action, azelastine helps to alleviate these symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used if you are allergic to either mometasone furoate, azelastine hydrochloride, or any other ingredients in the formulation.

* **Drug Interactions:** Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins.  Some medications may interact with mometasone furoate + azelastine hydrochloride.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.

* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary.

* **Children:** This medication is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  You may notice some relief within a few days, but full benefits may take several weeks.
