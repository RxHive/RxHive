# Mometasone + Azelastine

**Generic Name:** Mometasone furoate and azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray

**Usage:**

This combination nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies (allergic rhinitis) in adults and children 12 years of age and older.  These symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, and itchy, watery eyes.  It's important to note that it does *not* treat asthma or other respiratory conditions.  It should be used as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Common:** Nosebleeds, headache, throat irritation, burning or stinging sensation in the nose.
* **Less Common:**  Dryness in the nose, bad taste in the mouth, nasal dryness, coughing.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Although rare, allergic reactions (such as rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing) can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.  In rare cases, it can also affect the sense of smell (anosmia).

This list is not exhaustive, and the specific side effects and their severity can vary from person to person.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

This combination medication contains two active ingredients:

* **Mometasone furoate:** This is a corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.  It decreases the swelling and irritation that cause allergy symptoms.
* **Azelastine hydrochloride:** This is an antihistamine. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction that contributes to many allergy symptoms.

By combining these two mechanisms, the medication provides a more comprehensive approach to relieving allergy symptoms than either ingredient alone.
