# Moxidectin
### Generic Name
Moxidectin

### Usage
Moxidectin is primarily used to treat onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, caused by the parasitic worm *Onchocerca volvulus*.  It's specifically effective against the microfilariae (larval stage) of the parasite.  Importantly, moxidectin does *not* kill the adult worms.  Therefore, while it significantly reduces symptoms and the microfilarial load, it doesn't provide a complete cure.

### Dosage

**Onchocerciasis:**

* **Adults and Children ≥12 years:** The recommended dose is a single oral dose of 8 mg.  This is the only approved dosage regimen.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with liver impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/minute).  Dosage recommendations are not available for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/minute).
* **Children <12 years:** The safety and efficacy of moxidectin have not been established in children younger than 12 years old.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Chills
* Lymph node pain
* Pruritus (itching)
* Rash
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Orthostatic and non-orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Hyponatremia (low sodium levels)
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Gastroenteritis
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Lymphocytopenia (decreased lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell)
* Leukocytosis (increased white blood cells)
* Neutropenia (decreased neutrophils, a type of white blood cell)
* Musculoskeletal pain
* Flu-like symptoms
* Cough
* Fever


Less common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:


* Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension
* Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (liver enzyme)
* Hyperbilirubinemia (increased bilirubin levels)
* Increased ALT and AST levels (liver enzymes)
* Eosinopenia (decreased eosinophils)
* Eye pain
* Eye itching
* Visual impairment
* Allergic conjunctivitis
* Eyelid edema
* Increased lacrimation (tearing)
* Conjunctival and ocular hyperemia (redness)


A Mazzotti reaction (an inflammatory reaction) can also occur, although the exact frequency is not defined. This reaction involves various cutaneous, ophthalmologic, and systemic symptoms.


**Important Note:**  If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Moxidectin belongs to a class of drugs called macrocyclic lactones. It's a broad-spectrum endectocide, meaning it's effective against various internal and external parasites.  While its precise mechanism of action against *Onchocerca volvulus* isn't fully understood, it's believed to involve binding to glutamate-gated chloride channels, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, and/or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the parasite.  This interaction increases chloride ion permeability, leading to paralysis and ultimately the death of the microfilariae.  However, it is not effective against the adult worms.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Moxidectin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to moxidectin or any components of the formulation.
* **Loiasis Coinfection:**  Patients living in or traveling from areas where *Loa loa* (another parasitic worm) is prevalent should be screened for loiasis before treatment with moxidectin, as there's an increased risk of encephalopathy (brain swelling) with co-infection.
* **Mazzotti Reaction:** Be aware of the potential for a Mazzotti reaction, which can manifest as various cutaneous, ophthalmologic, and systemic symptoms.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of moxidectin during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Healthcare providers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits before prescribing it to pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Other Medications:**  While specific drug interactions are not extensively documented, it's always crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Though specific dosage adjustments aren't provided, healthcare providers should carefully monitor patients with liver or kidney disease.



### FAQs

**Q: How long does it take for moxidectin to work?**

A: The effects of moxidectin on microfilariae are typically seen within a few weeks, though the full clinical benefit might take longer.

**Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking moxidectin?**

A: There's no specific information about alcohol interaction with moxidectin. However, it's generally advisable to avoid alcohol while taking any medication unless explicitly advised otherwise by your healthcare provider.

**Q: How should I store moxidectin?**

A: Store moxidectin as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Once opened, use the medication within the time frame specified on the packaging.

**Q: Is moxidectin a cure for onchocerciasis?**

A: No, moxidectin primarily targets the microfilariae and doesn't kill the adult worms.  Therefore, it provides significant symptom relief and reduces the microfilarial load but doesn't offer a complete cure.  Further treatment may be necessary.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: Moxidectin is typically given as a single dose.  If you have questions or concerns about your treatment regimen, consult your healthcare provider.
