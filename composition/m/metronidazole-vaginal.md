# Metronidazole (Vaginal)
### Generic Name
Metronidazole (Vaginal)

### Usage
Metronidazole vaginal formulations are primarily used to treat two common vaginal infections in women: bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis.  Bacterial vaginosis is a condition caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina, leading to symptoms like unusual vaginal discharge, odor, and irritation. Trichomoniasis, on the other hand, is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a parasite, resulting in similar symptoms as BV, along with potential itching and burning.  Metronidazole effectively targets the microorganisms responsible for these infections.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated, the formulation of metronidazole used (gel, cream, or tablet), and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  The following information is for general guidance only and should not replace personalized medical advice.

**Bacterial Vaginosis:**

* **Gel (0.75%):** One applicatorful (approximately 37.5 mg metronidazole) intravaginally once daily (OD) or twice daily (BID) for 5 days.
* **Gel (1.3%):** One applicatorful (approximately 65 mg metronidazole) intravaginally as a single dose.

**Trichomoniasis:**

* **Cream (10%):** One applicatorful (equal to 500 mg metronidazole) intravaginally once daily (OD) or twice daily (BID) for 10 or 20 consecutive days.  This can be continued even during menstruation.
* **Vaginal Tablet (500 mg):** Insert one tablet at bedtime.  This is often used in combination with oral metronidazole (250 mg three times a day for 7 days or 250 mg twice a day for 10 days), as directed by a healthcare professional.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Use in children is generally limited to adolescents (age 12 and older)  with bacterial vaginosis.  The dosage is similar to adult dosages for BV, typically a single dose of 1.3% gel or a 5-day course of 0.75% gel, but always under the guidance of a pediatrician.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended for patients with kidney or liver impairment, but caution is advised in those with severe liver disease.  Always consult a doctor before using metronidazole if you have any pre-existing medical conditions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Vaginal discharge
* Fungal infections (yeast infections)
* Urinary tract infection (less common)

Less common but potentially more serious side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after using metronidazole, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Metronidazole is an antibiotic that works by interfering with the DNA of bacteria and parasites.  It enters the cells of these organisms and disrupts their ability to replicate and function properly, leading to their death. This process effectively eliminates the infectious agents causing bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Do not use metronidazole if you are allergic to metronidazole, other nitroimidazoles, or any ingredients in the formulation. Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment and for at least 72 hours afterward (especially with vaginal gel).  Do not use if you have recently taken disulfiram (Antabuse). Some formulations should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Consult your doctor about any underlying medical conditions.
* **Interactions:**  Metronidazole can interact with certain medications.  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Metronidazole is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy for treating symptomatic bacterial vaginosis, but caution is warranted in the first trimester.  It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding may need to be temporarily stopped during treatment and for 48 hours after completing therapy.  Always consult with your doctor.
* **Other Precautions:** Use caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, or a history of blood disorders or neurological conditions.


### FAQs

* **Q: How do I use metronidazole vaginally?** A: Follow the instructions provided by your doctor or the medication packaging. Generally, you fill an applicator with the medication, insert it high into the vagina, and press the plunger to release the medication. Clean the applicator thoroughly after each use.

* **Q: Can I use metronidazole if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  Consult your doctor. While generally considered safe for BV in pregnancy (after the first trimester), breastfeeding should be paused during treatment and for 48 hours afterwards.

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: How should I store metronidazole?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while using metronidazole?** A: No, avoid alcohol during treatment and for at least 72 hours afterwards (especially with vaginal gel). Alcohol can cause a serious reaction with metronidazole.
