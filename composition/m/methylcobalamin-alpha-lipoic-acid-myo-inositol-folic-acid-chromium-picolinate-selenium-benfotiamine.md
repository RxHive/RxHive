# Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Myo-Inositol + Folic Acid + Chromium Picolinate + Selenium + Benfotiamine

**Generic Name:**  Methylcobalamin + Alpha Lipoic Acid + Myo-Inositol + Folic Acid + Chromium Picolinate + Selenium + Benfotiamine (This is not a single, universally recognized generic name, as it's a combination product.  Each ingredient has its own generic name.)


**Usage:** This combination supplement is often marketed for supporting nerve health, improving glucose metabolism, and potentially addressing symptoms related to metabolic syndrome, neuropathy (nerve damage), and cognitive function.  Each ingredient plays a specific role:

* **Methylcobalamin:** A form of vitamin B12 crucial for nerve function and DNA synthesis.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA):** A potent antioxidant that can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce oxidative stress.
* **Myo-Inositol:** A type of sugar that plays a role in insulin signaling and may have benefits for PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and other metabolic conditions.
* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation.  Important for nerve health and preventing neural tube defects.
* **Chromium Picolinate:** May improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control.
* **Selenium:** An essential mineral and antioxidant that plays a role in various bodily functions.
* **Benfotiamine:** A fat-soluble form of thiamine (vitamin B1) that may be better absorbed than thiamine and may offer similar benefits regarding nerve function and glucose metabolism.

**Specific usage should always be determined by a healthcare professional.**  This combination is not a cure for any condition and should not replace medical treatment.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally rare at recommended dosages but can include:

* **Methylcobalamin:** Mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea) in some individuals.  High doses can cause skin flushing.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid:**  Rarely, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).  May lower blood sugar levels, so monitoring is crucial for diabetics.
* **Myo-Inositol:** Generally well-tolerated.  Gastrointestinal upset in some cases.
* **Folic Acid:** Generally well-tolerated, but high doses may mask a vitamin B12 deficiency.
* **Chromium Picolinate:**  Generally well-tolerated.  May cause gastrointestinal issues in high doses.  Some studies raise concerns about potential toxicity at very high levels.
* **Selenium:** High doses can lead to selenium toxicity (selenosis).  Symptoms include hair loss, nail changes, fatigue, and neurological effects.
* **Benfotiamine:**  Generally well-tolerated.  Mild gastrointestinal upset possible.


**How it Works:**  The ingredients work synergistically to support various metabolic processes.  Specifically:

*  Improved glucose metabolism through ALA, myo-inositol, chromium picolinate, and benfotiamine.
*  Reduced oxidative stress through ALA and selenium.
*  Enhanced nerve function via methylcobalamin, benfotiamine, and folic acid.
*  Support for overall cell health and DNA synthesis through folate, B12, and selenium.
