# Mycophenolate
### Generic Name
Mycophenolate

### Usage

Mycophenolate, available as mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid (the active metabolite), is a powerful immunosuppressant primarily used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation.  This means it helps the body accept the new organ and not attack it as a foreign body.  It's typically used in combination with other immunosuppressants like cyclosporine or tacrolimus, following kidney, heart, liver, or lung transplants.  

While its primary application is in organ transplantation, mycophenolate also sees off-label use in treating certain autoimmune diseases. These include autoimmune hepatitis, lupus nephritis, and, less frequently, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), and uveitis.  Off-label use means the drug isn't officially approved for these conditions, but its immunosuppressant properties may offer benefit in specific cases under careful medical supervision.  It's crucial to remember that off-label uses should only be considered under a doctor's guidance and monitoring.

### Dosage

Mycophenolate dosing is complex and highly individualized, varying greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, renal and hepatic function, and other medications they are taking.  There are two primary forms: mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and enteric-coated mycophenolic acid (EC-MPA).  These are *not* interchangeable; dosages must be calculated to account for their different bioavailability.  One should never switch between MMF and EC-MPA without direct consultation with a physician, as there are significant differences in how the body processes these two formulations.

**Organ Transplantation (Adult):** Dosage usually starts at 1g twice daily (BID) for MMF or 720mg BID for EC-MPA for kidney transplants. Heart and liver transplants may require higher initial doses (1.5g BID MMF or 1080mg BID EC-MPA), tailored to the specific immunosuppression regimen.  The maintenance dosage is adjusted based on response and potential side effects, often requiring close monitoring of blood counts.

**Autoimmune Diseases (Adult):** Doses for off-label uses in autoimmune conditions vary widely.  Typical MMF starting dosages might range from 500mg BID to 1g BID, often increasing gradually based on response and tolerance.  It's essential to note that this is not a complete list, and specific instructions are dependent on individual patient needs and the treating physician's recommendations.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosing is calculated based on body surface area (BSA) or weight and is significantly different from adult dosing.  This information should always be obtained from the prescribing physician or the official medication guide.  BSA-based dosing, in particular, is intricate and requires careful calculation. 

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments are often necessary for patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.  This is because the drug's metabolism and elimination are significantly affected by kidney and liver function.  Close monitoring and potential dosage reductions are necessary to minimize the risk of side effects in these patient groups.


### Side Effects

Mycophenolate can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others rare but potentially serious. It's important to note this list is not exhaustive.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Upper respiratory tract infection
*  Abdominal pain

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Anemia (low red blood cell count)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Increased risk of infections
* Hypertension
*  Increased risk of certain cancers (lymphoma)


If you experience any concerning side effects, immediately contact your doctor.  Early intervention is crucial in managing potential complications.

### How it Works

Mycophenolate works by selectively inhibiting an enzyme called inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). This enzyme is crucial for the production of DNA and RNA in lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell)  involved in the immune response.  By blocking IMPDH, mycophenolate suppresses the proliferation (growth and reproduction) of these cells, preventing the body from mounting an immune attack against the transplanted organ or against its own tissues in autoimmune diseases.  It primarily targets T and B lymphocytes.

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Mycophenolate is categorized as a pregnancy Category D drug, indicating a significant risk of birth defects and miscarriage.  Women of childbearing age must use highly effective contraception during treatment and for a considerable time afterward.  Breastfeeding while using mycophenolate is generally discouraged.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments are often necessary in patients with kidney or liver disease to prevent drug accumulation and potential toxicity.

* **Interactions with Other Drugs:** Mycophenolate can interact with numerous medications, potentially affecting its effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.

* **Infections:** Immunosuppression increases susceptibility to infections.  Report any signs of infection immediately.


* **Live Vaccines:** Avoid live vaccines during mycophenolate treatment as the immunosuppression may render them ineffective.

* **Allergies:**  Do not take mycophenolate if you have a known allergy to it or any of its components.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking mycophenolate?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit consumption significantly while on mycophenolate due to potential interactions and increased risk of side effects.  Always discuss alcohol intake with your physician.


* **Q: How should I store mycophenolate?** A: Store the medication as directed on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and heat.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's close to the next scheduled dose.  Never double up on doses.


* **Q: Can I stop taking mycophenolate suddenly?** A:  No, never stop taking mycophenolate or any immunosuppressant suddenly without consulting your doctor. Abrupt cessation can have serious consequences, especially in the context of organ transplant or autoimmune disease management.


* **Q:  Are there long-term risks associated with mycophenolate?** A: Long-term use of mycophenolate increases the risk of certain infections and malignancies.  Regular monitoring is essential to detect and manage these risks.  Your doctor will discuss these risks with you.
