# Milnacipran

**Generic Name:** Milnacipran

**Usage:**  Milnacipran is used to treat fibromyalgia and chronic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  It's a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), meaning it affects levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain and nervous system.  It's prescribed by doctors to manage pain and improve function in affected individuals.

**Side Effects:**  Like many medications, milnacipran can cause side effects.  The most common include:

* **Nausea:** This is frequently reported, especially at the start of treatment.
* **Headache:**  Headaches can be mild to moderate in severity.
* **Dizziness:**  Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Insomnia:** Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Sweating:** Increased perspiration.
* **Dry mouth:**  Decreased saliva production.
* **Increased blood pressure:** Though less common, this is a possibility.
* **Increased heart rate (tachycardia):** Also relatively uncommon.
* **Sexual dysfunction:** This can include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, or difficulty achieving orgasm.
* **Serious allergic reactions:** Though rare, seek immediate medical help if you experience symptoms like rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:** Milnacipran works by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain and nervous system. Serotonin and norepinephrine are neurotransmitters involved in pain perception, mood regulation, and other bodily functions. By increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters, milnacipran helps alleviate pain, improve mood, and potentially improve sleep in those with fibromyalgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
