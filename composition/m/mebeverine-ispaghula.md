# Mebeverine + Ispaghula

**Generic Name:** Mebeverine + Ispaghula husk

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), specifically those involving constipation and abdominal pain.  Mebeverine helps to relax the muscles in the gut, reducing spasms and pain. Ispaghula husk acts as a bulk-forming laxative, adding volume to the stool and promoting regular bowel movements.  It's crucial to consult a doctor before using this medication, as it may not be suitable for everyone with IBS.  The dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**

* **Mebeverine:**  Generally well-tolerated, but can cause occasional side effects such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness.  Rarely, allergic reactions may occur.
* **Ispaghula husk:** The most common side effects are bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort.  It can also cause constipation if not enough fluids are consumed. In rare cases, bowel obstruction is possible, especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions.  Allergic reactions are possible.
* **Combined Effects:**  The combined use may lead to an increased risk of the side effects listed above, though this isn't always the case.

**How it Works:**

* **Mebeverine:** Acts as an antispasmodic.  It works by selectively blocking the action of calcium channels in the smooth muscles of the intestinal tract. This reduces the intensity and frequency of bowel contractions, easing pain and discomfort associated with spasms. It primarily affects the gut, minimizing systemic side effects.
* **Ispaghula husk:**  A bulk-forming laxative.  It absorbs water in the intestines, increasing the bulk and softness of the stool, making it easier to pass.  This helps relieve constipation and promotes regular bowel movements.
