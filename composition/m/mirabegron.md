# Mirabegron
### Generic Name
Mirabegron

### Usage
Mirabegron is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is a condition characterized by urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence (accidental urine leakage due to a sudden, strong urge to urinate).  Mirabegron works by relaxing the bladder muscle, allowing it to hold more urine and reducing the frequency of urination and urgency.

In addition to its primary use in adults, Mirabegron is also approved for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in children aged 3 years and older weighing at least 35 kg. NDO is a condition where the bladder muscle contracts involuntarily, causing similar symptoms to OAB.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Overactive Bladder):**

* **Oral:** The usual starting dose is 25 mg once daily.  After 8 weeks, the doctor may increase the dose to 50 mg once daily based on the patient's response and tolerance.  If used with the medication solifenacin, the initial dose is 25 mg of Mirabegron and 5 mg of solifenacin, with the potential to increase the Mirabegron dose to 50mg after 4-8 weeks.


**Pediatric Dosage (Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity):**  Dosage depends on the child's weight and is administered orally as either extended-release tablets or granules.  **It's crucial to note that the tablet and granule formulations are not bioequivalent and cannot be substituted.**

* **Children aged ≥3 years and adolescents, weighing 11 to <22 kg:** Initial dose is 24 mg once daily. This can be increased to a maximum of 48 mg once daily after 4-8 weeks if needed. Granules are used for this weight range.
* **Children aged ≥3 years and adolescents, weighing 22 to <35 kg:** Initial dose is 32 mg once daily. This can be increased to a maximum of 64 mg once daily after 4-8 weeks if needed. Granules are used for this weight range.
* **Children aged ≥3 years and adolescents, weighing ≥35 kg:**  The initial dose can be either 25 mg (tablet) or 48 mg (granule) once daily. This can be increased to a maximum of 50 mg (tablet) or 80 mg (granule) once daily after 4-8 weeks if needed.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary for individuals with liver problems.  Those with mild impairment may not need adjustments, moderate impairment requires a maximum dose of 25mg once daily, and severe impairment generally prohibits use.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are also needed for those with kidney problems.  Individuals with mild to moderate impairment may not require adjustments but should not exceed 25mg once daily; it's not recommended for those with severe impairment or who are on hemodialysis.

**If you experience any adverse effects, it is crucial to contact your healthcare provider.**


### How it Works
Mirabegron is a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist.  It works by selectively activating beta-3 receptors in the bladder.  This activation leads to relaxation of the detrusor muscle (the muscle responsible for bladder contractions).  By relaxing this muscle, the bladder can hold more urine before the urge to urinate is felt, thus reducing the frequency and urgency of urination.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mirabegron should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to it, severe uncontrolled hypertension, or (according to Canadian labeling) pregnancy.
* **Interactions:** Mirabegron can interact with several other medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of side effects.  Discuss all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies) with your doctor before starting Mirabegron.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with bladder outlet obstruction, those taking other medications that affect bladder function (e.g., other anticholinergics), mild to moderate hepatic impairment, those with a history of QT interval prolongation, and renal impairment.  Regular blood pressure monitoring is recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of Mirabegron during pregnancy is generally not recommended. Its effects on breastfeeding are unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Mirabegron?** A: There's no specific contraindication regarding alcohol consumption, but it's always best to consult your doctor.  Alcohol can sometimes affect blood pressure, which is already a potential concern with Mirabegron.

* **Q: How should I store Mirabegron?** A: Store Mirabegron as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it has been more than 12 hours since the missed dose; in that case, skip it and take the next dose at the usual time.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  It generally takes around 8 weeks for Mirabegron to show its full effect.

* **Q: Can Mirabegron cause weight gain?** A: While not a commonly reported side effect, weight changes can occur with any medication, and this should be discussed with your doctor if observed.
