# Mifamurtide
### Generic Name
Mifamurtide

### Usage
Mifamurtide is used as an adjunct therapy in treating high-grade, resectable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma in children, adolescents, and young adults.  This means it's used *in addition* to surgery, not as a replacement.  It's specifically employed following the complete surgical removal of the tumor.  The drug is not a primary treatment for osteosarcoma but plays a crucial role in improving outcomes when used after surgery.  Currently, there are no approved uses of Mifamurtide outside of this specific context.

### Dosage

**Osteosarcoma (Children ≥2 years, Adolescents, and Young Adults ≤30 years):**

Mifamurtide is administered intravenously (IV).  The dosage is calculated based on body surface area (BSA).

* **Phase 1:** 2 mg/m² BSA twice weekly, with at least 3 days between each dose, for a total of 12 weeks.
* **Phase 2:** 2 mg/m² BSA once weekly for 24 weeks.

This results in a total of 48 infusions given over 36 weeks.  The exact dosage calculation requires precise BSA measurement, which should be performed by a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** For mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), no dosage adjustment is typically needed, though caution is advised.  No specific dosage adjustment is provided for severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min, no adjustment is usually necessary.  For CrCl < 30 mL/min, no specific dosage adjustment is provided in the manufacturer's labeling; careful monitoring is crucial.

**Important Note:** The safety and efficacy of Mifamurtide haven't been established in children under 2 years old.

### How it Works

Mifamurtide is a liposomal immunostimulant. It activates immune cells called monocytes and macrophages, boosting their production of cytokines (signaling molecules that regulate immune responses) such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12), and adhesion molecules (LFA-1 and ICAM-1).  These actions enhance the immune system's ability to target and fight the cancer cells.  The exact mechanism by which this improves osteosarcoma outcomes is still under investigation, but it's believed to involve a multifaceted immune response against the tumor.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Mifamurtide or any of its components.
* Concomitant use with cyclosporine or other calcineurin inhibitors.
* Concurrent use with high-dose NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase inhibitors.


**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Mifamurtide is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its risks to the fetus are unknown. It should be avoided in pregnant women or those who are not using effective contraception.  Breastfeeding considerations should be discussed with a physician.
* Patients with a history of autoimmune, inflammatory, or collagen diseases should be closely monitored.  The same applies to patients with a history of venous thromboembolism, vasculitis, or unstable cardiovascular disorders, asthma, or COPD, or those with impaired renal or hepatic function.  
* Mifamurtide can cause drowsiness and dizziness; patients should avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
* Close monitoring of blood counts (CBC), renal and hepatic function, gastrointestinal symptoms, and respiratory function is necessary during treatment.
