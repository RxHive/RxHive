# Montelukast
### Generic Name
Montelukast

### Usage

Montelukast is primarily used to prevent and treat asthma in adults and children aged 12 months and older.  It's also effective in preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients 6 years and older.  Furthermore, it's used to relieve symptoms of both seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  While not officially FDA-approved for this use, it's sometimes used off-label to treat chronic urticaria (hives).


### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Allergic Rhinitis (Seasonal or Perennial):** 10 mg orally once daily.  The FDA recommends considering Montelukast for allergic rhinitis only if other therapies have proven inadequate or are poorly tolerated.
* **Asthma:** 10 mg orally once daily in the evening.
* **Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) Prevention:** 10 mg orally at least 2 hours before exercise.  Do not take another dose within 24 hours. Patients already on Montelukast for other conditions shouldn't take an additional dose for EIB prevention.
* **Chronic Urticaria (Off-label):** 10 mg orally once daily.


**Children:** The dosage varies depending on age and the condition being treated:

* **Allergic Rhinitis (Perennial):**
    * 6 months to <6 years: 4 mg once daily.
    * 6 years to <15 years: 5 mg once daily.
    * ≥15 years: 10 mg once daily.
* **Allergic Rhinitis (Seasonal):**
    * 2-5 years: 4 mg once daily.
    * 6 years to <15 years: 5 mg once daily.
    * ≥15 years: 10 mg once daily.
* **Asthma (Maintenance):**
    * 1-5 years: 4 mg once daily in the evening.
    * 6-14 years: 5 mg once daily in the evening.
    * ≥15 years: 10 mg once daily in the evening.  Note that inhaled corticosteroids are generally preferred for asthma management.
* **Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) Prevention:**
    * 6 years to <15 years: 5 mg at least 2 hours before exercise.
    * ≥15 years: 10 mg at least 2 hours before exercise.  Do not take another dose within 24 hours. Patients already on daily Montelukast shouldn't take an additional dose for EIB.  Always have a rescue inhaler (short-acting beta-agonist) readily available.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific adjustments for severe hepatic impairment or renal impairment.

### How it Works

Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA). Leukotrienes are substances in the body that trigger inflammation and constriction of the airways.  Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, reducing inflammation and improving airflow in the lungs, thus relieving asthma symptoms.  It also reduces inflammation in the nasal passages, alleviating allergic rhinitis symptoms.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Montelukast is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Montelukast or any of its components.
* **Interactions:**  Montelukast's effects might be decreased by lumacaftor and increased by gemfibrozil.  Montelukast might increase the effects of loxapine.  Discuss all medications with your doctor before starting Montelukast.
* **Warnings:**  There is a boxed warning about the potential for serious neuropsychiatric events, including suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Monitor for changes in mood or behavior.  Discontinue use and contact a healthcare provider immediately if such symptoms occur.  Patients with asthma should be closely monitored when reducing corticosteroid doses while starting or continuing Montelukast.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Montelukast is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning animal studies have shown no risk, but human studies are lacking.  It's excreted in breast milk.  Weigh the risks and benefits with your doctor.  Generally, breastfeeding is encouraged for asthmatic mothers.
* **Children:** Exercise caution when administering to young children, following prescribed dosage carefully.
* **Aspirin Sensitivity:** Patients with aspirin sensitivity should continue to avoid aspirin and NSAIDs while taking Montelukast.
