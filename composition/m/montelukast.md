# Montelukast

**Generic Name:** Montelukast

**Usage:**  Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier used to prevent and treat asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm. It's also used to prevent and treat the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  It does *not* treat acute asthma attacks; it's for long-term control.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Common:** Headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, rash, fever.
* **Less Common:**  Muscle aches, insomnia, nervousness, fatigue, increased liver enzymes (seen in blood tests), abnormal dreams.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Cholestatic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction), suicidal thoughts (although a causal link is debated and more research is needed), allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list and individuals may experience other side effects.  Consult a doctor if you experience any concerning symptoms.


**How it Works:** Montelukast works by blocking the action of leukotrienes, which are chemicals produced by the body that cause inflammation and tightening of the airways. By blocking these leukotrienes, montelukast helps to reduce inflammation and improve airflow in the lungs, easing asthma symptoms and preventing allergic reactions.
