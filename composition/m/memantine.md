# Memantine
### Generic Name
Memantine

### Usage
Memantine is primarily used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease dementia.  It's an NMDA receptor antagonist, meaning it works by blocking the action of a specific type of receptor in the brain involved in learning and memory. By doing so, it helps to improve cognitive function and reduce some of the symptoms associated with Alzheimer's.  While not officially approved for this use, memantine is sometimes used off-label in the treatment of mild to moderate vascular dementia,  another type of dementia caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.  However, its efficacy in vascular dementia is less established than in Alzheimer's disease.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies depending on the formulation (immediate-release or extended-release) and the patient's condition.  It's crucial to follow the doctor's instructions precisely.

* **Immediate-Release:**  Treatment typically begins with a low dose (5 mg once daily) and is gradually increased over several weeks to a target dose of 20 mg daily, divided into two doses (10 mg twice daily). The increase should be done in increments of 5 mg at intervals of at least one week.

* **Extended-Release:**  Treatment starts with 7 mg once daily, gradually increasing at intervals of at least one week to a maximum dose of 28 mg once daily.  The increase should be done in increments of 7 mg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on kidney function. Individuals with severe kidney impairment require a lower starting dose and potentially slower titration to the target dose.  Those with mild to moderate kidney or liver impairment typically don't require dose adjustments. Always consult a doctor for guidance on dosage adjustments.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of memantine in children haven't been established. It's not recommended for use in children.

**Important Note:** Switching between immediate-release and extended-release formulations should be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  There are specific instructions to follow to ensure a smooth transition.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Confusion
* High blood pressure
* Low blood pressure
* Drowsiness


**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
* Seizures
* Hallucinations
* Suicidal thoughts
* Liver problems
* Kidney problems
* Changes in heart rhythm (prolonged QT interval)

If any of these side effects occur, or if you experience any other unusual symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Memantine works by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain.  These receptors are involved in regulating the neurotransmitter glutamate, which plays a crucial role in learning and memory.  In Alzheimer's disease, there's an overabundance of glutamate, leading to neuronal damage. Memantine selectively blocks the NMDA receptors, preventing excessive glutamate activity and thus protecting brain cells. This helps to improve cognitive function and reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Memantine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to memantine or any components of the medication.

* **Drug Interactions:** Memantine can interact with numerous other medications, potentially increasing or decreasing their effects. This includes medications such as amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan, barbiturates, neuroleptics, L-dopa, dopaminergic agonists, anticholinergics, antispasmodics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, cimetidine, procainamide, ranitidine, quinidine, quinine, nicotine and hydrochlorothiazide. It's vital to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking before starting memantine.

* **Warnings:**  Use caution in patients with severe liver or kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, a history of seizures, or ophthalmic conditions.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding:  Memantine is a Pregnancy Category B drug, but its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered.  Consult with a doctor to weigh the risks and benefits.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take memantine with other medications?**  A: It's crucial to discuss all your medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, with your doctor before starting memantine.  Interactions can occur and may necessitate dosage adjustments or alternative treatment options.

* **Q: How long does it take for memantine to work?** A:  The effects of memantine may not be immediately noticeable.  It may take several weeks for full therapeutic benefit to be observed.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.  If you miss several doses, consult your doctor on how to resume treatment safely.

* **Q: How should I store memantine?** A: Store memantine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking memantine suddenly?** A:  No.  Sudden discontinuation can lead to a worsening of symptoms.  The medication should be gradually tapered under the guidance of your doctor.

* **Q:  Is memantine addictive?** A:  Memantine is not considered an addictive medication.
