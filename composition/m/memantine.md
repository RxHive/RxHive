# Memantine

**Generic Name:** Memantine

**Usage:**

Memantine is used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.  It's specifically aimed at improving cognitive function (thinking, memory, and reasoning) and the ability to perform daily tasks in individuals with this condition.  It's not a cure for Alzheimer's, but it can help slow the progression of symptoms and improve quality of life.  It is *not* used to treat other types of dementia.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Headache:** This is one of the most frequently reported side effects.
* **Dizziness:**  Can lead to falls, especially in older adults.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty with bowel movements.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to the stomach.
* **Confusion:**  May worsen existing cognitive problems.
* **Drowsiness:** Feeling sleepy or fatigued.
* **Vertigo:** A sensation of spinning or movement.
* **High blood pressure:** Although less common, it's important to monitor blood pressure.

Less common, but more serious side effects include:

* **Hallucinations:** Seeing or hearing things that aren't there.
* **Agitation:** Increased restlessness or irritability.
* **Depression:** Feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These are rare but can be life-threatening.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms like swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, or hives.


**How it Works:**

Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist.  In Alzheimer's disease, there's an over-activation of NMDA receptors in the brain, leading to neuronal damage. Memantine works by blocking the excessive activity of these receptors, thereby protecting brain cells from further damage and potentially improving cognitive function. It's thought to work differently than cholinesterase inhibitors (another class of Alzheimer's medication), offering a complementary mechanism of action.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: How long does it take to work?**  A:  The effects of memantine are usually not seen immediately. It may take several weeks to notice any significant improvement in symptoms.
* **Q: Can I take it with other medications?** A:  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.  Interactions with other drugs are possible.
* **Q: What are the risks of stopping suddenly?** A:  Stopping memantine abruptly can lead to worsening of symptoms or withdrawal effects.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and discontinuation.
* **Q: Is it right for everyone with Alzheimer's?** A: No.  Memantine is generally prescribed for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.  Your doctor will determine if it's appropriate for your specific situation.
* **Q: Are there any precautions I should take?** A:  People with kidney problems, heart conditions, or a history of seizures should discuss these with their doctor before taking memantine.  Regular monitoring of kidney function might be necessary.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not take two doses at once.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions.
