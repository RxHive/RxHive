# Mepolizumab
### Generic Name
Mepolizumab

### Usage
Mepolizumab is a medication used as an add-on maintenance treatment for several conditions. Its primary use is in managing severe asthma, specifically in patients with an eosinophilic phenotype (meaning their asthma is linked to high levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell).  It's also approved for treating eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), a rare disorder affecting the blood vessels, and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), a condition characterized by an abnormally high number of eosinophils in the blood.  Importantly, mepolizumab is *not* intended for immediate relief of asthma symptoms like acute bronchospasm or a severe asthma attack (status asthmaticus).

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age:

**Severe Eosinophilic Asthma (Maintenance):**

* **Adults:** 100 mg subcutaneously (under the skin) every 4 weeks.
* **Children (6-11 years):** 40 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.
* **Children (12 years and older):** 100 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.


**Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) and Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES):**

* **Adults and children (12 years and older):** 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.  For the 300mg dose, this may be administered as three separate 100mg injections.

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment haven't been specifically studied and aren't routinely recommended by the manufacturer, as mepolizumab's elimination isn't primarily through these organs.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Headache
* Injection site reactions


**Less Common Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Eczema and itching (pruritus)
* Upper abdominal pain
* Urinary tract infection
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions), including angioedema (swelling)
* Development of antibodies against the drug
* Influenza (flu)
* Back pain and muscle spasms


**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Type IV hypersensitivity reactions (delayed allergic reactions)
* Herpes zoster infection (shingles)


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5 (IL-5).  IL-5 is a protein that plays a key role in the growth and activation of eosinophils. By binding to IL-5, mepolizumab prevents IL-5 from stimulating eosinophils, thereby reducing their numbers in the blood, tissues, and airways. This reduction in eosinophils helps to alleviate the inflammation and symptoms associated with asthma, EGPA, and HES.


### Precautions

* **Contraindicated in:** Patients with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to mepolizumab or any of its components.
* **Increased Risk:**  Patients may have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and opportunistic infections, such as herpes zoster (shingles). Vaccination against shingles may be considered before starting mepolizumab.
* **Pre-existing Infections:** Patients with pre-existing helminth (worm) infections should treat these infections before beginning mepolizumab. Treatment should be stopped if new infections develop and don't respond to treatment.
* **Corticosteroids:**  Do not stop taking systemic or inhaled corticosteroids suddenly when starting mepolizumab.  Dosage reductions should be gradual and only as directed by your healthcare provider.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and discussed with your doctor; other treatment options may be preferred.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is mepolizumab administered?**  A: Mepolizumab is given as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  It may be self-administered after proper training.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The full therapeutic effect may not be seen immediately.  Improvement in symptoms typically occurs over several weeks or months of treatment.
* **Q: Can I stop taking mepolizumab suddenly?** A:  No, discontinuation should be gradual, following your healthcare provider's instructions.
* **Q: How should I store mepolizumab?** A:  Storage instructions will be on the medication packaging; generally, it should be refrigerated.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.  Do not try to catch up by taking two doses at once.
* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A:  While specific interactions are rare, it's important to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.
