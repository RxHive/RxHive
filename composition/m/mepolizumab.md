# Mepolizumab

**Generic Name:** Mepolizumab

**Usage:**  Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat specific types of eosinophilic diseases.  Its primary uses are:

* **Severe eosinophilic asthma:**  For adults and adolescents with severe eosinophilic asthma who are inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medication (like a long-acting beta-agonist).  Specifically, it targets patients with a high blood eosinophil count and/or an elevated fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO).
* **Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA):** Also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, mepolizumab is used to treat adults with this rare disease.
* **Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES):**  Mepolizumab is used for the treatment of adults with HES.


**Side Effects:** Common side effects of mepolizumab include:

* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Back pain
* Muscle pain


More serious, though less common, side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis â€“ a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction)
* Worsening of asthma symptoms (paradoxical bronchospasm)


It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and individual experiences may vary.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for a complete list of potential side effects.


**How it Works:** Mepolizumab is a targeted biologic therapy. It's a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits interleukin-5 (IL-5).  IL-5 is a cytokine (a signaling protein) that plays a crucial role in the growth, activation, and survival of eosinophils.  By blocking IL-5, mepolizumab reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and airways, thereby lessening inflammation and improving symptoms in eosinophilic diseases.


**FAQs:**

* **How is mepolizumab administered?** It's administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin), usually by a healthcare professional.
* **How often is mepolizumab given?**  The dosage and frequency of administration vary depending on the specific disease being treated and the patient's response.  It's typically given every 4 weeks.
* **Is mepolizumab a cure?** No, mepolizumab is not a cure for eosinophilic diseases. It is a maintenance therapy aimed at controlling symptoms and reducing inflammation.
* **Who shouldn't take mepolizumab?** Individuals with known hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or any of its components should not take it.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using it.
