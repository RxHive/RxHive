# Metronidazole + Diloxanide

**Generic Name:** Metronidazole + Diloxanide furoate

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to treat amoebiasis, a parasitic infection of the intestines caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*.  It's specifically effective against both intestinal and extra-intestinal (e.g., liver abscess) forms of the disease.  It's usually prescribed for a specific duration as determined by a physician.  The medication may be prescribed alone or in combination with other treatments depending on the severity and type of infection.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, metallic taste in the mouth, anorexia.
* **Neurological effects:** Headache, dizziness, vertigo, seizures (rare).
* **Hematological effects:**  Changes in blood counts (rare).
* **Allergic reactions:** Skin rashes, itching, hives, swelling (angioedema - rare but serious).
* **Darkening of urine:** This is a harmless effect of metronidazole metabolism.


**How it Works:**

* **Metronidazole:** This is a nitroimidazole antibiotic that works by disrupting the DNA of the amoeba, leading to its death. It's effective against the trophozoite (active, growing stage) of *Entamoeba histolytica* in the intestines and liver.

* **Diloxanide furoate:** This is an amoebicide that primarily targets the cyst form of *Entamoeba histolytica* in the intestines.  Cysts are the dormant, infectious stage of the parasite, and eliminating them helps prevent reinfection and transmission.  It does not penetrate tissues beyond the intestinal lumen as effectively as metronidazole.

The combination of both drugs ensures broader coverage against both the active and dormant forms of the parasite, increasing the effectiveness of treatment and reducing the chances of relapse.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** No.  Metronidazole interacts strongly with alcohol, causing a disulfiram-like reaction (severe nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing). Avoid alcohol completely during treatment and for at least 24-48 hours after finishing the medication.

* **How long does treatment typically last?** The duration of treatment is determined by a physician based on the severity of the infection and individual patient factors. It typically lasts for several days to a couple of weeks.  Strict adherence to the prescribed regimen is crucial for effective treatment.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Are there any drug interactions?** Yes, inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions may occur.  Especially important are interactions with anticoagulants and certain other medications.

* **What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe side effects such as seizures, severe allergic reactions, or significant changes in your health.
