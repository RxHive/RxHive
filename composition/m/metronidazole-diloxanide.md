# Metronidazole + Diloxanide
### Generic Name
Metronidazole + Diloxanide

### Usage
Metronidazole and Diloxanide is a combination medication used to treat intestinal infections caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*, the parasite responsible for amoebiasis.  This combination therapy targets different stages of the amoeba's life cycle. Metronidazole primarily acts against the trophozoites (active, feeding forms) of the parasite, while diloxanide furoate targets the cysts (dormant, infective forms). This dual action increases the effectiveness of treatment and helps prevent recurrence of the infection.  While primarily used for amoebiasis affecting the intestines (intestinal amoebiasis),  it's crucial to remember this combination is *not* effective against amoebic liver abscesses or other extra-intestinal forms of the disease.  Those require different treatment approaches.

### Dosage
Dosage should always be determined and supervised by a healthcare professional.  The specific dosage will depend on the patient's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  There is no standard pediatric dosage readily available in combined form.  Typically, the combination isn't prescribed for children; instead, dosages of Metronidazole and Diloxanide furoate are individually determined by the prescribing physician.

**Adult Dosage (Typical, but always consult a doctor):**  The usual adult dosage involves taking both Metronidazole and Diloxanide furoate tablets according to the physician's instructions. This often involves taking the Metronidazole for a specific duration and Diloxanide furoate for a shorter duration afterwards. The exact regimen will vary based on the severity of infection and the doctorâ€™s assessment.


**No standard IV formulation exists for this combination.** Both Metronidazole and Diloxanide furoate are generally administered orally.

**Important Note:**  This information is for general understanding and does not replace medical advice.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage and instructions carefully.

### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, metallic taste in the mouth, headache, dizziness.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), seizures, peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling in extremities), dark urine, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), changes in blood cell counts.

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic.  It works by entering the amoeba cells and interfering with their DNA, leading to cell death. Diloxanide furoate is an aminohydroxyquinoline derivative. It's thought to work by interfering with the amoeba's energy production and protein synthesis, thereby inhibiting its growth and reproduction, especially targeting the cyst forms crucial for transmission.  The combined effect of these two drugs provides a more comprehensive approach to treating amoebiasis by targeting both the active and dormant stages of the parasite.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Metronidazole should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to nitroimidazoles or diloxanide furoate.
* **Drug Interactions:** Metronidazole can interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), lithium, and disulfiram (Antabuse). Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of Metronidazole and Diloxanide furoate during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully evaluated by a doctor, weighing the benefits against potential risks.  Consult your doctor.
* **Alcohol Consumption:** Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment with Metronidazole, as this can lead to a disulfiram-like reaction (severe nausea, vomiting, headache).
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:**  Patients with liver or kidney disease may require dosage adjustments.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  Improvement in symptoms should be noticeable within a few days, but the full course of treatment must be completed to ensure eradication of the parasite.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other medicines?** A:  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A:  Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is this medication safe for children?** A:  The combined formulation is not typically prescribed for children.  Consult your doctor for appropriate treatment for children.
