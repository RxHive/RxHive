# Metacycline
### Generic Name
Metacycline (Methacycline)

### Usage
Metacycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in treating susceptible infections caused by bacteria, including but not limited to:

* **Brucellosis:** A bacterial infection transmitted from animals to humans.
* **Cholera:** A severe diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with *Vibrio cholerae* bacteria.
* **Cat scratch disease:**  A bacterial infection spread by the scratch or bite of a cat.
* **Typhus (including murine typhus and Mediterranean spotted fever):** A group of potentially life-threatening bacterial infections spread by lice, fleas, or mites.
* **Borreliosis (Lyme disease):** A bacterial infection transmitted by ticks.
* **Chlamydial infections:** Sexually transmitted infections and other infections caused by *Chlamydia* bacteria.
* **Gonorrhea:** A sexually transmitted infection caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* bacteria.

While effective against a range of bacteria, it's crucial to remember that antibiotic resistance is a growing concern.  The use of Metacycline should be guided by culture and sensitivity testing to ensure it is the appropriate treatment for the specific infection.


### Dosage

**Adults:** For most susceptible infections, the usual oral dose is 600 mg daily, typically divided into 150 mg four times a day (QID) or 300 mg twice a day (BID).  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will depend on the severity and type of infection, as determined by a healthcare professional.

**Children (8 years and older):**  Metacycline should generally be avoided in children younger than 8 years due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia (imperfect formation of tooth enamel). If absolutely necessary in older children (8 years and older), the usual oral dose is 6-12 mg/kg/day, divided into 2-4 doses.  Again, a healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage and duration.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage reduction may be necessary for individuals with kidney impairment.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for liver impairment; however, caution is advised.  Always consult a doctor before adjusting the dosage.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Headache
* Skin photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight)
* Skin rash, dermatitis, itching (pruritus), and hives (urticaria)
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric pain (pain in the upper abdomen), anorexia (loss of appetite), esophageal ulcers, glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), oral candidiasis (thrush), and tooth and nail discoloration
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Fatty liver
* Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)


Less common, but serious side effects can include:

* Intracranial hypertension (increased pressure within the skull)
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Neuromuscular blockade (muscle weakness or paralysis)
* Renal dysfunction (kidney problems)
* Enamel hypoplasia (imperfect tooth enamel formation)

If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Metacycline is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it inhibits the growth of bacteria rather than directly killing them.  It achieves this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, a crucial component of bacterial protein synthesis machinery.  By interfering with this process, Metacycline prevents bacteria from producing essential proteins, ultimately inhibiting their growth and allowing the body's immune system to clear the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Metacycline is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and children under 8 years of age (due to the risk of tooth discoloration).
* **Drug Interactions:** Metacycline can interact with numerous medications, including antacids, calcium salts, iron salts, magnesium salts, multivitamins/minerals, neuromuscular-blocking agents, penicillins, retinoic acid derivatives, sodium picosulfate, typhoid vaccine, vitamin K antagonists, and zinc salts.  These interactions can either reduce the effectiveness of Metacycline or increase the risk of side effects.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  Patients should be advised to avoid direct sunlight exposure due to the risk of photosensitivity.  Taking Metacycline with milk or dairy products may reduce its absorption.  Individuals with liver or kidney impairment should use Metacycline with caution, and a doctor should monitor their condition closely.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Metacycline with milk or dairy products?** A: No, it's best to avoid taking Metacycline with dairy products as they can interfere with its absorption.
* **Q: How should I store Metacycline?** A: Store Metacycline at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I take Metacycline if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** A: No, Metacycline is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  Is Metacycline safe for children?** A: Generally, Metacycline should be avoided in children under 8 years old due to the risk of tooth discoloration.  Use in older children should only be under strict medical supervision.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking Metacycline once I feel better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the entire course of treatment prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to the return of the infection and the development of antibiotic resistance.
