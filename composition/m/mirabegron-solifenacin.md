# Mirabegron + Solifenacin

There is no FDA-approved combination drug containing both mirabegron and solifenacin.  These are two separate medications used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  They work through different mechanisms.  Therefore, a combined generic "Mirabegron + Solifenacin" doesn't exist.  Providing details in the requested format for a non-existent drug would be misleading.

However, I can provide information on each drug individually:

**Mirabegron (Generic Name):**

* **Generic Name:** Mirabegron
* **Usage:** Treats overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.
* **Side Effects:**  Common side effects include increased blood pressure, headache, nausea, and dizziness.  Less common but more serious side effects can include fast heartbeat and allergic reactions.
* **How it Works:** Mirabegron is a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist.  It relaxes the bladder muscle, allowing for increased bladder capacity and reduced urgency.
* **FAQs:**
    * **Is Mirabegron a controlled substance?** No.
    * **Can I drink alcohol while taking Mirabegron?**  While not explicitly contraindicated, alcohol can worsen some side effects like dizziness.  Moderate consumption is generally advised.
    * **How long does it take to work?**  It may take several weeks to see the full benefit.


**Solifenacin (Generic Name):**

* **Generic Name:** Solifenacin
* **Usage:** Treats overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.
* **Side Effects:** Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and dizziness. Less common but more serious side effects can include urinary retention and glaucoma.
* **How it Works:** Solifenacin is an antimuscarinic drug. It blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes bladder contractions.  This helps to relax the bladder and reduce the frequency of urination.
* **FAQs:**
    * **Is Solifenacin a controlled substance?** No.
    * **Can I take Solifenacin with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.
    * **How long does it take to work?** It may take several weeks to see the full benefit.
