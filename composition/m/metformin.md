# Metformin
### Generic Name
Metformin

### Usage

Metformin is primarily used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It's used as an adjunct to diet and exercise, meaning it works best when combined with lifestyle changes.  While not its primary indication, Metformin has also seen off-label use in several conditions, including:

* **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):**  Historically used to improve menstrual regularity and ovulation in women with PCOS, however, current guidelines often prioritize other treatment options.
* **Gestational diabetes:**  May be used as an alternative treatment option in some pregnant women with gestational diabetes, although other agents are generally preferred.
* **Prevention of type 2 diabetes:** In individuals at high risk, Metformin may be used to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
* **Antipsychotic-induced weight gain:**  It's sometimes used off-label to help manage weight gain associated with certain antipsychotic medications.

It's crucial to understand that these off-label uses aren't as extensively studied as its primary use in type 2 diabetes and should only be considered under the strict guidance of a healthcare professional.


### Dosage

Metformin dosage varies significantly depending on the individual, their condition, and the specific formulation of the medication (immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, or solution).  Always follow your doctor's instructions precisely.

**Adults:**  Dosage for type 2 diabetes typically starts low and is gradually increased based on response and tolerability.  Immediate-release formulations might begin at 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once daily, increasing incrementally.  Extended-release formulations may start at 500 mg once daily, with similar titration. Maximum doses vary depending on the formulation and individual response.  Consult a doctor for specific guidance.  Detailed dosing instructions for off-label uses are similarly complex and require professional medical supervision.

**Children:**  Metformin use in children (generally 10 years and older) is often tailored to the individual's needs and is strictly monitored by a healthcare professional.  Dosage typically starts lower than in adults and is increased gradually, as tolerated.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Kidney function (eGFR) significantly impacts Metformin dosage.  In individuals with reduced kidney function, the dose may need to be lowered or the medication discontinued altogether.  Liver impairment also necessitates careful consideration and may contraindicate Metformin use.

### Side Effects

Common side effects often resolve with time or dose adjustment and usually include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Flatulence
* Metallic taste

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Lactic acidosis (a rare but potentially fatal build-up of lactic acid in the blood)
* Vitamin B12 deficiency
* Liver problems

**If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

Metformin works in several ways to lower blood sugar:

* **Decreases hepatic glucose production:** It reduces the amount of glucose produced by the liver.
* **Reduces intestinal glucose absorption:** It lessens the absorption of glucose from the digestive tract.
* **Increases insulin sensitivity:**  It makes the body's cells more responsive to insulin, improving glucose uptake and utilization.

Unlike some other diabetes medications, Metformin does not stimulate insulin release from the pancreas.

### Precautions

* **Kidney disease:** Metformin is contraindicated in individuals with severe kidney disease.  Kidney function should be monitored regularly during Metformin treatment.
* **Liver disease:**  Metformin should be used cautiously or avoided altogether in individuals with liver disease.
* **Alcohol use:**  Excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of lactic acidosis.
* **Iodinated contrast media:** Metformin should usually be temporarily stopped before and after medical imaging procedures involving iodinated contrast dye due to increased risk of lactic acidosis.
* **Surgery:**  Metformin may need to be temporarily discontinued before and after major surgery.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** While Metformin is generally considered a category B drug in pregnancy (meaning studies in animals have not shown harm, but human studies are lacking),  other diabetes medications are usually preferred during pregnancy.  Metformin is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding mothers should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor.


### FAQs

* **Can I take Metformin with other medications?**  Metformin can interact with certain medications, including some diuretics, corticosteroids, and certain contrast dyes.  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **How should I store Metformin?**  Store Metformin as directed on the label, typically at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double up on doses.

* **Is Metformin safe for long-term use?**  Metformin is generally considered safe for long-term use when monitored appropriately by a healthcare professional.  Regular monitoring of kidney function is essential.

* **Can Metformin cause weight gain?** Metformin generally does not cause weight gain; it may even help with weight loss in some individuals.
