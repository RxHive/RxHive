# Metformin

**Generic Name:** Metformin

**Usage:**

Metformin is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes.  It helps control blood sugar levels by:

* **Decreasing the amount of glucose your liver produces:**  Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production, meaning it lessens the amount of sugar your liver releases into your bloodstream.
* **Improving your body's sensitivity to insulin:** Insulin helps glucose move from your blood into your cells for energy. Metformin enhances your body's response to insulin, allowing glucose to be utilized more effectively.
* **Slightly slowing the absorption of glucose in your intestines:** This further helps regulate the amount of sugar entering your bloodstream after meals.

Metformin can be used alone or in combination with other diabetes medications, depending on individual needs and response.  In some cases, it may also be used to help prevent type 2 diabetes in individuals at high risk.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects are usually mild and may include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite.  These are most common at the start of treatment and often lessen with time or by taking the medication with food.
* **Metallic taste:** Some individuals report a metallic taste in their mouth.
* **Vitamin B12 deficiency:** Long-term use can sometimes lead to a deficiency in vitamin B12.  Regular blood tests can monitor for this.
* **Lactic acidosis (rare but serious):** This is a buildup of lactic acid in the blood, which can be life-threatening.  Risk factors include kidney disease, liver disease, heart failure, and excessive alcohol consumption.

Less common side effects may include:

* Headaches
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Skin rash


**How it Works:**

Metformin belongs to a class of drugs called biguanides.  Its precise mechanism isn't fully understood, but it primarily works by:

* **Reducing hepatic glucose production:** As mentioned above, this is a key action of metformin.
* **Increasing insulin sensitivity:** Metformin improves the effectiveness of insulin, making it easier for glucose to enter cells.
* **Decreasing intestinal glucose absorption:**  This slows down the rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream after eating.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can I take Metformin if I have kidney disease?** A: Metformin is generally not recommended for people with severe kidney disease due to the risk of lactic acidosis.  Your doctor will assess your kidney function before prescribing metformin.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Metformin?** A: Excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of lactic acidosis.  Moderate alcohol intake may be acceptable, but it's essential to discuss this with your doctor.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Can Metformin cause weight gain or weight loss?** A: Metformin generally doesn't cause significant weight gain, and it can sometimes lead to modest weight loss. However, individual responses vary.

* **Q:  How long does it take to see results?** A:  It can take several weeks to months to see the full benefits of Metformin in controlling blood sugar.

* **Q:  Are there any drug interactions?** A: Yes, metformin can interact with several medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
