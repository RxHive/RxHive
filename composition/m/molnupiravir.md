# Molnupiravir

**Generic Name:** Molnupiravir

**Usage:** Molnupiravir is an antiviral medication used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk of developing severe illness.  It's typically used as a short course of treatment (e.g., five days) and should be started as soon as possible after diagnosis.  **Important Note:**  Its use is now significantly limited due to the availability of more effective and safer treatments.  Consult a doctor before using it.  Its use should be guided by current treatment guidelines as efficacy may vary with virus variants.


**Side Effects:** Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Abdominal pain
* Fatigue

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Increased liver enzyme levels (indicating potential liver damage)
* Changes in blood cell counts
* Muscle pain

**How it Works:** Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analog.  It works by incorporating itself into the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during replication.  This incorporation leads to errors in the viral RNA, effectively mutating the virus and making it less able to replicate and infect other cells.  Essentially, it causes the virus to make so many mistakes in its replication that it becomes dysfunctional.

**FAQs:**
