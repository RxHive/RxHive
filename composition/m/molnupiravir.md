# Molnupiravir
### Generic Name
Molnupiravir

### Usage
Molnupiravir is an antiviral medication primarily used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults.  It's specifically indicated for patients who are at high risk of disease progression, including hospitalization or death. This typically includes individuals with underlying health conditions that increase their vulnerability to severe COVID-19.  Molnupiravir is an emergency use authorized medication and its use should be guided by a healthcare professional based on individual patient risk assessment.  It is *not* authorized for use in children under 18 years of age.


### Dosage
**For adults with COVID-19:** The recommended dosage is 800 mg (four 200 mg capsules) taken orally every 12 hours for five days. Treatment should begin as soon as possible after a COVID-19 diagnosis is made and within five days of symptom onset.  The capsules should be swallowed whole with water; they should not be crushed or chewed.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Molnupiravir is not authorized for use in patients under 18 years of age due to potential effects on bone and cartilage growth.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are typically necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment, or for elderly patients. However, always consult a physician for personalized guidance.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Dizziness
* Headache

Less common, but potentially serious side effects are possible.  It's crucial to report any concerning side effects to your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analog.  After it's taken, it's metabolized into an active form that interferes with the SARS-CoV-2 virus's replication process.  Specifically, it incorporates itself into the viral RNA, causing errors in the viral genome. These errors lead to impaired viral replication and reduce the virus's ability to spread.


### Precautions
* **Pregnancy:** Molnupiravir may cause birth defects (teratogenicity) and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for three months afterward.
* **Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for four days after the final dose due to unknown effects on the infant.
* **Hypersensitivity:** Molnupiravir should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* **Other Precautions:** Molnupiravir may increase the risk of mutagenicity (DNA changes) and muscle and bone damage.  Close monitoring and careful consideration of the risks and benefits are crucial, especially for vulnerable populations.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Molnupiravir with other medications?** A:  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as interactions are possible.
