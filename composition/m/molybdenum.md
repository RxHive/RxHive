# Molybdenum
### Generic Name
Molybdenum

### Usage
Molybdenum is an essential trace mineral.  Its primary use is in the treatment and prevention of molybdenum deficiency. This deficiency is relatively rare and is most often seen in individuals receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for extended periods, where the nutritional formula lacks sufficient molybdenum.  Molybdenum plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, acting as a cofactor for several enzymes involved in processing sulfur-containing amino acids and various other compounds, including purines and pyrimidines.  While not typically used to treat specific diseases directly, correcting a molybdenum deficiency can alleviate symptoms associated with that deficiency.

### Dosage

**Adults:**

* **Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA):** 45 mcg/day for both males and females.  This increases to 50 mcg/day during pregnancy and lactation.
* **Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN):**  20 mcg/day is typically added to TPN solutions to prevent deficiency. In cases of established molybdenum deficiency from prolonged TPN, a higher dose of 163 mcg/day for 21 days might be prescribed.

**Children:**

The RDA varies by age:

* <6 months: 2 mcg/day
* 6-12 months: 3 mcg/day
* 1-3 years: 17 mcg/day
* 3-8 years: 22 mcg/day
* 8-13 years: 34 mcg/day
* >13 years: 43 mcg/day


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Individuals with liver disease may experience higher blood levels of molybdenum, increasing the risk of side effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Renal Impairment:**  Similarly, those with kidney disease might experience elevated molybdenum levels, requiring careful monitoring and potential dosage modifications.

**Administration:**  Molybdenum is typically administered orally through supplements or intravenously (IV) as part of TPN solutions.


### Side Effects

* Gout-like symptoms (at high doses)

Serious side effects are uncommon at recommended dosages, but any unusual symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Molybdenum is a vital component of molybdopterin, a cofactor essential for the function of four enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC). These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, and other compounds.  By acting as a cofactor, molybdenum ensures these enzymes function correctly, enabling the body to efficiently process these essential substances.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Molybdenum should be used cautiously in individuals with copper deficiency as high molybdenum levels can interfere with copper absorption and metabolism.  Undiluted intravenous injection into a peripheral vein should be avoided due to the risk of phlebitis (inflammation of the vein).
* **Drug Interactions:**  While no significant drug interactions are commonly reported, it's always best to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Molybdenum should be used cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The benefits should outweigh the potential risks. It's essential to discuss this with your healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: What are the best dietary sources of molybdenum?**  A: Legumes, cereal grains, leafy green vegetables, beef liver, milk, and cheese are good dietary sources.

* **Q: Can I overdose on molybdenum?** A: While molybdenum toxicity is rare, excessive intake, especially through supplements, can lead to adverse effects. Always follow prescribed dosages.

* **Q: How is molybdenum stored?** A: Store molybdenum supplements according to the manufacturer's instructions. Usually, this involves storing them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Stop taking the supplement and contact your healthcare provider immediately to report any adverse reactions.

* **Q:  Is molybdenum testing necessary?** A:  Testing for molybdenum deficiency is usually only performed in individuals exhibiting specific symptoms and those receiving long-term TPN.  Your healthcare provider can determine if testing is warranted.
