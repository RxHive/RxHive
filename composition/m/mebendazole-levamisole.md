# Mebendazole + Levamisole

**Generic Name:** Mebendazole + Levamisole

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used to treat various types of intestinal worm infections, specifically:

* **Ascariasis:** Infection caused by roundworms ( *Ascaris lumbricoides*).
* **Trichuriasis:** Infection caused by whipworms (*Trichuris trichiura*).
* **Hookworm infection:** Infection caused by hookworms (*Necator americanus* and *Ancylostoma duodenale*).
* **Strongyloidiasis:** Infection caused by threadworms (*Strongyloides stercoralis*).  *(Note: While this combination is sometimes used, other treatments are often preferred for strongyloidiasis due to potential risks.)*


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Fever**
* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, itching, hives (in rare cases, more serious allergic reactions can occur).
* **Elevated liver enzymes:**  This is typically temporary and resolves after treatment ends, but monitoring may be necessary.
* **Blood disorders:**  Levamisole, in particular, can rarely cause blood disorders, including agranulocytosis (a dangerous decrease in white blood cells). This is a serious concern and requires immediate medical attention if suspected.

**How it Works:**

* **Mebendazole:** This is a benzimidazole anthelmintic. It works by interfering with the metabolism of the worms, specifically by inhibiting the uptake of glucose, which is essential for their survival. This leads to paralysis and eventual expulsion of the worms from the body.

* **Levamisole:** This is an anthelmintic that works differently than mebendazole. It stimulates the host's immune system to attack and destroy the parasites. It also has some neuromuscular blocking effects on the worms.  The combination of the two drugs enhances the effectiveness of treatment by targeting the worms through different mechanisms.


**FAQs:**

* **Is it safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women?** No, this combination is generally not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding due to potential risks to the mother and/or the baby.  Alternative treatments should be considered.

* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Yes, there can be drug interactions with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.

* **How long does treatment last?** The duration of treatment varies depending on the specific infection and the doctor's recommendations, but it is usually a short course of medication.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **When should I seek medical attention?** Seek immediate medical attention if you experience severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, signs of allergic reaction (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), or any other concerning symptoms.
