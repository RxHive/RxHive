# Mosapride
### Generic Name
Mosapride

### Usage
Mosapride is primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia, a condition affecting the digestive system that isn't caused by ulcers or other structural problems.  These symptoms commonly include heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.  It's important to note that Mosapride treats the symptoms, not the underlying cause of functional dyspepsia.  It's not typically used for other digestive disorders.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical adult dose is 5 mg three times daily (TID), taken orally before meals.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Mosapride in children have not been established, and it's not recommended for use in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional before using Mosapride if you have liver or kidney disease.

### Side Effects

If you experience any side effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your doctor or other healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Mosapride is a 5-HT4 receptor agonist.  This means it stimulates specific receptors (5-HT4) in the digestive tract.  By activating these receptors, Mosapride increases the release of acetylcholine and serotonin, neurotransmitters that help regulate gut motility and gastric emptying.  This improved function helps alleviate symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and heartburn associated with functional dyspepsia.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Mosapride is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity (allergy) to Mosapride or any of its components.

**Interactions:**  Erythromycin, an antibiotic, can increase Mosapride levels in the blood, potentially leading to increased side effects; therefore, concurrent use should be avoided.  Mosapride may also increase the risk of QT prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality) when used with other drugs that prolong the QT interval;  concomitant use is generally not recommended.  Consult your doctor about all medications you are taking before starting Mosapride.

**Warnings:**  Mosapride should be used cautiously in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction or bleeding.  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects and require closer monitoring. There's an increased risk of hepatotoxicity (liver damage).

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Mosapride is categorized as pregnancy category B.  This means animal studies have not shown harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  The safety of Mosapride during pregnancy has not been fully established.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Mosapride as excretion into breast milk is unknown.
