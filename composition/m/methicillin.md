# Methicillin
### Generic Name
Methicillin

### Usage
Methicillin is a semisynthetic penicillin antibiotic.  Its primary use was in treating infections caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* bacteria that were resistant to penicillin (namely, those producing penicillinase, an enzyme that breaks down penicillin).  It was particularly valuable in combating severe staphylococcal infections.  However, methicillin is no longer manufactured for widespread use due to the emergence of methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) and the availability of more stable and effective alternatives.

### Dosage
Because methicillin is no longer commercially produced, specific dosage information is not readily available for current medical practice.  Historically, dosage varied considerably depending on the severity of the infection, the patient's age and weight, and the route of administration (intravenous or intramuscular injection).  A healthcare professional would have determined the appropriate dose.

### Side Effects
While methicillin is no longer in use, it's important to understand its potential side effects, which were similar to other penicillins:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Interstitial nephritis (kidney inflammation),  anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction), eosinophilia (increased eosinophils in the blood),  thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)

**Note:** If any adverse effects occur, immediate medical attention is crucial.

### How it Works
Methicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic.  It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Specifically, it binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacteria.  This binding prevents the final step in the creation of peptidoglycan, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall.  The disruption of peptidoglycan synthesis weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis (rupture) and bacterial death.  Methicillin's resistance to beta-lactamases (enzymes that break down penicillins) was a key feature, making it effective against penicillinase-producing *Staphylococcus aureus*.

### Precautions
Given that methicillin is not currently used, specific precautions are largely historical.  However, it's important to know that, like other penicillins:

* **Allergy:**  A history of penicillin allergy is a major contraindication.
* **Kidney function:** Impaired kidney function could affect methicillin elimination, requiring dose adjustment (this was true during its use).
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of methicillin during pregnancy and breastfeeding would have required careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio by a physician (as with any medication).
* **Drug interactions:**  Methicillin could interact with certain medications; this would have needed to be considered by prescribing physicians during its use.

### FAQs
**Q: Is methicillin still available?**
A: No, methicillin is no longer manufactured for widespread medical use.

**Q: Why is methicillin no longer used?**
A: The widespread emergence of methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) rendered methicillin ineffective against many staphylococcal infections.  Additionally, newer penicillins with better stability and efficacy are available.

**Q: What are the alternatives to methicillin?**
A:  Other beta-lactam antibiotics (like oxacillin, flucloxacillin, and dicloxacillin), as well as other classes of antibiotics, are now used to treat staphylococcal infections.  The choice of antibiotic depends on the specific strain of bacteria and the patient's clinical condition.  A physician will determine the most appropriate treatment.

**Q:  What should I do if I have a penicillin allergy?**
A:  Inform all healthcare providers about your penicillin allergy.  Alternative antibiotics are available for bacterial infections.
