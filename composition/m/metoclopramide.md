# Metoclopramide

**Generic Name:** Metoclopramide

**Usage:**

Metoclopramide is used to relieve symptoms of nausea and vomiting.  It's commonly prescribed for:

* **Gastroparesis:** A condition where the stomach empties slowly.
* **Nausea and vomiting after surgery or chemotherapy:**  It helps to reduce these side effects.
* **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):** Although not a first-line treatment, it can sometimes be used to help relieve symptoms.
* **Diabetic gastroparesis:**  Specific to nausea and vomiting related to diabetes.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary in severity and frequency. Common side effects include:

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):** These are movement disorders that can include restlessness, muscle spasms (dystonia), tremors, and involuntary movements (tardive dyskinesia).  These are more common in higher doses and longer treatment durations.  Children and older adults are particularly at risk.
* **Drowsiness:**  This is a fairly common side effect.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose or watery stools.
* **Dry mouth:**  A lack of saliva.
* **Restlessness:**  Inability to sit still.


**Less common but more serious side effects include:**

* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** A rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
* **Severe allergic reactions:**  These can include rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, and difficulty breathing.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
* **Hypotension (low blood pressure):** Especially in patients already prone to low blood pressure.
* **Depression:**  In some cases, metoclopramide has been associated with depression.


**How it Works:**

Metoclopramide works by increasing the movement of food through the digestive tract. It does this in several ways:

* **Increasing gastric motility:**  It stimulates the muscles in the stomach and intestines, helping them contract more efficiently and move food along faster.
* **Relaxing the pyloric sphincter:** This is the muscle between the stomach and the small intestine.  Relaxing it allows food to move more easily into the small intestine.
* **Blocking dopamine receptors:**  This action in the brain helps to reduce nausea and vomiting.


**FAQs:**

* **How long can I take metoclopramide?**  The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated and should be determined by your doctor.  It's generally not intended for long-term use due to the risk of EPS.

* **Can I drive while taking metoclopramide?**  Drowsiness is a common side effect, so it's advisable to avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking metoclopramide?**  Combining alcohol with metoclopramide can increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking this medication.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't take two doses at once.

* **Can I take metoclopramide during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.
