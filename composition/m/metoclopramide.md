# Metoclopramide
### Generic Name
Metoclopramide

### Usage

Metoclopramide is primarily used to treat nausea and vomiting.  Its applications are diverse, ranging from managing symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders to preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  Specifically, it's approved for use in adults with documented, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux that doesn't respond to standard treatments, for alleviating symptoms of acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, and for preventing nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy.  Off-label uses, meaning uses not officially approved by regulatory bodies but supported by clinical evidence, are extensive and include treating migraines with severe nausea and vomiting, managing functional dyspepsia, and even assisting with hiccups.  It's also sometimes used in palliative care settings to improve comfort and manage gastrointestinal distress in patients with advanced cancer.  Importantly, its use in many of these off-label indications requires careful consideration and should be guided by a healthcare professional's expertise.

### Dosage

Metoclopramide dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal), and the patient's age and overall health.  There's no single, universally applicable dosage.  Consult the prescribing information for precise guidance, and always follow your doctor's instructions.  Below are examples, and not a complete guide to dosing, as it varies significantly by indication:

* **Adults:** Dosages typically range from 5 to 40 mg per day, divided into multiple doses.  Intravenous administration often involves lower initial doses (10 mg) which can be increased if necessary. For gastroparesis, doses can be titrated upward to 20 mg every 6 hours as tolerated.  Continuous IV or subcutaneous infusions might be used in certain situations, with careful titration to find the optimal dose. Intranasal sprays may contain a different dosage, usually 15 mg per spray.

* **Children:** Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight (mg/kg) and the specific condition.  For instance, in the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting, intravenous doses are adjusted according to weight, usually not exceeding 10mg per dose.  Always follow a physician's precise instructions for pediatric use.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of metoclopramide are generally mild and may include:

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Fatigue
* Restlessness

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) such as muscle spasms, tremors, and rigidity.  These are particularly concerning in children and the elderly.
* Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious movement disorder that can be irreversible.  TD is a significant risk with long-term metoclopramide use.
* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a rare but life-threatening condition.
* Allergic reactions, including rash and swelling.

If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Metoclopramide primarily acts by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain's chemoreceptor trigger zone, which is responsible for regulating nausea and vomiting.  At higher doses, it also blocks serotonin receptors. By blocking these receptors, it helps reduce the signals that trigger nausea and vomiting.  In addition, metoclopramide increases the movement of food through the digestive tract, which can help alleviate symptoms of gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It also increases the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter, preventing stomach acid reflux.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Metoclopramide should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug, pheochromocytoma, certain types of bowel obstructions, or a history of tardive dyskinesia.  It's contraindicated in infants under 1 year of age.

* **Drug Interactions:** Metoclopramide can interact with numerous other medications, including some antidepressants, antipsychotics, and opioids.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you're taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Metoclopramide should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding under strict medical supervision.  The potential benefits must outweigh the potential risks to the mother and/or infant.

* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly individuals are at a significantly higher risk of developing tardive dyskinesia, requiring close monitoring during treatment.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with kidney or liver problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take metoclopramide?** A: The duration of treatment varies significantly depending on the condition and response. Long-term use increases the risk of tardive dyskinesia, and generally, treatment should not exceed 12 weeks. Your physician will guide you on the appropriate duration.

* **Q: Can I take metoclopramide with alcohol?** A: Itâ€™s advisable to avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants while taking metoclopramide due to the increased risk of drowsiness and other side effects.

* **Q: How should I store metoclopramide?** A:  Store metoclopramide according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature and away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q:  Is metoclopramide habit-forming?** A: Metoclopramide is not considered a habit-forming drug in the same way as opioids or other addictive substances, but it can cause dependence if used chronically.
