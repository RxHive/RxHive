# Methylpolysiloxane + Aluminium Hydroxide + Magnesium Hydroxide

**Generic Name:** Methylpolysiloxane + Aluminium Hydroxide + Magnesium Hydroxide  (This is not a single, officially recognized generic name.  This combination is usually found under brand names and the specific ratios of ingredients vary.)

**Usage:**

This combination of ingredients is commonly used as an **antacid** to relieve the symptoms of heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach.  It's often used for the short-term relief of these symptoms.  The specific brand may have slightly different indications based on the formulation.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects are generally mild but can include:

* **Constipation:** This is a common side effect, particularly with aluminum-containing antacids.
* **Diarrhea:** More likely with magnesium-containing antacids.
* **Gas:**  Can be caused by the reaction of the antacids with stomach acid.
* **Nausea:** Though uncommon, some individuals may experience nausea.
* **Changes in bowel habits:**  These can range from constipation to diarrhea depending on the balance of magnesium and aluminum hydroxide.


**Rare but serious side effects:**  While infrequent, prolonged high doses of aluminum can contribute to aluminum accumulation in the body, particularly in those with kidney problems.  This requires monitoring by a doctor.

**How it Works:**

* **Methylpolysiloxane:** Acts as an antiflatulent (reduces gas). It helps to break down gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, making them easier to pass.
* **Aluminum Hydroxide:** Neutralizes stomach acid by reacting with it, thereby reducing acidity.
* **Magnesium Hydroxide:** Also neutralizes stomach acid but is a more potent laxative than aluminum hydroxide. The combination helps balance the constipating effect of aluminum with the laxative effect of magnesium.  The precise balance will vary by formulation.
