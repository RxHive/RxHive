# Maraviroc
### Generic Name
Maraviroc

### Usage
Maraviroc is an antiretroviral medication specifically designed to combat CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection.  It's crucial to understand that Maraviroc is not a standalone treatment; it's always used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs as part of a comprehensive HIV management strategy.  The primary use is in adults and children (weighing at least 2 kg) infected with HIV-1 where the virus primarily utilizes the CCR5 co-receptor to enter cells.  It's important to note that Maraviroc is ineffective against HIV-1 strains that use the CXCR4 co-receptor or a mix of both CCR5 and CXCR4.  Therefore, a tropism test is necessary before starting Maraviroc to ensure it's the appropriate treatment.


### Dosage

**Adults (HIV-1 infection):** The typical adult dose is 300 mg twice daily (BID) orally.

**Children (HIV-1 infection, ≥2 years and ≥30 kg):** For children aged 2 years and older weighing at least 30 kg, the dosage is generally the same as for adults (300 mg BID orally).  However, adjustments may be necessary depending on the presence of other medications in the treatment regimen (CYP3A inhibitors or inducers). Consult the prescribing information for specific details on these adjustments.  Dosages for children weighing less than 30 kg are not standardized and require careful consideration by a healthcare provider.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal and hepatic impairment can affect Maraviroc's dosage.  For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/minute, the use of Maraviroc may be contraindicated depending on the presence of certain other drugs. This is especially true if potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers are also being used. Consult a physician for guidance on dosage adjustments. The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment, but caution is advised.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting more than 10% of patients):**

* Skin rash
* Vomiting
* Infections (upper respiratory tract infections are common)
* Cough
* Fever

**Less Common, but Potentially Serious Side Effects (affecting 1-10% or less, some post-marketing):**

* Cardiovascular problems (hypertension, cardiac failure, stroke, etc.)
* Nervous system issues (dizziness, insomnia, neuropathy, depression, etc.)
* Liver problems (hepatitis, jaundice, increased liver enzyme levels)
*  Hematologic effects (anemia, neutropenia)
*  Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
* Severe allergic reactions, including DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.


**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Maraviroc works by blocking the CCR5 receptor on the surface of immune cells.  HIV-1 uses this receptor to enter and infect these cells. By preventing HIV-1 from binding to CCR5, Maraviroc effectively inhibits the virus from infecting the cells, slowing the progression of the disease.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Maraviroc is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components, and in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) taking certain other medications (potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers).  It's also contraindicated with concurrent use of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, or tenofovir.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Maraviroc interacts with many drugs, especially those metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme.  Concomitant use of certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, cimetidine, erythromycin, rifampin, etc.) should be avoided or carefully managed due to potential interactions affecting Maraviroc's efficacy and/or increasing the risk of side effects.

* **Warnings:**  Maraviroc carries a boxed warning regarding hepatotoxicity (liver damage).  Patients should be monitored closely for signs of liver dysfunction.  Also, there is a risk of serious allergic reactions and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before using Maraviroc.

* **Vulnerable Populations:**  Close monitoring is needed for patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disease, cardiovascular issues, or a history of allergic reactions.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Maraviroc with other medications?** A:  Maraviroc interacts with many other drugs. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist to ensure safe and effective combination therapy.


* **Q: How should I store Maraviroc?** A: Store Maraviroc as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.


* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for the next dose.  Do not take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose.


* **Q: Is Maraviroc effective against all types of HIV?** A: No.  Maraviroc only works against HIV-1 strains that use the CCR5 co-receptor to enter cells. A tropism test is essential to determine if Maraviroc is suitable for an individual's specific HIV strain.


* **Q: What if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.  Some side effects are minor and may resolve on their own, while others require medical attention.
