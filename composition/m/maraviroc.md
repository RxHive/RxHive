# Maraviroc

**Generic Name:** Maraviroc

**Usage:**

Maraviroc is an antiretroviral medication used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infection in adults.  It's specifically indicated for patients with HIV-1 who have a specific CCR5-tropic virus, meaning the virus uses the CCR5 receptor to enter cells.  A test to determine the tropism (the virus's use of CCR5 or CXCR4 receptors) is usually required before starting Maraviroc.  It is not a cure for HIV, but it helps to suppress the viral load and improve the CD4+ T cell count.  It is usually used as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects of Maraviroc include:

* **Nausea:** A frequent complaint, often manageable with dietary changes or anti-nausea medication.
* **Diarrhea:**  Can range from mild to severe; fluid and electrolyte balance should be monitored.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Headache:**  Generally mild and can be treated with over-the-counter pain relievers.
* **Rash:**  Can vary in severity; discontinue use and consult a doctor if severe.
* **Cough:**  May be related to respiratory infections.
* **Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver):**  Rare, but requires close monitoring of liver function tests.
* **Depression:**  Seek medical attention if experiencing persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness.

More serious, but less frequent, side effects include:

* **Severe allergic reactions:**  Seek immediate medical attention.
* **Liver problems:**  Monitor liver function regularly.
* **Increased risk of bacterial pneumonia:**  Requires careful monitoring for symptoms.

This is not an exhaustive list, and the severity and frequency of side effects can vary between individuals.  Always consult a healthcare provider if you experience any concerning side effects.


**How it Works:**

Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist.  This means it blocks the CCR5 receptor on the surface of immune cells, preventing HIV-1 from entering and infecting these cells.  Specifically, it binds to the CCR5 receptor, physically blocking the virus from using it as an entry point.  This reduces the viral load and helps the immune system to recover.  It is important to remember that Maraviroc only works against HIV-1 strains that use the CCR5 receptor; it is ineffective against CXCR4-tropic strains.


**FAQs:**

* **Q: Can Maraviroc cure HIV?** A: No, Maraviroc is not a cure for HIV.  It is used as part of a combination therapy to manage the infection and improve the patient's health.

* **Q: How often do I need to take Maraviroc?** A: The dosage and frequency depend on the individual and their overall treatment plan.  It's typically administered twice daily.

* **Q: What are the drug interactions?** A: Maraviroc can interact with other medications.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Certain medications like rifampin can significantly reduce Maraviroc's effectiveness.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects of Maraviroc?** A: Long-term effects are generally related to the ongoing management of HIV and potential side effects as mentioned above.  Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is essential.

* **Q:  Do I need a tropism test?** A: Yes, a tropism test (to determine whether your HIV is CCR5-tropic) is typically necessary before starting Maraviroc to ensure it will be effective.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Generally, it's important to take the medication as prescribed.
