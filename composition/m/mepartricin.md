# Mepartricin
### Generic Name
Mepartricin

### Usage
Mepartricin is a medication primarily used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition characterized by an enlarged prostate gland.  It also exhibits activity against vaginal mycosis (vaginal yeast infections).  While its primary application is in BPH, its antifungal and antiprotozoal properties suggest potential in other areas, though these remain largely unexplored in clinical practice.


### Dosage

**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):**

* **Adults:** The typical oral dose is 40 mg once daily.

**Vaginal Mycosis:**

* **Adults:**  One 40 mg vaginal capsule is administered daily for three days.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of mepartricin in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in pediatric populations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional before using mepartricin if you have liver or kidney disease.


### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Skin rash
* Headache
* Vertigo (dizziness)


Less common but serious side effects are not specifically detailed in available information.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Mepartricin functions as an estrogen reabsorption inhibitor. It interferes with the reabsorption of estrogens in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to increased fecal excretion of estrogen. This process ultimately reduces 17-Î² estradiol concentrations in enterohepatic circulation, consequently lowering estrogen levels in the prostate gland.  In the context of BPH, this reduction in estrogen levels helps alleviate the symptoms associated with the enlarged prostate.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mepartricin is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to mepartricin or any components of its formulation.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Mepartricin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  This means that animal studies have shown adverse effects, and there is no adequate data in pregnant women.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Excretion in breast milk is unknown; caution is advised if breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Administer mepartricin with food, preferably with the evening meal.
