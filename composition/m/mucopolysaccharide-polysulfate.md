# Mucopolysaccharide Polysulfate
### Generic Name
Mucopolysaccharide Polysulfate

### Usage
Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate is primarily used topically to treat superficial thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a superficial vein), and to relieve the symptoms of superficial bruising or hematoma (a collection of blood outside blood vessels).  It's a topical treatment, meaning it's applied directly to the skin.  It's not intended for internal use.

### Dosage
**Adults and Children â‰¥5 years:** For superficial thrombophlebitis, bruising, or hematoma, apply a ribbon of cream or gel (approximately 5-15 centimeters in length, depending on the affected area) to the affected area up to four times daily.  The concentration may vary (0.3% or 0.445% cream, 0.3% gel); follow the instructions on your specific product.

**Children <5 years:**  Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate is contraindicated (not recommended) for children under the age of 5.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment based on current manufacturer labeling.  Always consult a doctor if you have concerns.

### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site. These may include:

* Erythema (redness)
* Skin irritation

Less common, but more serious, side effects include hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions).  If you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms after using this medication, discontinue use and contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate works through multiple mechanisms. It's a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin E2 synthesis (prostaglandins are involved in inflammation) and alters the production of leukotriene B4 (another inflammatory mediator).  These actions contribute to its anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant (blood-thinning), thrombolytic (clot-dissolving), and anti-exudative (reducing fluid buildup) effects, helping to reduce inflammation and promote healing in superficial thrombophlebitis and bruising.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Mucopolysaccharide polysulfate should not be used if you have a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the medication or any of its components. It should also not be used on large areas of skin, broken skin, sensitive skin areas, mucous membranes, or in children under 5 years old.
* **Increased Risk:** There's an increased risk of local skin irritation or allergic reactions.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Topical use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not expected to cause significant exposure to the fetus or infant due to limited absorption.  However, it's always best to consult your doctor before using any medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Other Precautions:**  Some formulations may contain ingredients like cetostearyl alcohol, lanolin, propyl parahydroxybenzoate, ethyl parahydroxybenzoate, or propylene glycol, which can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.  The product is flammable; avoid flames and smoking while using it.  Clothing or bedding may become more flammable after contact with the medication; washing may reduce this risk.
