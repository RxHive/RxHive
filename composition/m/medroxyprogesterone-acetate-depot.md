# Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (Depot)
### Generic Name
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (Depot)

### Usage
Medroxyprogesterone acetate (depot) is a long-acting, injectable form of a synthetic progestin hormone.  Its primary use is as a female contraceptive, preventing pregnancy for an extended period.  A secondary, albeit significant, use is in the treatment of endometriosis, a condition where uterine tissue grows outside the uterus.  The depot formulation provides sustained release, offering convenience compared to daily oral contraceptives.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration (intramuscular [IM] or subcutaneous [SQ]).

**Contraception (Female):**

* **IM injection:** 150 mg every 3 months.  The first injection should ideally be given within 5 days of the onset of menstruation or within 5 days postpartum (after childbirth). If breastfeeding, the first injection should be administered 6 weeks postpartum.
* **SQ injection:** 104 mg every 3 months.  The timing of the first injection is the same as for the IM injection.

**Endometriosis:**

* **SQ injection:** 104 mg every 3 months for up to 2 years. The timing of the first injection follows the same guidelines as for contraception.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  For post-menarche females (after the onset of menstruation), the dosage is the same as for adults.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot is contraindicated in individuals with hepatic (liver) impairment.  No specific dosage adjustment is provided for renal (kidney) impairment, but caution is advised.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Edema (swelling)
* Irregular bleeding or spotting
* Changes in menstrual flow (including amenorrhea - absence of menstruation)
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Pain at the injection site
* Weakness

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Embolism (blood clot in a blood vessel)
* Thrombosis (blood clot formation)
* Mental depression
* Fever
* Insomnia (difficulty sleeping)
* Increased breast tenderness
* Weight changes
* Cholestatic jaundice (liver disorder)
* Thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a vein with clot formation)
* Melasma or chloasma (skin discoloration)
* Rashes


**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Medroxyprogesterone acetate works primarily by suppressing the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.  This, in turn, reduces the production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland.  The reduction in FSH and LH prevents the maturation of ovarian follicles and ovulation, thus preventing pregnancy. In the treatment of endometriosis, it alters the uterine lining, reducing the growth and symptoms associated with the condition.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot is contraindicated in women with:

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to medroxyprogesterone acetate
* Cerebrovascular disorders (stroke)
* Thromboembolic disorders (blood clots)
* Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding
* Suspected or known breast cancer
* Papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve)
* Retinal vascular lesions or sudden vision changes

**Warnings and Precautions:** Use with caution in individuals with:

* Cardiovascular disease
* Conditions exacerbated by fluid retention (e.g., heart failure, kidney disease, diabetes)
* History of or existing mental depression
* Smoking or alcohol abuse
* Long-term use (over 2 years)


Increased risks associated with medroxyprogesterone acetate depot include loss of bone mineral density (osteoporosis), vision changes, fluid retention, liver damage (hepatotoxicity), and worsening of depression.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Medroxyprogesterone acetate is contraindicated during pregnancy (Category X).  Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
