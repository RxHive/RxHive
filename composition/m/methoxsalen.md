# Methoxsalen
### Generic Name
Methoxsalen

### Usage
Methoxsalen is a medication primarily used in the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo.  It's a photosensitizing drug, meaning it makes the skin more sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light.  This property is harnessed in photochemotherapy, a treatment where methoxsalen is taken orally or applied topically, followed by exposure to controlled doses of UVA light (PUVA therapy).  This combined approach helps to slow the rapid skin cell growth characteristic of psoriasis and stimulate repigmentation in vitiligo, where patches of skin lose their color. While primarily used for psoriasis and vitiligo, there have been some limited investigations into its potential use in other skin conditions, but these remain largely experimental.


### Dosage

Dosage of methoxsalen varies significantly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and response to therapy, and the type of UV light used.  It's crucial to follow a physician's precise instructions.  There is no standardized pediatric dosage as its use in children is limited and requires careful monitoring.

* **Oral Dosage (for PUVA therapy):**  The initial dose is typically low and gradually increased under strict medical supervision.  A typical starting dose might be in the range of 0.6 mg/kg of body weight, but this can range widely, and subsequent doses are adjusted based on individual response and tolerance. This is usually administered 1-3 hours before UVA exposure.  Higher doses are not necessarily more effective and can lead to increased side effects.

* **Topical Dosage:** Topical application of methoxsalen is less common than oral administration for PUVA therapy. The dosage and application instructions will be specified by the prescribing physician and will vary based on the affected area and the specific formulation.


Dosage for intravenous administration is not typically used for methoxsalen; oral or topical application is the standard route.

**Important Note:**  The information above is for general understanding only.  Dosage must always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional experienced in photochemotherapy.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, sunburn-like reaction (erythema), itching, skin discoloration, and increased sensitivity to sunlight.

* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe sunburn, blistering, premature aging of the skin, cataracts, increased risk of skin cancer (with long-term use and/or excessive sun exposure), and liver damage.


If any side effects occur, particularly severe or persistent ones, it’s vital to seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Methoxsalen's mechanism of action is complex, involving its interaction with DNA and the skin's response to UV light. Upon absorption into the body, it enters skin cells and binds to DNA.  When the skin is then exposed to UVA light, this methoxsalen-DNA complex undergoes changes that alter the rate of skin cell division and growth. In psoriasis, this helps to slow down the rapid cell turnover. In vitiligo, the process is thought to stimulate the production of melanin (the pigment responsible for skin color), leading to repigmentation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Methoxsalen is contraindicated in patients with a history of porphyria, severe liver disease, and severe photosensitivity disorders.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding are also significant contraindications.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Methoxsalen can interact with several medications, including those that increase sensitivity to light or affect liver function.  It’s crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Patients undergoing PUVA therapy must rigorously protect their skin from sunlight before and after treatment. This includes wearing protective clothing and using high SPF sunscreen. Regular eye examinations are recommended due to the risk of cataracts. Long-term use requires careful monitoring by a dermatologist or healthcare professional experienced in photochemotherapy due to increased risk of skin cancer.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results with methoxsalen?** A: The response to methoxsalen varies significantly. Results might be noticeable within a few weeks of starting treatment for some patients but may take much longer in others.

* **Q: Is methoxsalen safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use of methoxsalen carries increased risks, particularly skin cancer and cataracts. It is crucial only to use it under strict medical supervision and monitoring.

* **Q: Can I take methoxsalen while pregnant or breastfeeding?** A:  No, methoxsalen is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

* **Q: How should I store methoxsalen?** A: Store methoxsalen as directed on the product label.  This typically involves keeping it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Never double a dose.  If you miss a dose, consult your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.
