# Methohexital Sodium
### Generic Name
Methohexital Sodium

### Usage
Methohexital sodium is a short-acting barbiturate primarily used for the induction of general anesthesia before surgery.  It works quickly to put a patient to sleep before the administration of other anesthetic agents that maintain anesthesia during longer procedures.  It's also used for short surgical procedures, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic procedures involving minimal pain.  Importantly, its use is generally confined to settings with continuous monitoring of vital signs due to its rapid action and potential for respiratory depression. Off-label uses include procedural sedation and the Wada test (to assess brain language dominance).

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Anesthesia (Induction):**  1-1.5 mg/kg IV push, administered at a rate of 10 mg over 5 seconds.
* **Anesthesia (Maintenance):** 20-40 mg (2-4 mL of 1% solution) IV push every 4-7 minutes, or 4-6 mg/min IV drip.
* **Procedural Sedation (Off-label):** 0.75-1 mg/kg IV;  doses of 0.5 mg/kg can be repeated every 2-5 minutes as needed.
* **Wada Test (Off-label, Intracarotid):** 3-4 mg over 3 seconds; a second dose of 2 mg over 2 seconds may be given if the patient shows signs of recovery.


**Pediatric Dosage (Off-label uses are common in pediatrics;  exercise extreme caution and consult specialist guidelines):** Dosages vary greatly based on age, weight, and the specific procedure.  Intramuscular (IM) and rectal routes are sometimes used in children, but IV administration is preferred when feasible.  Always refer to a pediatric anesthesiology specialist for appropriate dosage calculations.  The FDA warns against repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetics, including methohexital, in children under 3 years old and pregnant women in their third trimester due to potential effects on brain development.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment.  However, caution is warranted in patients with these conditions, as methohexital is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Nervous system: Headache, drowsiness, involuntary muscle movements, dizziness, restlessness.
* Cardiovascular: Hypotension (low blood pressure).
* Respiratory: Respiratory depression (slowed or shallow breathing).
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting.

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).
* Apnea (cessation of breathing).
* Circulatory shock.
* Seizures.
* Neuropathy (nerve damage, particularly at the injection site).


If any adverse effects occur, especially those listed above, immediately seek medical attention.

### How it Works

Methohexital sodium is a barbiturate anesthetic.  It works by enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter in the brain that reduces neuronal excitability.  This leads to a rapid onset of unconsciousness and loss of sensation.  Its ultra-short-acting nature is due to its rapid redistribution from the brain to other tissues and subsequent metabolism in the liver.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to barbiturates, porphyria, situations where general anesthesia is contraindicated (e.g., severe cardiovascular or respiratory disease).
* **Interactions:**  Methohexital has additive effects with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines). It can potentiate the hypotensive effects of certain medications.  Chronic use of barbiturates or phenytoin may reduce methohexital's effectiveness.
* **Warnings:**  Use with extreme caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, hepatic or renal impairment, severe anemia, obesity, or a history of seizures.  Elderly and debilitated patients require close monitoring.  The risk of respiratory depression is significant; therefore, continuous monitoring of vital signs is mandatory.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Methohexital is a Category B drug in pregnancy, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for methohexital to work?** A: Methohexital has a very rapid onset of action, typically within seconds to minutes of intravenous administration.

* **Q: How long does the effect of methohexital last?** A: The effects of methohexital are very short-lived, typically lasting only a few minutes to an hour, depending on the dose and individual factors.

* **Q:  Can I drive after receiving methohexital?** A: No.  Do not operate machinery or drive until fully recovered from the effects of the anesthesia.

* **Q: How is methohexital stored?** A:  Store methohexital according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually at controlled room temperature, protected from light and moisture.

* **Q:  Are there any long-term effects associated with methohexital?** A:  Methohexital is generally used for short-term procedures.  Long-term effects are rare but can include, potentially, cognitive issues if used repeatedly or improperly.
