# Minocycline

**Generic Name:** Minocycline

**Usage:** Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Acne vulgaris:**  It's often prescribed for moderate to severe acne.
* **Respiratory infections:** Such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis.
* **Skin infections:** Including cellulitis and impetigo.
* **Sexually transmitted infections (STIs):**  Such as chlamydia and gonorrhea (often in combination with other antibiotics).
* **Lyme disease:**  Often used in conjunction with other antibiotics.
* **Certain types of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other tick-borne diseases.**
* **Anthrax (post-exposure prophylaxis):**  Used to prevent infection after exposure.


**Side Effects:**  Minocycline can cause a range of side effects, some mild and some serious.  Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal issues:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite.
* **Headache**
* **Dizziness**
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight, leading to sunburn.
* **Vaginal yeast infections:** In women.
* **Tooth discoloration (especially in children):**  Should generally be avoided in children under 8 years old.

**Serious but less common side effects include:**

* **Liver damage:**  Monitor for jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine, and abdominal pain.
* **Kidney problems:**  Monitor for changes in urination.
* **Hearing loss:** This is rare but can be permanent.
* **Anemia (low red blood cell count)**

* **Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis:**  Rare but serious skin reactions.


**How it Works:** Minocycline works by binding to bacterial ribosomes, preventing protein synthesis. This inhibits the growth and reproduction of bacteria, ultimately leading to their death.  It is bacteriostatic (stops bacterial growth) at lower concentrations and bactericidal (kills bacteria) at higher concentrations.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take minocycline with milk or antacids?** No, calcium, magnesium, iron, and antacids can interfere with minocycline absorption.  Take it at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after these substances.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking minocycline?** Alcohol can worsen some side effects, particularly gastrointestinal issues.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking minocycline.
* **How long should I take minocycline?** The duration of treatment depends on the infection.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.
* **Can I take minocycline if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** Minocycline should generally be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.  Discuss this with your doctor.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs of an allergic reaction can include rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
