# Methionine
### Generic Name
Methionine

### Usage
Methionine's primary use is in the treatment of acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning to prevent liver damage.  It works by helping to reduce the toxic metabolites of acetaminophen that are responsible for liver injury.  While not a first-line treatment, it plays a crucial role in mitigating severe liver damage when administered within a specific timeframe after acetaminophen overdose.  It's also sometimes used to acidify urine, although this is a less common application.

### Dosage

**Acetaminophen Poisoning (Adult):**

* Oral: 2.5 grams every 4 hours for a total of 4 doses.  Crucially, methionine must be administered within 10 hours of acetaminophen ingestion for optimal effectiveness.

**Acidification of Urine (Adult):**

* Oral: 200 mg three or four times daily (TID or QID).


**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of methionine in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children without specific guidance from a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  In fact, methionine may worsen liver dysfunction in patients with pre-existing liver disease, necessitating careful consideration and potentially contraindicating its use in such cases.


### Side Effects

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Drowsiness

While rare, serious side effects are possible.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should prompt immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Methionine acts by several mechanisms in the context of acetaminophen overdose.  It primarily helps to reduce the formation of toxic metabolites of acetaminophen, thereby minimizing their damaging effects on liver cells.  It may also possess antioxidant properties, further protecting the liver from oxidative stress.  In its role in urine acidification, it alters the urinary pH, impacting the excretion of certain substances.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Methionine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to methionine or any of its formulation components.

**Warnings:**

* **Liver Disease:** Use with extreme caution in patients with pre-existing liver disease, as it might worsen the condition.
* **Metabolic Acidosis:**  Exercise caution in patients with metabolic acidosis.
* **MTHFR Deficiency:** Should be used cautiously in patients with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency.
* **Atherosclerosis:**  Caution is advised in patients with atherosclerosis.
* **Schizophrenia:**  Use with caution in patients with schizophrenia.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety and efficacy of methionine during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown.  It's categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning potential risks to the fetus cannot be ruled out.  Consult a healthcare provider before use.
* **Activated Charcoal Interaction:** Concomitant use of oral methionine and activated charcoal may reduce methionine's effectiveness.  Ideally, activated charcoal should be cleared from the system before methionine administration.

### FAQs

**Q: How is methionine stored?**
A: Methionine should be stored as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: Can I take methionine with other medications?**
A: Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Methionine may interact with other drugs, especially activated charcoal.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose.

**Q: What are the signs of an overdose?**
A: Overdosing on methionine can potentially worsen liver disease.  Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose.
