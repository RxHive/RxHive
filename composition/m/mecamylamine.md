# Mecamylamine
### Generic Name
Mecamylamine

### Usage
Mecamylamine is a medication primarily used to treat moderately severe to severe hypertension, including uncomplicated malignant hypertension.  It works by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses in the autonomic nervous system, specifically affecting the ganglia which control blood vessel constriction. This leads to a reduction in blood pressure.  While its primary use is in managing high blood pressure, it's important to note that due to its significant side effects and the availability of safer alternatives, mecamylamine is generally reserved for cases where other treatments have proven ineffective.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage (Hypertension):**  Mecamylamine is administered orally. The starting dose is typically 2.5 mg twice daily (BID).  This dose can be gradually increased to a maximum of 25 mg per day, divided into three doses, depending on the patient's response and blood pressure readings. Dose adjustments should be made in increments of 2.5 mg at intervals of no less than two days.  Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential during dose titration.

**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of mecamylamine in children have not been established, and it is not recommended for use in this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by manufacturers for hepatic (liver) impairment or mild-to-moderate renal (kidney) impairment.  However, extreme caution should be used in patients with significant renal impairment, as evidenced by elevated BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels.  Mecamylamine is contraindicated in patients with uremia (severe kidney failure).

### Side Effects
Common side effects of mecamylamine can include:

* Orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing)
* Dizziness
* Fatigue
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Blurred vision
* Dry mouth
* Weakness

Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Convulsions
* Altered mental status
* Paralytic ileus (intestinal obstruction)
* Pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs)
* Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue)
* Urinary retention

Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Mecamylamine is a ganglionic blocker. It works by competitively blocking the action of acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors located in autonomic ganglia.  Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating blood vessel tone. By inhibiting acetylcholine's action, mecamylamine prevents the signals that cause blood vessels to constrict, thus lowering blood pressure.  The blood pressure-lowering effect is predominantly orthostatic, meaning it's more pronounced when standing than when lying down.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Mecamylamine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, mild or moderate hypertension, coronary insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction, organic pyloric stenosis (narrowing of the stomach outlet), uremia, glaucoma, and when used concurrently with certain antibiotics or sulfonamides.
* **Interactions:**  Mecamylamine can interact with other medications, such as tizanidine (potentially enhancing its hypotensive effect), and ambenonium (contraindicated due to potentially dangerous interactions).  Always inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Mecamylamine is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risk to the fetus cannot be ruled out. It's also excreted in breast milk; therefore, a decision must be made regarding discontinuing breastfeeding or the medication, considering the importance of treatment for the mother.
* **Geriatric Patients and Patients with Other Conditions:**  Older adults and those with pre-existing conditions such as gastrointestinal obstruction, marked cerebral or coronary arteriosclerosis, prostatic hyperplasia, bladder obstruction, or urethral stricture should be carefully monitored while using mecamylamine.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store mecamylamine?** A: Store mecamylamine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking mecamylamine?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided as it can exacerbate the hypotensive effects of mecamylamine.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to catch up.

* **Q: Can I stop taking mecamylamine suddenly?** A: No, abrupt discontinuation can lead to rebound hypertension.  Always consult your doctor before stopping this medication.

* **Q: What are the signs of a serious side effect?** A: Serious side effects can include severe dizziness, fainting, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or seizures.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these symptoms.
