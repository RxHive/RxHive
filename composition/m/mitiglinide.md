# Mitiglinide
### Generic Name
Mitiglinide

### Usage
Mitiglinide is a medication used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.  It's not a first-line treatment; instead, it's used *in addition* to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control when those lifestyle changes aren't enough on their own.  It's specifically designed to help the pancreas release more insulin when needed.  Mitiglinide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Dosage
The typical adult dose of mitiglinide is 10 mg taken orally three times a day (TID), always immediately before meals.  The dosage may be adjusted by a doctor based on the individual's response to the medication and their blood sugar levels.  There is no established safe and effective dosage for children.  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dose adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment; however, caution is advised when using mitiglinide in these populations.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), increased risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack),  cardiomegaly (enlarged heart),  hepatic insufficiency (liver failure).  A wide range of other side effects have been reported, affecting various body systems (see detailed list in the original data).

**Important:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed as serious, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Mitiglinide is a meglitinide analog. It works by closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the beta cells of the pancreas. This depolarizes the cell membrane, causing calcium ions to enter the cell. The increased calcium levels trigger the release of insulin, thus lowering blood glucose levels.  It's important to note that this mechanism relies on the pancreas still having some functional beta cells.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Mitiglinide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to mitiglinide or its components; severe infections, before or after surgery, or with serious trauma;  pregnancy or suspected pregnancy; breastfeeding; severe ketosis; diabetic coma or pre-coma; and type 1 diabetes.
* **Interactions:**  Mitiglinide can interact with other medications, particularly other antidiabetic agents, sulfonylureas, direct-acting antiviral agents for Hepatitis C,  MAOIs, salicylates, and SSRIs.  These interactions may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Close monitoring is essential when using mitiglinide with these or other medications.
* **Warnings:** Mitiglinide can cause hypoglycemia.  Patients should be educated on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to manage them. There's also an increased risk of myocardial infarction.  Use caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment, ischemic heart disease, adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, or those who are elderly, debilitated, or malnourished.
