# Hyoscine
### Generic Name
Hyoscine (Scopolamine)

### Usage

Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is a medication with several uses depending on the salt form (hyoscine hydrobromide or hyoscine butylbromide) and route of administration.  It's a type of anticholinergic drug, meaning it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in various bodily functions.

**Primary Uses:**

* **Treatment of smooth muscle spasms:** Hyoscine butylbromide is primarily used to relieve spasms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and genitourinary tract. This can help manage conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), intestinal colic, and bladder spasms.

* **Prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting:** Hyoscine hydrobromide is effective in preventing motion sickness and reducing nausea and vomiting after surgery (postoperative nausea and vomiting).  Transdermal hyoscine patches are particularly useful for motion sickness prevention.

**Secondary Uses:**

* **Preoperative sedation and amnesia:** Hyoscine hydrobromide can be used as a premedication before surgery to induce sedation and reduce anxiety and memory of the procedure.

* **Ophthalmic use:**  Hyoscine hydrobromide eye drops are used to dilate the pupils (mydriasis) and paralyze the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia) for eye examinations (refraction) and in the management of iridocyclitis (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body).


### Dosage

**Important Note:** Hyoscine hydrobromide and hyoscine butylbromide are *not* interchangeable. Their dosages are significantly different.  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.  The information below provides general dosage ranges; individual needs vary.

**Hyoscine Butylbromide:**

* **Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Spasm:**
    * **Oral:** 10-20 mg/day (acute) or 10 mg 3-5 times/day (prolonged). Maximum daily dose: 60 mg.
    * **Injection (IM, IV, SubQ):** 10-20 mg/day. May repeat after 30 minutes if needed. Maximum daily dose: 100 mg.

* **Pediatric Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Spasm:**
    * **Ages 6-11:** 10 mg three times daily (oral).
    * **Ages 12+:** Same as adult dosage.


**Hyoscine Hydrobromide:**

* **Motion Sickness (Prophylaxis):**
    * **Oral:** 300 mcg 30 minutes before travel; repeat every 6 hours as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours.  Maximum daily dose: 900 mcg.
    * **Transdermal Patch (1 mg/72 hours):** Apply one patch behind the ear at least 4 hours before travel.  For motion sickness, leave the patch on for 3 days. For post-operative nausea, remove after 24 hours.

* **Motion Sickness (Pediatric Prophylaxis):**
    * **Ages 3-4:** 75 mcg 20 minutes before travel; repeat as needed. Maximum daily dose: 150 mcg.
    * **Ages 4-10:** 75-150 mcg 20 minutes before travel; repeat every 6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 450 mcg.
    * **Ages 10+:** 150-300 mcg 20 minutes before travel; repeat every 6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 900 mcg.

* **Nausea & Vomiting (Treatment):**
    * **Injection (IV, IM, SubQ):** 0.3-0.6 mg. Repeat every 6-8 hours if needed.  Pediatric dose: 0.006 mg/kg.

* **Preoperative Sedation/Premedication:**
    * **Injection (IV, IM, SubQ):** 0.3-0.6 mg three or four times daily (sedation) or 0.2-0.6 mg 30-60 minutes before anesthesia. Pediatric premedication: 15 mcg/kg 30-60 minutes before anesthesia.

* **Ophthalmic (Mydriasis & Cycloplegia):**
    * **0.25% solution:** Instill 1-2 drops 1 hour before examination (refraction) or 1 drop up to three times daily for iridocyclitis. Pediatric ophthalmic use follows similar guidelines, but may involve BID for 2 days before examination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Difficulty urinating
* Flushing
* Fast heartbeat (tachycardia)

Less common but serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* High fever
* Confusion
* Hallucinations
* Seizures


If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Hyoscine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in stimulating smooth muscles and glands.  By blocking acetylcholine's effects, hyoscine reduces muscle spasms in the GI and genitourinary tracts, decreases secretions (leading to dry mouth), and reduces the signals that cause nausea and vomiting. In the eye, it causes pupil dilation and ciliary muscle paralysis.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hyoscine is contraindicated in individuals with certain conditions, including narrow-angle glaucoma, megacolon, prostatic hypertrophy with urinary retention, and hypersensitivity to the drug.  Specific contraindications vary depending on the salt form and route of administration.

* **Drug Interactions:** Hyoscine can interact with several other medications, including anticholinergic agents, antidepressants, and some diuretics.  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Hyoscine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are not fully known.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered. Hyoscine is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised for breastfeeding mothers.

* **Specific Populations:**  Older adults, children, and individuals with liver or kidney problems may require dosage adjustments or close monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive after taking hyoscine?** A:  Drowsiness and blurred vision are potential side effects. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how hyoscine affects you.

* **Q: How should I store hyoscine?** A: Store as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the dose; simply take the next dose as scheduled.

* **Q:  How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the formulation and route of administration; it can range from minutes (injection) to hours (oral or transdermal).

* **Q: Can I take hyoscine with alcohol?** A:  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of hyoscine, particularly drowsiness and dizziness. Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment.

* **Q:  What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** A: Contact your doctor or a poison control center immediately.
