# Hydroxychloroquine

**Generic Name:** Hydroxychloroquine

**Usage:**

Hydroxychloroquine is primarily used to prevent and treat malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax*, *P. ovale*, *P. malariae*, and sensitive strains of *P. falciparum*.  It's also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases, including:

* **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA):** To reduce inflammation and joint pain.
* **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus):** To manage symptoms like joint pain, fatigue, and skin rashes.
* **Discoid lupus:** A form of lupus affecting the skin.
* **Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT):** A rare disorder affecting the skin's sensitivity to sunlight.

**Note:**  Its use for COVID-19 is not supported by robust scientific evidence and is generally not recommended.

**Side Effects:**

Hydroxychloroquine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur. These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and loss of appetite.
* **Less common but potentially serious side effects:**  Retinopathy (damage to the retina), heart problems (arrhythmias), liver damage, blood disorders (agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia), muscle weakness, and skin rashes.  These require immediate medical attention.
* **Long-term use:**  Long-term use can increase the risk of retinopathy, so regular eye exams are crucial.


**How it Works:**

Hydroxychloroquine's mechanism of action is complex and varies depending on the condition it's treating.  In malaria, it interferes with the parasite's ability to digest hemoglobin, preventing its growth and reproduction.  In autoimmune diseases, it's believed to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the overactive immune response.  The exact mechanisms for its effects in autoimmune diseases are still under investigation.
