# Hydrocortisone Enema
### Generic Name
Hydrocortisone Enema

### Usage

Hydrocortisone enema is used as an adjunctive therapy in managing ulcerative colitis, specifically affecting the distal parts of the large intestine. This includes conditions like ulcerative proctitis (affecting the rectum), ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (affecting the rectum and sigmoid colon), and left-sided ulcerative colitis (affecting the left side of the colon).  It's crucial to understand that hydrocortisone enema is not a standalone cure for ulcerative colitis but works to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms, allowing other treatments to be more effective.


### Dosage

**Adults:** For ulcerative proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, and left-sided ulcerative colitis, the typical dosage is one 100 mg/60 mL enema rectally at night for 21 days, or until clinical and proctological remission (improvement) is observed.  Symptoms often improve within 3-5 days. If no improvement is seen within 2-3 weeks, the treatment should be stopped. In some cases, treatment may last 2-3 months. If the treatment extends beyond 21 days, the hydrocortisone should be gradually withdrawn over 2-3 weeks by administering it every other night.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of hydrocortisone enema in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are not explicitly defined in the provided data but may include those associated with systemic corticosteroid use, including:

*   Fluid and electrolyte imbalances (sodium retention, fluid retention, potassium loss)
*   Musculoskeletal issues (muscle weakness, osteoporosis)
*   Gastrointestinal problems (peptic ulcers, pancreatitis)
*   Skin changes (thinning skin, impaired wound healing)
*   Neurological effects (headache, increased intracranial pressure)
*   Endocrine disturbances (menstrual irregularities, Cushingoid state)
*   Ophthalmic issues (cataracts, glaucoma)
*   Metabolic changes (negative nitrogen balance)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects can also occur.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid, a type of steroid hormone. It works by reducing inflammation in the bowel.  It achieves this by suppressing the movement of inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMNs) to the affected area and by reducing increased permeability of capillaries (small blood vessels), thus minimizing swelling and irritation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hydrocortisone enema is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or any formulation components, systemic fungal infections, and in the immediate postoperative period following ileocolostomy.

* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency and psychic derangement.

* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with conditions such as impending abscesses, pyogenic infections, perforation, hypothyroidism, cirrhosis, ocular herpes simplex, latent tuberculosis, active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis. Concurrent use with aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, salicylates, antimuscarinic agents, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, barbiturates, rifampicin, ciclosporin, estrogens, or oral contraceptives should be carefully considered due to potential interactions.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Hydrocortisone enema is classified as Category C in pregnancy.  The potential benefits should be carefully weighed against the risks. Neonates born to mothers who received substantial doses during pregnancy should be monitored for hypoadrenalism. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
