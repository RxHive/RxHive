# Hydroxyethyl StarchHES + Sodium Chloride

**Generic Name:** Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES) + Sodium Chloride (NaCl)

**Usage:**  This combination is used intravenously (IV) to expand the volume of blood plasma.  The HES component acts as a plasma volume expander, while the sodium chloride provides electrolytes.  Specific uses include:

* **Hypovolemia:** Treatment of low blood volume due to trauma, surgery, burns, or other conditions causing fluid loss.
* **Shock:**  In conjunction with other treatments, to improve blood flow and tissue perfusion during shock.
* **Hemodilution:**  A component of certain surgical procedures to reduce blood viscosity.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can range from mild to severe and vary depending on the concentration and dose of HES used.  Common side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, hives, shortness of breath, swelling.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Relatively common, especially with higher doses.
* **Headache:**  Mild to moderate headache.
* **Changes in blood clotting:**  HES can interfere with blood clotting, potentially increasing bleeding risk or predisposing to thromboembolic events (blood clots). This is a serious concern.
* **Renal impairment:**  Kidney damage is a potential and serious side effect, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those receiving high doses or high molecular weight HES.
* **Fluid overload:**  Overhydration can occur if too much fluid is administered.  This can lead to pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), heart failure exacerbation, and other complications.
* **Itching:**  Can be a prominent side effect.


**How it Works:**

* **Hydroxyethyl Starch (HES):** This is a colloid solution, meaning it contains large molecules that remain in the bloodstream for a longer period than crystalloid solutions (like saline alone). This prolonged presence in the bloodstream increases blood volume and improves blood pressure by increasing the osmotic pressure.  It pulls fluid from the interstitial space (the space between cells) into the bloodstream.
* **Sodium Chloride (NaCl):** This is an electrolyte solution crucial for maintaining fluid balance, nerve function, and muscle contraction. It also helps prevent electrolyte imbalances that can occur during fluid loss.  The combination of HES and NaCl provides both volume expansion and electrolyte replenishment.


**FAQs:**

* **Is HES + NaCl better than saline alone?**  The decision to use HES + NaCl versus saline alone depends on the specific clinical situation and the patient's condition.  While HES provides longer-lasting volume expansion, the risk of side effects, particularly kidney damage and clotting problems, must be carefully weighed. Saline is generally preferred as a first-line treatment for hypovolemia unless specific circumstances warrant the use of a colloid like HES.
* **How long does the effect last?**  The duration of HES's effect depends on the molecular weight and concentration of the solution used.  Higher molecular weight HES stays in the bloodstream longer.
* **Who shouldn't receive HES + NaCl?**  Patients with severe kidney disease, bleeding disorders, severe heart failure, or known allergy to HES should generally not receive this combination.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should also exercise caution.
* **Are there any long-term effects?**  Long-term effects are a concern, especially regarding renal impairment. Studies have shown an association between HES use and increased risk of kidney injury, particularly with high doses or high-molecular-weight HES.
* **What are the different types of HES?** HES solutions vary in molecular weight and concentration, which affects their duration of action and side effect profile.  The choice of specific HES solution is made by the physician based on the individual patient's needs.
