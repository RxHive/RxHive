# Haloperidol Decanoate

**Generic Name:** Haloperidol Decanoate

**Usage:**

Haloperidol Decanoate is a long-acting antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  It's primarily used for maintenance therapy in patients who have responded well to oral haloperidol and require long-term treatment to prevent relapse.  It's administered via intramuscular injection, typically every 2-4 weeks, depending on individual patient needs and response.  It's not typically used for acute psychosis management; that requires a faster-acting medication.

**Side Effects:**

Haloperidol Decanoate can cause a wide range of side effects, some common and others more serious. These can include:

* **Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS):**  These are movement disorders that can include akathisia (restlessness), parkinsonism (rigidity, tremor, slow movement), dystonia (muscle spasms), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary, repetitive movements, particularly of the face, mouth, and tongue â€“ this can be irreversible).
* **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS):** A rare but potentially fatal side effect characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability.  Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Sedation and drowsiness:**  Common, particularly initially.
* **Weight gain:** Can be significant in some patients.
* **Hyperprolactinemia:** Increased levels of prolactin (a hormone), which can lead to menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea (breast milk production), and sexual dysfunction.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** A drop in blood pressure upon standing, causing dizziness or lightheadedness.
* **Cardiovascular effects:**  Can affect heart rhythm in some cases.
* **Metabolic effects:**  Increased risk of diabetes and dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides).
* **Constipation:** Relatively common.
* **Blurred vision:**  Can occur in some patients.


**How it Works:**

Haloperidol Decanoate is a dopamine receptor antagonist.  This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  In schizophrenia and other psychoses, an imbalance of dopamine is thought to play a role in the development of symptoms. By blocking dopamine receptors, haloperidol decanoate helps reduce these symptoms.  The decanoate formulation allows for a slow release of the medication over several weeks, providing sustained therapeutic effects.

**FAQs:**

* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of haloperidol decanoate are not immediate. It typically takes several weeks to reach its full therapeutic effect.
* **Is it addictive?** Haloperidol decanoate is not physically addictive in the same way as opioids. However, psychological dependence can occur in some individuals.  Abrupt cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult with a doctor before stopping treatment.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking it?**  Alcohol can worsen the sedative effects of haloperidol decanoate and should be avoided or severely limited.
* **Can I drive while taking it?**  Sedation and drowsiness are common side effects. Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
* **What are the risks of long-term use?** Long-term use carries an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia and other EPS, as well as metabolic side effects.  Regular monitoring is essential.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Contact your doctor or psychiatrist immediately for guidance. Do not attempt to double up on doses.
