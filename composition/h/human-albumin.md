# Human Albumin
### Generic Name
Human Albumin

### Usage
Human albumin is a plasma volume expander and colloid primarily used to restore and maintain circulating blood volume when a deficiency has been confirmed and colloid use is deemed appropriate.  Its primary application lies in treating hypovolemia (low blood volume), often stemming from conditions like bleeding, burns, or surgery.  It's also notably used in situations requiring fluid mobilization, such as in cases of severe ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen).  Secondary uses include supporting patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis (removal of abdominal fluid), managing adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), treating ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and aiding in plasma exchange procedures.  Off-label use sometimes includes treating spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.


### Dosage
Dosage varies significantly depending on the patient's age, weight, specific condition, and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's guidance meticulously.  The following provides a general overview and should not replace professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Hypovolemia:**  Initial intravenous (IV) dose of 25g of the 5% solution, potentially repeated after 15-30 minutes if needed.  The 25% solution may be used if fluid and sodium restriction is necessary.
* **ARDS:** 25g over 30 minutes (often with furosemide), potentially repeated every 8 hours for up to 3 days.
* **Large-volume paracentesis:** 5-10g (or 8g per liter removed) of the 25% solution for each liter of fluid removed, administered soon after the procedure.
* **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome:** 50-100g of the 25% solution over 4 hours, with potential repeat doses every 4-12 hours.
* **Plasma exchange:** Dose titrated to match plasma volume removed during the procedure.

**Children:** Dosages for children are significantly lower and are weight-based. They are typically calculated as grams per kilogram (g/kg) of body weight and administered intravenously. Specific dosages vary depending on the condition being treated (e.g., ascites, hypovolemia, nephrotic syndrome). Always consult pediatric dosage guidelines.


**Administration:** Human albumin solutions are administered intravenously. The rate of infusion depends on the concentration of the solution and the patient's condition.  Slow administration is generally preferred to avoid adverse effects.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Chills
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Skin rash
* Itching (pruritus)
* Hives (urticaria)
* Fever

Less common, but serious, side effects are possible:

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Cardiac failure
* Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
* Bronchospasm
* Hypervolemia (excess fluid volume)
* Coagulation abnormalities
* Electrolyte imbalances


**Important:** If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Human albumin is a protein naturally found in human blood.  It increases the oncotic pressure (osmotic pressure exerted by proteins) in the blood vessels, drawing fluid from the surrounding tissues into the bloodstream. This action effectively expands the plasma volume and improves blood circulation. The increased blood volume helps restore tissue perfusion and improve organ function in conditions where blood volume is depleted.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Human albumin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to albumin or any component of the formulation, severe anemia, heart failure, and those at high risk of fluid overload (such as patients with renal insufficiency).  It should not be diluted with sterile water for injection.
* **Interactions:** While direct drug interactions are uncommon,  it is important to inform healthcare providers of all medications being taken.
* **Special Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, those requiring sodium restriction, and in neonates and children.  Pregnant women should only receive human albumin if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. The presence of endogenous albumin in breast milk should be considered when making breastfeeding decisions during therapy.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is human albumin stored?** A:  Storage conditions vary depending on the specific formulation. Always refer to the product labeling for precise storage instructions.  Generally, solutions should be stored at room temperature and protected from light.  Discard any unused portion after the recommended timeframe.
* **Q: Can I take human albumin without a doctor's prescription?** A: No. Human albumin is a prescription medication and should only be administered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Since human albumin is administered intravenously in a hospital setting, missing a dose is usually managed by medical professionals. Discuss any concerns with the treating physician.
* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with human albumin use?** A: Long-term effects are generally uncommon, but potential risks associated with fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances should be monitored.
* **Q: Is human albumin safe?** A: When administered appropriately under medical supervision, human albumin is generally considered safe. However,  like any medication, there is a potential for side effects, and close monitoring is essential.
