# Hydroxyquinolines
### Generic Name
Hydroxychloroquine

### Usage

Hydroxychloroquine is primarily used to treat malaria, a disease caused by parasites transmitted through mosquito bites.  It's effective against certain types of malaria caused by *Plasmodium vivax*, *Plasmodium ovale*, and *Plasmodium malariae*, though it's less effective against *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria, especially resistant strains.  Therefore, it's often used in combination with other antimalarial drugs for treating *P. falciparum* infections.

Beyond malaria, hydroxychloroquine has found significant use in managing autoimmune diseases. Its most common non-malarial application is in treating rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory condition.  It can help reduce joint pain, swelling, and stiffness.  It's also sometimes used to treat lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus), a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect multiple organs, and discoid lupus, which primarily affects the skin.  Additionally, it may be prescribed for certain types of porphyria (a group of genetic disorders affecting heme production) and in some cases of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the form of the medication (typically tablets).  It's crucial to follow the prescription provided by your doctor precisely.  Self-medication is strongly discouraged.

**Malaria Prevention:**  The dosage for malaria prophylaxis (prevention) is usually determined based on body weight and the level of malaria risk in the travel region.  Your doctor will provide specific instructions.

**Malaria Treatment:** Treatment dosages for malaria are higher and vary depending on the type of malaria and its severity.  This is strictly a doctor-prescribed and managed treatment.

**Rheumatoid Arthritis and other Autoimmune Diseases:**  For rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions, the initial dosage is typically low and gradually increased as tolerated. The exact dosage will be determined by your doctor, based on your condition and response to treatment. This is often a long-term medication requiring regular monitoring.

**Oral Administration:** Hydroxychloroquine is typically administered orally as tablets.

**Intravenous Administration:**  Intravenous (IV) administration of hydroxychloroquine is not a standard practice and is generally only considered in very specific circumstances, such as when oral administration is impossible.  This requires strict medical supervision.

**Children:** Dosage for children is determined by their weight and the specific condition.  A doctor will calculate the appropriate dose.  This is not a medication that should be given to children without explicit medical supervision.

**Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and administration.**


### Side Effects

* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, dizziness.
* **Less common, but potentially serious side effects:**  Eye problems (retinopathy â€“ damage to the retina), skin reactions, muscle weakness, heart problems, blood disorders.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).


If you experience any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.  Regular eye exams are crucial while on this medication to monitor for potential retinal damage.


### How it Works

Hydroxychloroquine's mechanism of action is complex and not fully understood, but it's believed to involve several processes.  In malaria, it interferes with the parasite's ability to reproduce and survive within red blood cells.  In autoimmune diseases, it's thought to work by modifying the immune system's response, reducing inflammation and suppressing the activity of immune cells that contribute to the disease process.  Its exact effect on autoimmune responses remains an area of ongoing research.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hydroxychloroquine should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug.
* **Drug Interactions:** It can interact with several other medications, so informing your doctor about all medications you are taking is crucial.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The use of hydroxychloroquine during pregnancy and breastfeeding requires careful consideration and should be discussed with your doctor.  The potential benefits must be weighed against potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Liver and Kidney Disease:** Patients with liver or kidney disease require careful monitoring while on this medication.
* **Eye Exams:** Regular eye examinations are necessary to monitor for retinopathy, a potential side effect.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more susceptible to side effects and require closer monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The time it takes to see effects varies depending on the condition being treated.  For malaria, effects are usually seen relatively quickly.  For autoimmune diseases, it may take several weeks or months to see significant improvement.

* **Q: Can I stop taking it suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping hydroxychloroquine can be harmful, especially for those with autoimmune conditions.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and discontinuation.

* **Q: How should I store it?** A: Store hydroxychloroquine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: Is it addictive?** A: No, hydroxychloroquine is not addictive.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking it?** A:  While not strictly contraindicated, excessive alcohol consumption is generally discouraged while taking any medication, including hydroxychloroquine.  Always consult your doctor.
