# Human Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin

**Generic Name:** Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG)

**Usage:**  Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is used to prevent hepatitis B infection in people exposed to the virus.  This is primarily given in the following situations:

* **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):**  Administered after exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), such as through a needlestick injury, sexual contact with an infected person, or perinatal exposure (mother to baby).  The sooner it's given after exposure, the better it works.
* **Prevention in newborns born to HBV-infected mothers:** Given to newborns of HBV-positive mothers to prevent infection.  This is usually combined with the Hepatitis B vaccine.
* **Immunocompromised individuals:**  May be used in certain situations for individuals with compromised immune systems who haven't responded adequately to the Hepatitis B vaccine.

**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally mild and infrequent.  They may include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
* Mild fever.
* Headache.
* Muscle aches.
* Dizziness.
* Nausea.

Rarely, more serious allergic reactions can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing, or a rapid heartbeat.


**How it Works:** HBIG contains antibodies against the hepatitis B virus. These antibodies are obtained from the plasma of human donors who have high levels of antibodies against HBV.  When injected, these antibodies bind to the hepatitis B virus, neutralizing it and preventing it from infecting liver cells.  This provides passive immunity, meaning the body receives pre-formed antibodies rather than producing its own.  This protection is temporary, typically lasting only a few weeks or months.


**FAQs:**

* **How long does HBIG protection last?**  The protection offered by HBIG is temporary, usually lasting only 2-3 months.  This is why it is often given in conjunction with the Hepatitis B vaccine to provide longer-lasting protection.

* **Is HBIG a vaccine?** No, HBIG is not a vaccine.  Vaccines stimulate the body's own immune system to produce antibodies against HBV, providing long-term protection.  HBIG provides immediate, passive protection from pre-formed antibodies.

* **Are there any contraindications to receiving HBIG?**  While generally safe, there are some contraindications, such as a severe allergic reaction to previous HBIG injections or components of the product.  Your doctor will assess your individual health status to determine if HBIG is appropriate for you.

* **What are the risks associated with receiving HBIG?**  Risks are generally low, but include the potential for allergic reactions (rare) and transmission of bloodborne pathogens (extremely rare due to strict screening of donors).

* **How is HBIG administered?** HBIG is typically administered as a single intramuscular injection, although the dosage and number of injections may vary depending on the situation.
