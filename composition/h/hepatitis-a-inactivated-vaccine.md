# Hepatitis A Inactivated Vaccine
### Generic Name
Hepatitis A Inactivated Vaccine

### Usage

The Hepatitis A inactivated vaccine is used to actively immunize individuals against Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection.  Its primary use is to prevent Hepatitis A, a liver infection caused by the HAV.  Secondary uses include postexposure prophylaxis (given after potential exposure to the virus) and outbreak control in populations at risk.  The vaccine is recommended for individuals traveling to areas with a high prevalence of Hepatitis A, those with chronic liver disease, and others at increased risk.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on age, formulation of the vaccine, and the reason for administration (primary immunization, postexposure prophylaxis, or outbreak control).  Always consult the specific product labeling for precise dosage instructions as formulations vary in strength.  The following is a summary and may not reflect all available formulations:


**Adults (≥12 years):**

* **Primary Immunization:**  Typically, a two-dose series is administered intramuscularly (IM).  The interval between doses depends on the specific formulation but generally ranges from 6 to 36 months.  Consult product labeling for exact scheduling.

* **Postexposure Prophylaxis:** A single dose is administered IM as soon as possible after exposure (ideally within 14 days). A second dose to complete the series is recommended for long-term protection.

* **Outbreak Control:** A single dose is given IM to unvaccinated individuals at risk.

**Children ( <12 years):**

Dosage and scheduling for children vary significantly depending on age and vaccine formulation. The recommended schedule typically involves a two-dose series given IM, with the interval between doses varying with the specific vaccine.  Consult the product labeling or a healthcare professional for detailed age-specific guidelines.  Pre-exposure prophylaxis for infants aged 6 to <12 months traveling to high-risk areas may involve a single dose, but this does not replace the standard two-dose childhood schedule.


**Important Note:**  The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends using the same manufacturer's vaccine for both doses of the series whenever possible.  If this is not feasible, an available Hepatitis A vaccine may be used.


### Side Effects

The Hepatitis A vaccine is generally well-tolerated, but some side effects can occur.

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients):**

* Pain, redness, swelling, or tenderness at the injection site
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Drowsiness
* Irritability
* Decreased appetite
* Fever

**Less Common, but More Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of recipients or reported post-marketing):**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Neurological problems (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome, although extremely rare)
* Other serious reactions


If any serious or unusual side effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

The Hepatitis A inactivated vaccine contains inactivated (killed) Hepatitis A virus. When injected, this stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the virus.  These antibodies provide protection against future infection by the Hepatitis A virus.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:** The vaccine should not be given to individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine, including neomycin.
* **Bleeding disorders:**  Use caution in individuals with bleeding disorders.
* **Immunocompromised individuals:**  The vaccine may be less effective in people with weakened immune systems. Consult a healthcare professional before vaccination.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While the vaccine is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, consult a doctor to discuss the risks and benefits.
* **Interactions:** Immunosuppressant medications may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness. Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor.
* **Syncope:**  There is a small risk of fainting (syncope) after vaccination.  Remain seated or lying down for 15 minutes after the injection.


### FAQs

**Q: How long does the protection from the Hepatitis A vaccine last?**

A:  Generally, the protection from the two-dose Hepatitis A vaccine series lasts for many years, possibly a lifetime for most people.

**Q: Can I receive the Hepatitis A vaccine at the same time as other vaccines?**

A: Yes, often other vaccines can be given concurrently with the Hepatitis A vaccine, but always check with your doctor or healthcare provider.

**Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?**

A: Most side effects are mild and temporary.  However, if you experience any serious or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention.

**Q: How should I store the Hepatitis A vaccine?**

A: Follow the storage instructions provided by your pharmacist or healthcare provider.  Vaccines must be stored properly to maintain their efficacy.

**Q:  Is it possible to get Hepatitis A after receiving the vaccine?**

A:  While the vaccine is highly effective, it is not 100% effective, meaning there is still a small chance of contracting Hepatitis A even after vaccination.  This is why maintaining good hygiene practices is important.
