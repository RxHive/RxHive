# Hydroxy Progesterone Caproate
### Generic Name
Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate

### Usage
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is primarily used to help prevent preterm birth in women who have previously experienced a spontaneous preterm delivery.  It's a synthetic form of progesterone, a hormone crucial for maintaining pregnancy.  Beyond its primary use in preventing preterm labor, it also has applications in treating certain conditions related to hormonal imbalances in women, such as:

*   **Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation):**  Both primary (never having menstruated) and secondary (menstruation ceasing after it has begun) amenorrhea can be addressed in some cases.
*   **Abnormal uterine bleeding:**  This medication can help regulate bleeding caused by hormonal imbalances, not by underlying medical conditions.
*   **Advanced uterine adenocarcinoma:** While less common, hydroxyprogesterone caproate is sometimes used in the treatment of advanced stages of this type of uterine cancer.
*   **Diagnostic testing:** It can be used as a test to determine whether a woman's body is producing estrogen.

It's crucial to remember that hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not a treatment for *active* preterm labor; it's preventative.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the condition being treated and the route of administration (intramuscular injection or subcutaneous injection).  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.

**Pregnancy (Preterm Birth Prevention):**

*   **Intramuscular (IM):** 250 mg once weekly (every 7 days), starting between 16 weeks 0 days and 20 weeks 6 days of gestation, and continuing until delivery or 37 weeks gestation (whichever comes first).
*   **Subcutaneous (SC - auto-injector):** 275 mg once weekly (every 7 days), following the same gestational timing as IM administration.

**Non-Pregnancy Indications:**  Dosage varies widely depending on the specific condition and the treatment approach (single dose, cyclic therapy).  Examples include:

*   **Amenorrhea/Abnormal Bleeding (single-dose therapy):** 375 mg as a single intramuscular injection.
*   **Amenorrhea/Abnormal Bleeding (cyclic therapy):** 250 mg intramuscularly on day 15 of each 28-day cycle for four cycles (often in combination with estradiol valerate).
*   **Advanced Uterine Adenocarcinoma:** 1000 mg or more per week, with the total weekly dose ranging from 1000 to 7000 mg.  Dosage and duration will be determined by the oncologist based on individual patient response.
*   **Endogenous Estrogen Production Test:** 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection; may be repeated after 4 weeks.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For preterm birth prevention in adolescents 16 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.  Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not typically used in children younger than 16.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

*   Pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Urticaria (hives)
*   Pruritus (itching)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy)
*   Gestational diabetes
*   Oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid)
*   Blood clots (thromboembolic events)
*   Allergic reactions

If you experience any significant or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is a synthetic progestin—a type of hormone similar to progesterone naturally produced in the body. While the precise mechanism for preventing preterm birth is not fully understood, it's believed to play a role in supporting the uterine lining and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. In the treatment of uterine adenocarcinoma, it may induce regressive changes in the cancerous tissue.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in women with known or suspected breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, liver disease, history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders, or allergy to the drug.  It should not be used to treat active preterm labor.
*   **Interactions:**  The metabolism of this drug can be affected by other medications, notably enzyme inducers like carbamazepine and phenytoin, potentially altering its effectiveness. It can also interact with ciclosporin. Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  While studies have not shown significant adverse effects on breastfeeding infants, caution is advised.
*   **Other Precautions:** Patients with conditions like asthma, migraine, epilepsy, heart or kidney problems should be closely monitored due to potential fluid retention.  Regular monitoring for signs of depression and blood clots is important.
