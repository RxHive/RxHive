# Hydrocodone + Phenyltoloxamine
### Generic Name
Hydrocodone + Phenyltoloxamine

### Usage

This combination medication is used to relieve severe, persistent coughs that don't respond to other cough suppressants.  It's primarily indicated for coughs associated with the common cold or upper respiratory allergies.  The hydrocodone component acts as a powerful cough suppressant (antitussive), while the phenyltoloxamine component is an antihistamine that helps to dry up secretions and potentially reduce some allergy-related symptoms.  It's important to note that this medication is not suitable for all coughs and should only be used as directed by a doctor.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Cough):**

* **Oral Suspension (Hydrocodone 5mg and Phenyltoloxamine 10mg per 5mL):**  The usual dose is 5 mL every 8-12 hours, not exceeding a total daily dose of 10 mL (Hydrocodone 10mg and Phenyltoloxamine 20mg). Treatment should not last longer than 7 days.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

This medication is not recommended for children under 18 years of age.

**Important Administration Notes:**  The oral suspension should be shaken well before each use.  Use a calibrated measuring device (like an oral syringe) to ensure accurate dosing.  Do not use household spoons for measurement.

### How it Works

Hydrocodone is an opioid that works by affecting the central nervous system (CNS). It reduces the cough reflex by acting on the brain's cough center. Phenyltoloxamine is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a substance released in the body during allergic reactions. By reducing histamine activity, phenyltoloxamine may help to dry up secretions and alleviate some allergy-related symptoms that may contribute to coughing. The combination of these two drugs provides a more comprehensive approach to cough suppression.
