# Herpes Zoster Vaccine Recombinant + Adjuvanted

**Generic Name:**  There isn't one single "generic" name for the recombinant, adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine.  Different manufacturers may have different brand names, but the active ingredient is generally described as a **recombinant zoster vaccine**.  For example, Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) is a specific brand name of this type of vaccine.

**Usage:**  The recombinant, adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine is used to prevent shingles (herpes zoster), a painful rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox.  It's recommended for adults aged 50 years and older, regardless of whether they had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine.  The CDC recommends a two-dose series for optimal protection.

**Side Effects:**  Common side effects include:

* Pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site.
* Headache
* Muscle pain
* Tiredness
* Fever
* Chills

Less common but more serious side effects are possible, although rare.  These should be reported to a doctor immediately.  These can include:

* Allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
* Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (a rare neurological disorder)
* Bell's palsy (facial paralysis)

**How it Works:** The vaccine contains a weakened (recombinant) form of the varicella-zoster virus. This recombinant protein stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that protect against shingles.  The adjuvant helps boost the immune response to the vaccine. Unlike some older vaccines, this one doesn't use a live virus.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is this vaccine effective?** A: Yes, clinical trials have shown it to be highly effective in preventing shingles and reducing the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a painful complication of shingles.
* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A:  Studies suggest protection lasts for at least 9 years, but longer-term effectiveness is still being studied.
* **Q: Can I get shingles even if I've had the vaccine?** A: While the vaccine is highly effective, it's not 100% effective.  A small percentage of vaccinated individuals may still develop shingles, but the severity is usually less.
* **Q:  Can I get the vaccine if I'm immunocompromised?** A:  Talk to your doctor.  The vaccine is generally well-tolerated, but individuals with severely compromised immune systems might have a reduced response.
* **Q: Can I get this vaccine if I've already had shingles?** A: Yes, but the benefits may be less pronounced than for those who haven't had shingles.  Your doctor can discuss this with you.
* **Q:  What is the difference between this vaccine and the older Zostavax vaccine?** A: The older Zostavax vaccine used a live-attenuated virus, while the recombinant, adjuvanted vaccine uses a recombinant protein.  The recombinant vaccine is generally considered more effective and better tolerated.
