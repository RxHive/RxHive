# Herpes Zoster Vaccine Recombinant + Adjuvanted
### Generic Name
Herpes Zoster Vaccine, Recombinant, Adjuvanted

### Usage

This vaccine is primarily used to prevent shingles (herpes zoster), a painful rash caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox.  The vaccine is particularly effective in reducing the incidence of shingles and its associated complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a persistent nerve pain that can last for months or even years after the shingles rash has healed.  While not directly treating existing shingles infections, it significantly lowers the risk of future occurrences.  


### Dosage

This vaccine is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).  

* **Adults 50 years and older:** The recommended dose is a single 0.65 mL injection.  A second dose may be recommended by a healthcare professional based on individual risk factors and the specific vaccine used.

* **Children:** This vaccine is not routinely recommended for children.  The use in children should only be considered under the specific guidance of a healthcare professional and typically only in cases of immunocompromised children at high risk of developing shingles.

There are no oral or other forms of this vaccine currently available.  Dosage adjustments based on weight or severity of the condition are not typically necessary.  Always follow the instructions provided by your healthcare provider or pharmacist.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of recipients) may include:

* Pain at the injection site
* Redness at the injection site
* Swelling at the injection site
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Muscle aches

Less common, but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention.  These may include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Bell's palsy (facial paralysis)
* Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (a rare neurological disorder)


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

The herpes zoster vaccine is a recombinant subunit vaccine.  This means it uses a weakened, non-infectious part of the varicella-zoster virus to stimulate an immune response. The vaccine introduces a specific viral protein (glycoprotein E) into the body, triggering the production of antibodies that target the virus.  These antibodies help prevent the reactivation of the latent VZV virus, thereby reducing the risk of developing shingles. The adjuvants in the vaccine enhance the immune response.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with a known severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including neomycin, should not receive it.
* **Immunocompromised individuals:** The vaccine's effectiveness may be reduced in individuals with weakened immune systems (e.g., due to HIV infection, chemotherapy, or other immunosuppressive therapies).  Consult a healthcare professional before vaccination.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe, it's advisable to discuss vaccination with a healthcare provider if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Interactions with other medications:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, as they may interact with the vaccine.

### FAQs

* **Q: How effective is the herpes zoster vaccine?**
    * A: The vaccine is highly effective in reducing the risk of shingles, typically by over 90% in adults 50 and older.  Its effectiveness in preventing PHN is also substantial.

* **Q: Can I get shingles even after receiving the vaccine?**
    * A: While the vaccine significantly reduces the risk, it does not offer 100% protection.  A small percentage of vaccinated individuals may still develop shingles, but typically with milder symptoms.

* **Q: How long does the vaccine protect for?**
    * A:  The duration of protection is not precisely known, but studies suggest it offers protection for many years.

* **Q: How should I store the vaccine?**
    * A: Follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.  Typically, the vaccine must be refrigerated.

* **Q: Is the vaccine safe for older adults?**
    * A:  The vaccine is generally safe and well-tolerated in older adults, who are the primary target population. However, potential side effects should be discussed with a healthcare provider.
