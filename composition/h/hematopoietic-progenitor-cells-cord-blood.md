# Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells, Cord Blood
### Generic Name
Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells, Cord Blood (HPC-CB)

### Usage
Hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) cord blood is used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  This means it's a treatment where healthy stem cells from a donor's umbilical cord blood are transplanted into a recipient to replace their damaged or diseased bone marrow.  It's primarily indicated for patients with various inherited, acquired, or treatment-induced disorders affecting the hematopoietic system (the system that makes blood cells). These disorders can include various cancers (leukemias, lymphomas), genetic blood disorders (like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia), and other conditions where the bone marrow is failing.


### Dosage
The recommended minimum dose for both adults and children is 2.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> nucleated cells/kg at cryopreservation.  This is the number of cells per kilogram of the recipient's body weight. Often, multiple units of cord blood are needed to achieve this dose.  The transplantation is administered intravenously (IV).

**Administration:**  The infusion typically begins slowly (100 mL/hr for adults, 1 mL/kg/hr for children) and is increased as tolerated. The rate may be reduced if the patient experiences fluid overload. The infusion should be stopped immediately if an allergic reaction or a moderate to severe infusion reaction occurs.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Sinus bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Acute Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) - a potentially life-threatening complication where the donor cells attack the recipient's body.
* Infusion reactions (allergic reactions or other adverse responses during infusion).
* Engraftment syndrome â€“ symptoms related to the new stem cells taking hold.
* Primary graft failure - the transplanted cells don't successfully take.

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine)
* Hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels)
* Allergic reactions

**Note:**  This is not an exhaustive list.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
HPC-CB contains hematopoietic stem cells. These are the body's building blocks for all blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Once infused, these stem cells migrate to the bone marrow, where they begin to multiply and differentiate into mature blood cells. This process helps restore normal blood cell counts and function, including immune function. In some cases of inherited metabolic disorders, the mature cells produced may also help to synthesize and circulate missing enzymes, improving some tissue functions.  However, the precise mechanism of action in all conditions is still being fully elucidated by ongoing research.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** HPC-CB is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dextran 40, or plasma proteins.

**Warnings:**

* **Fatal Infusion Reactions:**  Serious, even fatal, infusion reactions can occur. Close monitoring during and after infusion is essential.
* **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD):** GVHD is a significant risk, and can be fatal. Immunosuppressive therapy is often used to mitigate this risk.
* **Engraftment Syndrome:**  This syndrome can lead to multi-organ failure and death, requiring prompt treatment with corticosteroids.
* **Graft Failure:**  Failure of the transplanted cells to engraft (take hold) can be fatal. Close monitoring for hematopoietic recovery is crucial.  Pre-transplant HLA antibody testing is recommended to check for alloimmunization (the presence of antibodies against donor cells).
* **Infectious Disease Transmission:** There's a risk of transmitting infections from the donor to the recipient.  Rigorous screening of the donor cord blood is essential.
* **Rare Genetic Disease Transmission:** Although rare, there is a small chance of transmitting rare genetic diseases from the donor.

**Specific Populations:**

* **Pregnancy:** HPC-CB use during pregnancy should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  It is categorized as pregnancy category C.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether HPC-CB is excreted in breast milk. Use caution if breastfeeding.
* **Renal Impairment:**  The medication contains dextran 40, which is eliminated by the kidneys. Safety is not established in patients with renal insufficiency or failure.
* **Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for hepatic impairment.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is HPC-CB stored?** A: HPC-CB is cryopreserved (frozen) and stored at extremely low temperatures until use.  Specific storage requirements are provided by the manufacturer and should be strictly adhered to.

* **Q:  How long does the treatment take?** A:  The infusion itself can take several hours, depending on the dose and the patient's tolerance. The entire process, including preparation and post-transplant care, can extend over many days or weeks.

* **Q: What are the long-term effects?** A:  Long-term effects vary depending on the underlying condition being treated and the success of the transplant.  Some patients may experience long-term side effects related to the immunosuppressive therapies required to prevent GVHD or other complications. Regular monitoring and follow-up care are essential.

* **Q: Is it painful?** A: The infusion itself is usually not painful, though some patients may experience discomfort at the IV site.  Other side effects may cause pain or discomfort.

* **Q: What are the chances of success?** A:  Success rates vary depending on the recipient's age, underlying condition, donor-recipient match, and other factors. A healthcare professional can provide a more tailored assessment of the chances of success in a specific case.
