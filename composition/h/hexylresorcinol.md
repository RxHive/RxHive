# Hexylresorcinol
### Generic Name
Hexylresorcinol

### Usage
Hexylresorcinol is a versatile compound with antiseptic, local anesthetic, and anthelmintic (anti-worm) properties.  Its primary use is for the temporary relief of minor sore throat pain, mouth sores, and minor mouth irritation. It's also used as a first-aid antiseptic to help prevent infection in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.  While it has anthelmintic properties, its use for this purpose is largely outdated in modern medicine due to the availability of more effective and safer treatments.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Mouth/throat pain (Lozenge):**  One 2.4 mg lozenge every 2 hours as needed, not to exceed 10 lozenges per day.  For sore throat, use for a maximum of 2 days. For mouth sores, use for a maximum of 7 days. Discontinue use and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist, or if accompanied by fever, headache, rash, nausea, or vomiting.
* **Mouth/throat pain (0.1% solution):** Apply to the affected area or gargle and swish for one minute, then spit out. Use up to four times daily, or as directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Antisepsis (0.1% solution):** Apply a small amount to the affected area 1-3 times daily. Do not use for more than 7 days. Avoid large areas of skin, wounds, animal bites, burns, or the eyes.  Allow to dry before bandaging.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Mouth/throat pain (Lozenges & 0.1% solution):**  Use is generally the same as for adults, but lozenges are not recommended for children under 6 years old due to the risk of choking.  Always consult a healthcare professional before giving this medication to children.
* **Antisepsis (0.1% solution):**  Use is generally the same as for adults, but is not recommended for children under 2 years old. Consult a healthcare professional before use in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor before using this medication if you have liver or kidney disease.

**Important:** Stop using hexylresorcinol and seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

### How it Works

Hexylresorcinol works in two main ways:

1. **Antiseptic Action:** It disrupts the cell membranes and proteins of bacteria, leading to their death and preventing infection.
2. **Local Anesthetic Action:** It blocks the transmission of pain signals along nerve fibers by inhibiting the flow of sodium ions into nerve cells. This reduces pain sensation in the affected area.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hexylresorcinol is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to it.
* **Increased Risk:** There is an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria (hives), and angioedema (swelling of the face, neck, throat, or tongue).
* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in patients with fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption syndrome, or sucrase-isomaltose deficiency.  Caution is also advised in breastfeeding women as excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions exist with bupivacaine and methemoglobinemia-associated agents.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy:**  Hexylresorcinol is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  The potential benefits must be weighed against the potential risks before use during pregnancy.

### FAQs
