# Human Menopausal Gonadotrophin

**Generic Name:** Menotropins

**Usage:**

Menotropins (human menopausal gonadotropin, hMG) is a fertility medication used to stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple eggs.  Its primary uses include:

* **Ovulation induction in women with anovulation:**  For women who don't ovulate regularly due to various reasons, hMG helps induce ovulation.
* **Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in conjunction with other fertility treatments:**  Specifically in in-vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), and zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT).  It stimulates the growth of multiple follicles containing eggs for retrieval.
* **Treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism:** In some cases, it's used to stimulate sexual maturation in individuals with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a condition where the pituitary gland doesn't produce enough gonadotropins).


**Side Effects:**

Menotropins can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious:

**Common:**

* Ovarian enlargement (often asymptomatic but can be painful)
* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): This is a serious complication that can range from mild discomfort to life-threatening fluid imbalance. Symptoms can include abdominal bloating, pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight gain.  Severe OHSS requires immediate medical attention.
* Headaches
* Mood swings
* Breast tenderness
* Fatigue

**Serious (Less Common but Requiring Immediate Medical Attention):**

* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) - as detailed above.
* Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.):  This is a significant risk due to the multiple eggs stimulated.
* Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus).
* Thromboembolism (blood clots).
* Allergic reactions.


**How it Works:**

Menotropins is a mixture of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women.  These hormones are crucial for ovarian follicle development and maturation.  By administering menotropins, the medication mimics the natural hormonal signals that trigger egg development and ovulation.  This leads to the growth of multiple follicles containing mature eggs, ready for fertilization.


**FAQs:**

* **Is Menotropins safe?**  While generally safe when used under the supervision of a fertility specialist, Menotropins carries risks, particularly OHSS and multiple pregnancies.  Careful monitoring is essential.
* **How long does treatment last?** The duration of treatment varies depending on the individual and the specific protocol used.  It typically involves daily injections for several days to weeks.
* **What are the potential long-term effects?** Long-term effects are generally not expected, but the risk of OHSS and its potential complications remains a concern during and immediately following treatment.
* **Who should not use Menotropins?** Women with certain medical conditions such as ovarian cysts, tumors of the ovaries or pituitary gland, uncontrolled thyroid disorders, or a history of OHSS are generally not candidates for Menotropins.  Pregnancy should be excluded prior to initiating treatment.
* **Can I get pregnant without using Menotropins after treatment?**  In many cases, fertility may return to normal after treatment, though this isn't guaranteed.   Ovulation may still be irregular.
