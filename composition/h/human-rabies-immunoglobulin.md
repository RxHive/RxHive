# Human Rabies Immunoglobulin
### Generic Name
Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG)

### Usage
Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) is a passive immunization therapy used to prevent rabies after exposure to the rabies virus.  It's crucial in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), meaning it's administered *after* a potential rabies exposure, such as a bite or scratch from an animal suspected of having rabies.  HRIG doesn't cure rabies; instead, it provides immediate, temporary protection while the body's own immune response is stimulated by a rabies vaccine.  It's used in conjunction with the rabies vaccine series to maximize the chances of preventing the disease from developing.


### Dosage
Dosage of HRIG depends heavily on the severity and location of the exposure, the weight of the patient, and the type of HRIG product used.  Dosage instructions are always provided by the prescribing physician and are not standardized.  There isn't a separate adult and child dosage; rather, the dose is calculated based on the individual's weight and the specific circumstances.

* **Route of Administration:** HRIG is usually administered intramuscularly (IM) at the site of the bite wound whenever possible, to neutralize the virus locally.  If the wound is extensive or inaccessible, other intramuscular sites can be used.  Intravenous (IV) administration is generally avoided unless absolutely necessary due to the risk of allergic reactions.
* **Dosage Calculation:**  A health professional will determine the appropriate dose, typically based on the weight of the patient and the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific HRIG product. A portion of the total dose may be injected directly into or around the wound if medically feasible.
* **Forms:** HRIG is available in various vial strengths and presentations.

**It is absolutely vital that the dosage is determined and administered by a qualified healthcare professional experienced in rabies post-exposure prophylaxis.**  Self-medication or incorrect dosage is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of HRIG are generally mild and may include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Headache
* Mild fever
* Nausea
* Muscle aches

Less common, but more serious, side effects can include:

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to severe anaphylaxis â€“ a life-threatening allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention).
* Serum sickness (a delayed allergic reaction that can occur days after administration).

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a serious allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or hives.**


### How it Works
HRIG contains antibodies against the rabies virus. These antibodies are extracted from the blood of humans previously immunized against rabies. Once injected, these pre-formed antibodies immediately bind to and neutralize the rabies virus, preventing it from infecting nerve cells and spreading throughout the body. This provides immediate, albeit temporary, protection while the body develops its own immune response after receiving the rabies vaccine. This combined approach offers the best chance for preventing the development of rabies.


### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals with a history of allergic reactions to human immunoglobulins or other blood products should be carefully monitored.  A skin test may be performed before administration.
* **Kidney Problems:** HRIG can, in rare cases, put a strain on the kidneys. Individuals with pre-existing kidney conditions should be closely monitored.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  While generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the benefits of using HRIG to prevent rabies must be carefully weighed against potential risks by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:** There are no known significant interactions with other medications, but inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Storage:** HRIG must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is HRIG a vaccine?**  A: No, HRIG is not a vaccine.  It provides immediate, passive immunity, whereas vaccines stimulate the body to create its own long-term immunity.  HRIG is used *in conjunction* with the rabies vaccine series.

* **Q: How long does the protection from HRIG last?** A: The protection from HRIG is temporary, typically lasting only a few weeks.  This is why the rabies vaccine series is essential.

* **Q: What should I do if I think I've been exposed to rabies?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention.  Prompt treatment with HRIG and the rabies vaccine is crucial to prevent the development of rabies.  Thoroughly wash the wound with soap and water.

* **Q: Are there any alternative treatments to HRIG?** A:  No effective alternative exists for post-exposure rabies prophylaxis, and HRIG is a critical component of the standard treatment protocol.
