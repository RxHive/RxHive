# Human Rabies Immunoglobulin

**Generic Name:** Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG)

**Usage:**  HRIG is a passive immunotherapy used to prevent rabies infection after a possible exposure to the rabies virus.  It's administered in conjunction with the rabies vaccine.  It's crucial for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) because it provides immediate protection while the body builds immunity through vaccination. HRIG is most effective when administered as soon as possible after exposure.  Its use is dictated by the severity and location of the bite/exposure and the rabies status of the animal involved.

**Side Effects:** Side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Pain, swelling, redness, or itching at the injection site.
* Headache
* Fever
* Muscle aches
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Allergic reactions (rare, but can be severe, including anaphylaxis; therefore, careful monitoring is necessary).

Serious side effects are rare but possible.  Any serious symptoms should be reported immediately to a medical professional.

**How it Works:** HRIG contains rabies antibodies, which are proteins that specifically bind to and neutralize the rabies virus.  This directly protects against the virus before the body can mount its own immune response through vaccination.  The antibodies in HRIG are derived from the plasma of human donors who have high levels of rabies antibodies, usually after vaccination.  The antibodies bind to the virus, preventing it from infecting nerve cells and spreading throughout the body.

**FAQs:**

* **Q: Is HRIG a vaccine?** A: No, HRIG is not a vaccine.  It provides passive immunity (pre-made antibodies) while the rabies vaccine works by stimulating the body to produce its own antibodies (active immunity). Both are needed for optimal protection after exposure.

* **Q: How is HRIG administered?** A: HRIG is usually administered by injection, often infiltrated around the wound to maximize neutralization of the virus near the site of entry.  It may also be given intramuscularly.

* **Q: How long does HRIG protection last?** A: The protection provided by HRIG is temporary, lasting only a few weeks.  The rabies vaccine provides long-term protection.

* **Q: Who should receive HRIG?** A: Individuals at risk of rabies infection, especially those exposed to the saliva of a potentially rabid animal through a bite, scratch, or contact with mucous membranes, should receive HRIG as part of PEP.  The decision to administer HRIG is made by a healthcare professional based on the specifics of the exposure.

* **Q: Are there any contraindications to HRIG?** A:  There are limited contraindications, however, severe allergic reactions to human plasma products would be a contraindication. A thorough allergy history must be taken before administration.

* **Q: What are the risks associated with HRIG?** A: While generally safe, HRIG carries a risk of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.  Other side effects are generally mild and transient.  The benefits of preventing rabies infection far outweigh the risks associated with HRIG administration.
