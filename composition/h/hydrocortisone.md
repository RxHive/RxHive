# Hydrocortisone

**Generic Name:** Hydrocortisone

**Usage:** Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid used to treat a variety of inflammatory and allergic conditions.  Its usage depends on the formulation (cream, ointment, tablet, injection):

* **Topical (creams, ointments, lotions):**  Treats skin conditions like eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis, insect bites, and allergic reactions.
* **Oral (tablets, liquids):** Treats inflammatory conditions such as allergic reactions, inflammatory bowel disease (in some cases), autoimmune diseases (in some cases), and certain types of adrenal insufficiency.  It can also be used for short-term treatment of severe allergic reactions.
* **Injection (intra-articular, intravenous):** Treats inflammation in joints (arthritis), and in severe cases of allergic reactions or adrenal insufficiency.  Intravenous administration is typically reserved for critical situations.
* **Suppositories/Enemas:** Used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, particularly proctitis (inflammation of the rectum).


**Side Effects:** Side effects vary depending on the dosage, formulation, and duration of use.

* **Topical:** Burning, itching, dryness, skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), increased risk of infection. Prolonged use can lead to skin atrophy.
* **Oral:** Increased appetite, weight gain, fluid retention, high blood pressure, mood changes, insomnia, increased risk of infections, cataracts, glaucoma, osteoporosis, thinning skin.
* **Injection:** Similar to oral side effects, but potentially more severe and rapid onset, depending on the injection site and dose.


**How it Works:** Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid, a type of steroid hormone. It works by binding to receptors inside cells, reducing the activity of inflammatory cells and reducing the production of substances that cause inflammation and allergic reactions.  This leads to decreased swelling, redness, itching, and pain.  In some cases, it may suppress the immune system.

**FAQs:**

* **Is hydrocortisone addictive?**  No, hydrocortisone is not addictive in the same way as opioids. However, prolonged use, especially high doses of oral or injectable hydrocortisone, can lead to dependence, and sudden cessation after long-term use can cause withdrawal symptoms.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.
* **Can I use hydrocortisone long-term?** Long-term use of hydrocortisone, especially oral or injectable formulations, should be avoided whenever possible due to the potential for serious side effects.  Topical hydrocortisone is generally safer for longer-term use, but it should still be used as directed by a doctor.
* **Can I use hydrocortisone on my face?** Topical hydrocortisone can be used on the face, but it's best to use a low-potency formulation and apply it sparingly to avoid skin thinning and other side effects.
* **Can I use hydrocortisone during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor before using hydrocortisone during pregnancy or breastfeeding. While generally considered safe in moderation, there are potential risks.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** If you miss a dose of oral hydrocortisone, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.  For topical applications, simply apply the next dose as scheduled.
* **What are the symptoms of a hydrocortisone overdose?** Symptoms of an overdose can include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, high blood pressure, and increased blood sugar. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose.
