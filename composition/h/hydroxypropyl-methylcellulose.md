# Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose
### Generic Name
Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (Hypromellose)

### Usage
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hypromellose) is primarily used as an artificial tear replacement for the treatment of dry eye disease and for the temporary relief of discomfort from minor eye irritations (e.g., wind, sun exposure).  It provides lubrication and protection to the eye's surface.  Beyond its use in treating dry eyes, hypromellose also finds application in ophthalmic procedures.  Specifically, it serves as a viscoelastic agent during various anterior segment surgeries, such as cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation, helping to maintain the shape of the eye during the procedure.  It's also used as a diagnostic aid in gonioscopy (examination of the drainage angle of the eye).

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation (solution or gel), concentration, and intended use.  Always follow the instructions provided on the product labeling.

**For dry eye treatment:**  The typical dose is 1-2 drops of a 0.3% to 2.5% solution or gel instilled into the affected eye(s) three to four times daily (TID or QID) or as needed.

**For gonioscopy:** A 2.5% solution is used as needed during the procedure.  For surgical use as an intraocular irrigating solution, a 2% solution is employed according to the surgeon's technique.

**For ophthalmic surgery:**  The dosage and administration method will be determined by the ophthalmologist during the procedure; consult specific product instructions.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  For dry eye treatment in children, the dosage is generally the same as for adults (using a 0.3% solution), but always consult a pediatrician or ophthalmologist before using it in children.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are generally mild and may include:

* Mild stinging or burning sensation
* Blurred vision (temporary)
* Eye irritation
* Foreign body sensation
* Redness (ocular hyperemia)

Less common, but more serious side effects, such as a transient increase in intraocular pressure after surgery, can occur.  If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is a cellulose derivative that acts as a lubricant and moisture-retaining agent. When applied to the eye, it forms a protective layer over the surface, preventing moisture evaporation and providing relief from dryness and irritation. In surgical settings, its viscoelastic properties help maintain the eye's structure during procedures, allowing for more precise and efficient manipulation of tissues.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Hypromellose is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to hypromellose or any of its components.  For the 2.5% solution specifically, it is contraindicated with hot laser treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions have been reported, however, always inform your doctor or ophthalmologist of all medications you are currently using, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.
* **Warnings:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes undergoing vitrectomy.  Increased risk of intraoperative lens changes has been noted.  Pregnancy Category C:  The safety of hypromellose during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established. Consult with your healthcare provider before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **General Precautions:**  This medication is for ophthalmic use only. Avoid touching the tip of the container to the eye or any other surface.  Do not share the medication with others.

### FAQs
* **Q: How long can I use hypromellose for dry eyes before seeking medical attention?**
   * **A:** If you are using hypromellose to self-treat dry eyes, and your symptoms persist or worsen after 72 hours (3 days), or if you experience any eye pain, vision changes, or increased redness, discontinue use and consult an eye doctor.

* **Q: Can I wear contact lenses while using hypromellose?**
   * **A:** Remove contact lenses before applying hypromellose eye drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.

* **Q: How should I store hypromellose eye drops?**
   * **A:** Store according to the instructions on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from direct light and heat.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects associated with hypromellose use?**
   * **A:**  Long-term use of hypromellose in the recommended dosages is generally considered safe. However, itâ€™s always best to discuss any concerns about long-term use with your eye doctor.
