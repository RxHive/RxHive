# Human insulin
### Generic Name
Human Insulin

### Usage
Human insulin is a hormone used to manage high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes mellitus.  Its primary use is to replace the insulin the body no longer produces or doesn't produce enough of, allowing for proper glucose metabolism.  This is crucial for preventing the complications associated with uncontrolled diabetes, such as nerve damage (neuropathy), kidney damage (nephropathy), eye damage (retinopathy), and cardiovascular disease.  Different types of human insulin preparations are available, offering varying onset and duration of action to better match individual needs and lifestyles.  While primarily used for type 1 diabetes, where the body produces no insulin, it's also used in type 2 diabetes when oral medications and lifestyle changes are insufficient to control blood sugar.

### Dosage
Insulin dosage is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the type of diabetes, the patient's age, weight, activity level, diet, and overall health.  It is determined by a healthcare professional through regular blood glucose monitoring and adjustments based on results.  There's no single "correct" dosage.

* **Oral:** Human insulin is not available in oral form because it would be broken down in the digestive system before reaching the bloodstream.
* **IV (Intravenous):** Human insulin can be administered intravenously, usually in a hospital setting, for rapid blood sugar control during emergencies such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  The dosage is determined by the healthcare provider based on the patient's condition and response.
* **Subcutaneous Injection:** This is the most common route of administration.  Different types of human insulin (regular, NPH, and long-acting) have varying onset and duration of action, necessitating different injection schedules.  Dosage is measured in units, and the amount injected may range from a few units to several hundred, depending on the individual's needs.  Children require smaller doses, adjusted according to their weight and metabolic needs.  Precise dosing instructions are provided by the healthcare team.

### Side Effects
* **Common:** Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar – symptoms include dizziness, sweating, shakiness, confusion), weight gain.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Severe hypoglycemia (leading to loss of consciousness or seizures), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), lipohypertrophy (thickening of fatty tissue at the injection site).

It is crucial to promptly contact a healthcare professional if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works
Human insulin mimics the action of naturally produced insulin.  It binds to insulin receptors on cells, facilitating the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into cells. This lowers blood glucose levels.  The different types of insulin preparations vary in how quickly they begin working and how long their effects last, affecting glucose control throughout the day.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Human insulin is generally safe for use in patients with diabetes, but it is contraindicated in those with a severe allergy to insulin or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Certain medications, such as some oral hypoglycemic agents, beta-blockers, and corticosteroids, can affect insulin requirements.  It’s crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Insulin use is generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary because insulin needs may change during these periods.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults might require dose adjustments due to changes in kidney or liver function.
* **Children:** Pediatric dosing is different, adjusted according to weight and maturity.

Always consult a healthcare professional before starting or changing your insulin regimen.


### FAQs
* **Q: How do I store insulin?** A:  Store unopened insulin vials in the refrigerator.  Once opened, it can be stored at room temperature for a certain period (depending on the type of insulin), and should be protected from extreme temperatures and direct sunlight. Always refer to the product's labeling for specific storage instructions.
* **Q: What should I do if I have low blood sugar?** A:  Consume a fast-acting carbohydrate source (like glucose tablets or juice) immediately. Recheck your blood sugar levels after 15 minutes. If symptoms persist, seek medical attention.
* **Q: Can I miss a dose of insulin?** A:  No, missing a dose can lead to dangerously high blood sugar levels.  If you miss a dose, consult your healthcare provider as soon as possible.
* **Q: What are the long-term effects of using insulin?** A:  While insulin helps manage diabetes, long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, and kidney damage are still possible if blood sugar is not well controlled.  Maintaining good blood sugar control through appropriate insulin therapy, diet, and lifestyle is crucial for reducing these risks.
* **Q:  Are there different types of human insulin?** A: Yes, there are different types of human insulin with varying onset and duration of action to suit different treatment needs and lifestyles (e.g., regular, NPH, long-acting).  Your doctor will determine the best type for you.
