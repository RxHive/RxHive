# Human insulin

**Generic Name:** Insulin human (rDNA origin)  *(Note:  There are many manufacturers of generic human insulin, so this is a general name.)*

**Usage:**

* **Treatment of diabetes mellitus:**  Insulin human is used to manage type 1 diabetes and some forms of type 2 diabetes where the body doesn't produce enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it produces.  It helps regulate blood sugar levels by enabling glucose to enter cells for energy.
* **Other uses:** It may be used in other specific situations under a doctor's supervision, such as during surgery or critical illness to control blood glucose.

**Side Effects:**

Side effects vary depending on the individual, the dose, and the method of administration. Common side effects include:

* **Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar):** This is the most serious side effect and can cause symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion, rapid heartbeat, and even loss of consciousness.
* **Injection site reactions:** Redness, swelling, itching, or pain at the injection site are common.
* **Weight gain:** Insulin can cause weight gain in some individuals.
* **Lipohypertrophy (fat buildup):** This can occur at the injection site with repeated injections in the same area.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but can range from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).

Less common side effects include edema (swelling), visual disturbances, and changes in potassium levels.


**How it Works:**

Human insulin is a hormone produced through recombinant DNA technology (rDNA). It's identical to the insulin your pancreas produces naturally.  It works by binding to insulin receptors on the surface of cells, allowing glucose (sugar) to move from the bloodstream into the cells where it can be used for energy. This lowers blood sugar levels.


**FAQs:**

* **How is it administered?**  Human insulin is typically injected subcutaneously (under the skin) using a syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump.  Intravenous administration may be used in certain hospital settings.
* **What are the different types of human insulin?** While this entry focuses on *regular* human insulin (short-acting), other forms of insulin exist (e.g., NPH, which is intermediate-acting). Different types have varying onset and duration of action.  Your doctor will determine the most appropriate type and dosage for your needs.
* **How do I store it?**  Insulin should be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually refrigerated (but not frozen). Unopened vials may have longer storage times than opened vials.
* **Can I mix different types of insulin?**  Mixing insulins is sometimes done, but it should *only* be done under the direction of your doctor or diabetes educator.
* **What should I do if I experience low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?**  If you experience symptoms of low blood sugar, quickly consume a fast-acting carbohydrate source (like glucose tablets or juice) and then follow your doctor's instructions for managing hypoglycemia.  Severe hypoglycemia requires immediate medical attention.
* **Can I take it if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?** This should be discussed with your doctor. Insulin use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is often necessary to maintain blood glucose control.
* **How do I know if my insulin is still good?** Check the expiration date on the vial or pen.  Also, be aware of any changes in appearance (cloudy, discolored).
