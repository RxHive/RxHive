# Hemocoagulase
### Generic Name
Hemocoagulase

### Usage
Hemocoagulase is a hemostatic agent used to manage bleeding.  Its primary use is to control hemorrhage from various sources, including pulmonary (lung), oral (mouth), genital, and wound bleeding.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is used to *control* bleeding, not to treat the underlying cause of the bleeding.  The underlying cause must be addressed by a physician.

### Dosage
**Adults:** For bleeding, the typical dosage is 1-2 Klobusitzky units (KU) daily, administered either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).

**Children (Infants, Children, and Adolescents):** For bleeding, the typical dosage is 0.3-1 Klobusitzky unit (KU) daily, administered either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).

**Dosage Adjustments:** The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these cases.  Dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the severity of bleeding and the patient's overall health. IV administration should be slow.


### Side Effects
* **Common:** Injection site pruritus (itching) and rash. Induration (hardening) at the injection site.
* **Less Common but Serious:** Shock, hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions). Infusion reactions (nausea, chest discomfort, palpitation, temporary burning sensation, and headache) can occur with IV administration.

**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially serious ones, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Hemocoagulase is derived from the venom of the *Bothrops atrox* snake.  It contains purified enzymes that work by accelerating the blood clotting process.  Specifically, it increases the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and fibrinogen to fibrin, key components in blood clot formation. This action shortens clotting time and helps to stop bleeding.


### Precautions
**Contraindications (When Hemocoagulase Should NOT Be Used):**

* Hypersensitivity (allergy) to hemocoagulase or any of its components.
* Patients with a history of or active arterial thrombotic disorders (such as cerebral thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and thrombophlebitis).
* Concurrent use with thrombin.
* Any existing coagulation disorders.

**Warnings and Precautions:**

* Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion reactions.
* Use with caution in elderly patients.  Always consult your physician before using this medication.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:** Hemocoagulase is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there is no adequate data in pregnant women.  The excretion of hemocoagulase in breast milk is unknown.  A healthcare professional should carefully assess the risks and benefits before prescribing hemocoagulase to pregnant or breastfeeding women.


### FAQs
