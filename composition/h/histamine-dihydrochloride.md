# Histamine Dihydrochloride
### Generic Name
Histamine Dihydrochloride

### Usage

Histamine dihydrochloride has two primary uses:

1. **Topical Analgesic:** It's used for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains in muscles and joints.  This includes conditions like arthritis, simple backaches, strains, and bruises.  The medication works by causing vasodilation at the application site, increasing blood flow to promote healing.

2. **Adjunctive Therapy in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):** In combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2), histamine dihydrochloride is used as maintenance therapy for adult AML patients in first remission.  It plays a role in supporting the immune system's ability to target and destroy remaining leukemia cells. This use is significantly more complex and requires close medical supervision.


### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the intended use:

**Topical Application (for muscle and joint pain):**

* **Cream (0.03%):** Apply a thin layer to the affected area and gently massage until absorbed.  Apply three to four times daily (TID or QID).  Discontinue use if symptoms worsen, persist for more than 7 days, or clear up and then reappear within a few days. The maximum recommended dose is four applications per day.

**Subcutaneous Injection (for AML maintenance therapy):**

This is *only* used in conjunction with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and requires strict adherence to a physician-prescribed regimen. A typical regimen involves:

* Administering IL-2 (16400 IU/kg or 1 µg/kg) subcutaneously twice daily.
* Administering 0.5 mL of histamine dihydrochloride solution subcutaneously 1–3 minutes *after* each IL-2 injection.
* Injecting the histamine dihydrochloride slowly over 5–15 minutes.
* Following a specific treatment schedule of 21-day cycles with varying rest periods between cycles (consult physician for details).


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of histamine dihydrochloride have not been established in children.

### Side Effects

* **Common:** Rash, headache, nausea, vomiting.
* **Serious (less common):**  While less frequent, serious side effects are possible, especially with the injectable form used in AML treatment.  Always report any concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

* **Topical Use:** Histamine dihydrochloride causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) at the application site, increasing blood flow to the area. This increased blood flow helps to deliver nutrients and remove waste products, potentially accelerating the healing process.

* **AML Treatment:** In AML treatment, histamine dihydrochloride works synergistically with IL-2 to enhance the body's immune response against leukemia cells.  Histamine dihydrochloride appears to protect and support the activity of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, which are critical for eliminating cancerous cells. IL-2 stimulates the proliferation and activity of these immune cells.



### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Histamine dihydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, significantly compromised cardiac function, those receiving systemic steroids, clonidine or H2 blockers, those who have received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women.

* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, peptic or esophageal ulcer disease (with a history of bleeding), a history of autoimmune disease, poorly compensated cardiac function, or renal impairment.

* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers and other anti-hypertensive agents should be used cautiously. Concurrent use with medications that have cardiotoxicity or blood pressure-lowering effects may increase the risk of adverse effects. H1 receptor-blocking antihistamines, neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, anti-malarials, and anti-trypanosomal agents may interact and should be used with caution or avoided.


* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Histamine dihydrochloride, particularly in conjunction with IL-2 for AML treatment, is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Effective contraception is essential during treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this cream for any type of pain?** A: No, it's only for temporary relief of minor muscle and joint aches and pains.  For severe or persistent pain, consult a doctor.

* **Q: How should I store Histamine Dihydrochloride?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the product label.  Generally, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, to your healthcare provider immediately.

* **Q: Is it safe to use this medication with other drugs?** A:  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications and supplements you are taking to avoid potential interactions.

* **Q:  How long will it take to see results?** A: The onset of action and duration of relief vary depending on the use and individual factors.  For topical use, some relief may be experienced relatively quickly, while for AML therapy, effects are more gradual and related to overall treatment success.
