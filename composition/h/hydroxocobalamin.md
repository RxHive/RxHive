# Hydroxocobalamin
### Generic Name
Hydroxocobalamin

### Usage

Hydroxocobalamin, also known as vitamin B12a or hydroxycobalamin, is a water-soluble form of vitamin B12.  Its primary use is as an antidote for cyanide poisoning, whether known or suspected. This is a life-threatening condition, and prompt treatment is crucial.  

Beyond cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin is used to treat pernicious anemia, a condition where the body can't absorb vitamin B12 properly.  It's also employed to address vitamin B12 deficiency stemming from various causes, including dietary insufficiency, malabsorption syndromes (like Crohn's disease or celiac disease), insufficient intrinsic factor secretion (necessary for B12 absorption), competition for B12 by intestinal parasites or bacteria, or impaired B12 utilization (sometimes seen during cancer treatment).


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.

**Cyanide Poisoning (Adult):** Intravenous (IV) administration is typically used.  The initial dose is generally 5 grams as a single infusion. A second 5-gram dose may be given depending on the severity and response, with a maximum cumulative dose of 10 grams.  Immediate treatment is essential in suspected cases.

**Cyanide Poisoning (Pediatric):** Intravenous (IV) or intraosseous administration is used. The dose is 70 mg/kg as a single infusion, with a maximum dose of 5000 mg per dose.  A second dose may be given based on the severity and response, up to a maximum of 5000 mg. Immediate treatment is vital.

**Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Adult):** Intramuscular (IM) injection is the usual route. For mild deficiencies, 1000 mcg once weekly is common, sometimes up to three times weekly until levels are corrected, followed by maintenance doses (1000 mcg every other month or longer intervals).  Severe deficiencies may require 1000 mcg every other day for up to three weeks, followed by maintenance.

**Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Pediatric):**  Dosage is highly variable depending on the severity and cause of the deficiency.  It ranges from 50-100 mcg in infants to 250-1000 mcg in older children, adjusted by the healthcare provider.  The route is generally IM.


**Important Note:**  The above is a simplified representation of dosing guidelines.  Healthcare professionals will determine the appropriate dose based on individual patient needs and the specific condition.  Dosage instructions for other conditions (e.g. vasoplegic syndrome, an off-label use)  should be obtained from the treating physician.



### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Frequency varies depending on the route and dose):**

* Pain at the injection site (IM)
* Diarrhea
* Skin rash or itching
* Nausea
* Headache

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Increased blood pressure
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Urine discoloration (can persist for several weeks)
* Renal issues (including kidney stones and acute kidney injury)
* Swelling

If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or other healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

In cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin works by binding to cyanide ions in the bloodstream, forming cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12). This less toxic compound is then excreted in the urine, effectively removing the cyanide from the body.  

In the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency, hydroxocobalamin acts as a direct replacement for the missing vitamin.  Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in various metabolic processes, including DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nerve function. By replenishing B12 levels, hydroxocobalamin helps correct the deficiencies and alleviate symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Hydroxocobalamin should not be used in individuals with a known allergy to the medication or its components.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use caution in patients with kidney problems, as hydroxocobalamin can impact kidney function, potentially leading to kidney stones or acute kidney injury.  It may also interfere with some dialysis machines.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe for vitamin B12 deficiency treatment, its use during pregnancy or breastfeeding for cyanide poisoning or other conditions needs careful consideration and should be guided by a physician.  Breastfeeding is usually advised against during treatment of cyanide poisoning.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Hydroxocobalamin may interact with certain medications, such as chloramphenicol (an antibiotic) and arsenic trioxide (a cancer drug). Consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking.
* **Folic Acid Deficiency:**  Hydroxocobalamin should be used cautiously in individuals with folic acid deficiency as it can mask the underlying condition.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: This varies greatly depending on the condition and the severity. In cyanide poisoning, effects are seen relatively quickly; for vitamin B12 deficiency, it may take weeks to months for significant improvement.

* **Q: How is hydroxocobalamin stored?** A: Store as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist.  Generally, it should be protected from light and kept at room temperature.

* **Q: Can I stop taking hydroxocobalamin when I feel better?** A: No.  Continue taking it as prescribed by your doctor even if you feel better.  Stopping prematurely could lead to recurrence of symptoms or complications.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance on missed doses.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Is hydroxocobalamin safe for children?** A: Yes, but the dosage must be adjusted based on the child's age, weight, and the condition being treated.  Always follow the specific instructions from a pediatrician or other qualified healthcare provider.
