### Generic Name
Hamycin

### Usage
Hamycin is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat vaginal infections.  It's a topical treatment, meaning it's applied directly to the affected area. While its primary use is in vaginal infections,  information regarding other potential uses is limited in readily available resources.

### Dosage
Dosage information for Hamycin is primarily available for vaginal infections:

* **Vaginal Infections:**  The typical dosage involves applying a suspension containing 2 lakh units per milliliter (200,000 units/mL) to the affected area.  The frequency of application is usually twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) for a duration of 7 to 10 days.  This should be done using sterile cotton.

Serious side effects are not commonly reported but should be reported to a doctor immediately. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects after using Hamycin, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
The precise mechanism of action of Hamycin is not fully understood.  However, it's believed that it might exert its antifungal effects through a process involving phagocytosis (where immune cells engulf and destroy the fungus).  Further research is needed to clarify its complete mode of action.
