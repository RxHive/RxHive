# Hydrocortisone + Fusidic Acid
### Generic Name
Hydrocortisone + Fusidic Acid

### Usage

Hydrocortisone and Fusidic Acid is a combination topical medication used to treat inflammatory skin conditions, primarily those involving bacterial infection.  Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation and itching. Fusidic acid, an antibiotic, combats bacterial infection.  This combination is particularly effective for conditions where both inflammation and bacterial infection are present, such as:

* **Infected eczema:**  Eczema (atopic dermatitis) often becomes infected by bacteria, leading to increased inflammation, pus, and crusting. This combination addresses both the infection and the inflammation.
* **Infected psoriasis:** Similar to eczema, psoriasis can also be complicated by bacterial infection, making this combination therapy a suitable option.
* **Impetigo:** This bacterial skin infection, characterized by blisters and crusts, often benefits from the combined anti-inflammatory and antibacterial action.
* **Other infected skin conditions:** This medication may be prescribed for various other skin conditions complicated by bacterial infection, as determined by a healthcare professional.

It's crucial to understand that this medication is for topical use only and is not intended for systemic treatment of infections.  It should not be used to treat deep or widespread infections.


### Dosage

Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation (cream, ointment), the affected area, and the severity of the condition.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions carefully.  Generally:

* **Adults and Children:** A thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected area twice daily.  The frequency and duration of treatment will be determined by your healthcare provider.
* **Oral & IV Administration:** This medication is for topical use only and is not available in oral or intravenous forms.

**Important Note:**  Do not exceed the prescribed dosage or duration of treatment.  Improper use can lead to undesirable side effects or resistance to the antibiotics. Always seek professional advice before applying this medication to extensive areas of the body or to sensitive areas like the face or genitals.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are usually mild and include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Itching
* Dryness or redness of the skin
* Skin thinning (with prolonged use)
* Skin discoloration (with prolonged use)

Less common but more serious side effects, requiring immediate medical attention, include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Worsening of the skin condition
* Secondary infection
* Systemic absorption of corticosteroids (with prolonged or extensive use), leading to symptoms such as fluid retention, increased blood sugar levels, or changes in mood.


### How it Works

Hydrocortisone works by suppressing the immune system's inflammatory response in the skin. It reduces the production of inflammatory chemicals, leading to decreased swelling, redness, itching, and pain. Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, effectively preventing bacterial growth and multiplication. The combination addresses both the inflammation and the infection, promoting faster healing and reducing the risk of complications.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used if you have a known allergy to hydrocortisone, fusidic acid, or any of its ingredients.
* **Drug Interactions:** There are limited documented drug interactions. However, always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies, you are currently using.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Consult with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.
* **Elderly:**  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects.  Close monitoring is advisable.
* **Extended Use:** Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can cause skin thinning and other adverse effects.  Do not use it for longer than prescribed.
