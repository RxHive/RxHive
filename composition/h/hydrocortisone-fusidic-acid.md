# Hydrocortisone + Fusidic Acid

**Generic Name:** Hydrocortisone + Fusidic Acid

**Usage:** This combination cream or ointment is used to treat a variety of skin conditions involving inflammation and bacterial infection.  It's commonly prescribed for:

* **Eczema (with secondary infection):**  Where eczema has become infected with bacteria.
* **Impetigo:** A highly contagious bacterial skin infection.
* **Psoriasis (with secondary infection):** Similar to eczema, this is used when psoriasis has a bacterial infection.
* **Other inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial infection:**  The doctor will determine if this is an appropriate treatment based on the specific condition.

**Important Note:** This medication should only be used for a short period as directed by a doctor.  Prolonged use can lead to side effects and potentially worsen the condition. It is not suitable for all skin conditions and shouldn't be used for viral or fungal infections.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are relatively uncommon but can include:

* **Skin irritation:** Burning, itching, dryness, redness, or rash at the application site.
* **Skin thinning (skin atrophy):** With prolonged use, especially in sensitive areas or on the face.
* **Striae (stretch marks):**  Especially with prolonged use.
* **Increased risk of infection:** While treating an infection, prolonged use can suppress the immune system locally, making the skin more vulnerable to other infections.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rare but possible. Symptoms may include swelling, hives, or difficulty breathing.

**How it Works:**

This combination medication contains two active ingredients:

* **Hydrocortisone:** A corticosteroid (a type of steroid) that reduces inflammation and itching. It works by suppressing the immune system locally, thereby reducing the inflammatory response.
* **Fusidic Acid:** An antibiotic that kills bacteria responsible for the infection. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial growth and multiplication.

The combination provides both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial action, making it effective against inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial infection.
