# Hetastarch/ Lactated Electrolyte Solution
### Generic Name
Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution

### Usage
Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution primarily used in the treatment of hypovolemia (low blood volume) associated with sepsis and septic shock.  It works by expanding the plasma volume, helping to restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion.  While its primary use is in treating these severe conditions, it's important to note that its use should be guided by a healthcare professional due to potential risks.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For hypovolemia, the intravenous (IV) dosage ranges from 500 mL to 1000 mL.  The total dose and infusion rate depend heavily on the amount of blood loss and the resulting hemoconcentration.  Precise administration is determined by the severity of the condition and the patient's response, requiring close monitoring by a healthcare professional.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution have not been established in children.  It should not be used in pediatric populations.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 10 mL/min), the initial dose may not require adjustment, however subsequent doses should be reduced by 20% to 50% of the normal requirement.  There are no specific dosage adjustments provided by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic impairment.


### Side Effects
* **Frequency Unknown:** Cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypotension, peripheral edema, ventricular fibrillation, urticaria (hives), rash, pruritus (itching), metabolic acidosis, vomiting, parotid gland hypertrophy, hemolysis (red blood cell destruction), hemorrhage, and hepatotoxicity (liver damage).

It's crucial to report any adverse effects to a healthcare professional immediately.  The list above does not encompass all possible side effects.

### How it Works
Hetastarch is a colloid, a type of large molecule that remains within the bloodstream, drawing fluid from the tissues into the blood vessels. This increases the plasma volume, thereby improving blood pressure and tissue perfusionâ€”the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues.  The lactated electrolyte solution component helps to replenish essential electrolytes lost during conditions like sepsis. The hydroxyethyl ether groups on the hetastarch molecule reduce its metabolism rate, prolonging its effects.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to hetastarch or its components; pre-existing bleeding or coagulation disorders; clinical conditions where volume overload is a significant concern;  critically ill adults (due to increased risk of death and severe renal injury); lactic acidosis; or hypersensitivity to hetastarch.

**Warnings:** Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is essential.  Patients should be observed for signs of volume overload (e.g., edema, shortness of breath).  This medication should be used with extreme caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  The use of Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution in pregnancy falls under pregnancy category C; meaning its effects on the fetus are unknown.  Its excretion in breast milk is also uncertain; use with caution during lactation.


### FAQs

**Q: How is Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution stored?**
A:  Storage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation and manufacturer. Refer to the product label for detailed storage guidance.


**Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?**
A:  Stop using the medication and immediately consult a doctor or other healthcare professional.


**Q: Can I take other medications with Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution?**
A:  Always inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, you are currently taking.  Interactions with other drugs are possible.


**Q: Is Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution safe for long-term use?**
A:  Hetastarch/Lactated Electrolyte Solution is not typically intended for long-term use and is primarily administered acutely to manage severe hypovolemia associated with specific conditions. The duration of treatment should be guided by a healthcare professional.
