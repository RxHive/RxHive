# Hydrochloride
Please note that "Hydrochloride" is not a medicine itself but a salt form frequently used in pharmaceuticals.  Many medications contain hydrochloride as a salt to improve their stability, solubility, or bioavailability.  To provide you with the information you requested, I need the name of the specific medication containing Hydrochloride.  For example,  "Metoprolol Hydrochloride" or "Amoxicillin Hydrochloride."  Please provide the full name of the drug you are interested in.
