# Hydrochloride

It's impossible to provide details about "generic Hydrochloride" because hydrochloride is not a drug itself, but rather a salt form of a drug.  Many medications exist as hydrochloride salts.  The hydrochloride part simply means the drug has been combined with hydrochloric acid to make it more stable, soluble, and easier to formulate into pills or other medications.

To give you useful information, I need to know the *specific* drug you're interested in.  For example, you might be thinking of:

* **Amlodipine Hydrochloride:** Used to treat high blood pressure.
* **Lisinopril Hydrochloride:** Used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.
* **Metoprolol Hydrochloride:** Used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure.
* **Citalopram Hydrochloride:** Used to treat depression.

Once you specify the drug, I can provide details on its usage, side effects, mechanism of action, and FAQs.
