# HUMAN PREMIX

There is no medication officially called "HUMAN PREMIX."  The term suggests a mixture of human-derived substances, which is not a standard pharmaceutical naming convention.  Therefore, I cannot provide details about a generic "HUMAN PREMIX."  To get information about a specific medication, please provide the actual name of the drug or a more precise description of its contents.
