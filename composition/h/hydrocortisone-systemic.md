# Hydrocortisone (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Hydrocortisone (Systemic)

### Usage

Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid hormone that mimics the body's natural cortisol.  It's used to treat a wide range of conditions involving inflammation and immune system suppression. Its primary use is in replacing cortisol when the body doesn't produce enough (adrenal insufficiency).  This can be due to various causes, including Addison's disease or following adrenal surgery.

Beyond replacement therapy, hydrocortisone is also used to treat:

* **Inflammatory conditions:**  This includes conditions affecting the skin (dermatitis, eczema), joints (arthritis), intestines (inflammatory bowel disease), lungs (asthma, bronchitis), and other organs.  It's often used for short-term management of flare-ups or exacerbations.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Hydrocortisone can help manage severe allergic reactions when other treatments aren't sufficient.
* **Autoimmune disorders:** It can suppress the overactive immune response in certain autoimmune diseases.
* **Certain cancers:** In some cases, high doses of hydrocortisone might be used in combination with other treatments for certain cancers.  This is typically a specialized application.


**Note:**  The use of hydrocortisone for conditions other than adrenal insufficiency is usually for short-term treatment of flare-ups or in acute situations. Long-term use carries significant risks.

### Dosage

Dosage varies widely depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.  It's crucial to follow the prescription exactly as directed by your doctor.  The information below is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.

**Adults:**

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition and route of administration (oral, intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM)). Doses range from a few milligrams daily for replacement therapy to hundreds of milligrams daily for severe inflammatory conditions. Specific examples include:

* **Adrenal insufficiency (chronic):**  Oral, typically 15-25 mg/day in divided doses.
* **Adrenal crisis (acute):**  IV, starting with a high dose (100mg bolus) followed by a continuous infusion or repeated doses.
* **Inflammatory conditions:** Oral or IV doses range from 20 mg to 240 mg per day, depending on severity.
* **Asthma exacerbation (off-label):** Oral, up to 200mg in divided doses for a short period.



**Children:**

Pediatric dosages are calculated based on body weight or body surface area (BSA) and are significantly lower than adult doses. Dosage must be determined and carefully monitored by a pediatrician.  


**Administration:**

Hydrocortisone comes in several forms: tablets (immediate-release and modified-release), injection (hydrocortisone sodium succinate or hydrocortisone acetate), and topical creams/ointments.  Your doctor will specify the correct form and method of administration.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Increased appetite and weight gain
* Swelling (edema)
* Mood changes (irritability, anxiety, depression)
* Sleep disturbances
* Headache
* Muscle weakness
* Increased blood sugar levels
* Thinning of the skin


Less common but serious side effects include:

* High blood pressure
* Cataracts or glaucoma
* Osteoporosis (weakening of bones)
* Infections
* Cushing's syndrome (a hormonal disorder)
* Adrenal insufficiency (if abruptly stopped after long-term use)


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, consult your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Hydrocortisone works by binding to receptors inside cells. This interaction affects numerous processes in the body, primarily reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system's activity. It does this by:

* Reducing the production of inflammatory chemicals.
* Decreasing the number of immune cells that infiltrate inflamed tissues.
* Stabilizing cell membranes, preventing further damage.

In cases of adrenal insufficiency, hydrocortisone simply replaces the cortisol the body is not producing on its own, maintaining essential bodily functions.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Hydrocortisone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug and in those with certain infections.  It should not be used with live vaccines.
* **Drug interactions:**  Hydrocortisone can interact with many other medications, including anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and certain antibiotics.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Hydrocortisone can cross the placenta and is present in breast milk.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks, and should be closely monitored by a doctor.
* **Special populations:**  Elderly patients, children, and patients with underlying health conditions (such as diabetes, heart disease, or osteoporosis) may require dosage adjustments or closer monitoring.
* **Withdrawal:**  Long-term use of hydrocortisone should be tapered gradually under medical supervision to avoid adrenal crisis.


### FAQs

* **Can I stop taking hydrocortisone abruptly?** No, abruptly stopping hydrocortisone, especially after long-term use, can be dangerous and lead to adrenal crisis.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.

* **How should I store hydrocortisone?** Store hydrocortisone as directed on the label. Typically this involves a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double up on doses.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking hydrocortisone?**  It's best to limit alcohol consumption while taking hydrocortisone, as alcohol can increase the risk of some side effects such as stomach upset. Consult your doctor for advice on alcohol consumption.

* **Is hydrocortisone habit-forming?** Hydrocortisone is not habit-forming in the same way as opioids or other addictive drugs, but the body can become dependent on it with prolonged use.  Stopping it abruptly after long-term use can be dangerous.
