# Hydroxyzine
### Generic Name
Hydroxyzine

### Usage

Hydroxyzine is primarily used to treat anxiety and itching (pruritus) caused by allergic reactions or other conditions.  It's also used to control nausea and vomiting, and as a pre-operative medication to help relax patients before surgery or other procedures.  It can also be used as an adjunct to pain medication during labor.  Importantly, many of these uses are considered "off-label," meaning they're not officially approved by regulatory agencies but are commonly practiced by healthcare professionals based on its established properties.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the form of the medication (oral tablets, syrup, or intramuscular injection).  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.  The following are examples and should not be interpreted as a replacement for medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Anxiety:** Oral dosages typically range from 50-100 mg, several times daily.  Lower doses may be used initially and adjusted based on response. Intramuscular injections may be given in higher doses under medical supervision.

* **Pruritus (Itching):** Oral dosages typically range from 25 mg three to four times daily.

* **Nausea and Vomiting:** Intramuscular injections of 25-100mg may be given as needed.

* **Pre-operative sedation:** Dosages vary and are determined by the physician based on individual patient needs.

**Children:**

Pediatric dosages are calculated based on weight (mg/kg) and the condition being treated.  It's crucial to consult a pediatrician or healthcare professional for accurate dosage instructions as there is a wide range depending on age and weight. Always check specific guidelines before administering any medication to a child.

### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Blurred vision
* Fatigue

Less common but serious side effects:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
* Irregular heartbeat
* Seizures (especially at high doses)
* Involuntary movements

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that contributes to allergic reactions and anxiety symptoms. By blocking histamine receptors, it reduces itching, inflammation, and anxiety. It also possesses mild sedative effects and may affect other neurotransmitter systems in the brain contributing to its anxiolytic properties.  It's important to remember that the precise mechanism by which it relieves anxiety isn't entirely understood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine or related compounds, in early pregnancy, and in those with certain heart conditions (QT prolongation).

* **Drug Interactions:** Hydroxyzine can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the central nervous system (CNS), such as sedatives, opioids, or alcohol.  Concomitant use should be avoided without specific consultation and guidance from a physician.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Hydroxyzine should be avoided during early pregnancy.  Use during late pregnancy and breastfeeding should be approached with caution after careful consideration of risk versus benefit by a healthcare provider.

* **Elderly and Children:**  Elderly patients are more susceptible to side effects, especially drowsiness.  Children require careful dose adjustments based on their weight and age.

* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with kidney or liver problems.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drive after taking hydroxyzine?** A: No, avoid operating machinery or driving until you know how this medication affects you as drowsiness is a common side effect.

* **Q: How should I store hydroxyzine?** A: Store hydroxyzine at room temperature and away from moisture and heat, as directed on the product label.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of effects varies depending on the route of administration and the condition being treated, but it generally starts working within 30-60 minutes.

* **Q: Is hydroxyzine habit-forming?** A: Hydroxyzine is not considered habit-forming in the typical sense, but it’s important to always follow your doctor’s instructions for dosage and duration of use.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, do not take a double dose to make up for the missed dose unless otherwise instructed by your doctor.

* **Q: Can I stop taking hydroxyzine suddenly?** A: Consult your doctor before suddenly stopping hydroxyzine.  Stopping abruptly might be unwise, especially if it's been used for prolonged periods.
