# Hydroxyzine

**Generic Name:** Hydroxyzine

**Usage:**

Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine used to treat:

* **Anxiety:**  It's used to relieve symptoms of anxiety, such as nervousness, tension, and worry.  It's often prescribed for short-term relief or in situations causing acute anxiety.
* **Itching and hives (urticaria):**  It effectively reduces itching associated with allergic reactions, like hives.
* **Sedation (pre-operative):**  It can be used to help calm patients before surgery or other medical procedures.
* **Nausea and vomiting (sometimes):** In some cases, it may be used to help control nausea and vomiting, though this is less common.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is the most common and often significant side effect.
* **Dry mouth:**  Can cause discomfort and affect speech.
* **Dizziness:** May lead to falls or impaired coordination.
* **Blurred vision:**  Can affect daily activities.
* **Constipation:** Can cause discomfort and digestive issues.
* **Headache:** Often mild and temporary.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or sluggish.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Fast heartbeat (tachycardia):** Seek immediate medical attention.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):**  May cause dizziness or fainting.
* **Seizures:** A rare but serious side effect.
* **Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes):** Indicates liver problems and requires immediate medical attention.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms can range from rash to difficulty breathing. Seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.

**How it Works:**

Hydroxyzine primarily works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that is involved in allergic reactions and anxiety responses.  By blocking histamine, it reduces itching and swelling in allergic reactions. Its anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) effects are thought to be related to its ability to block certain receptors in the brain, affecting neurotransmitter activity.  The exact mechanism for its anxiolytic effects is not fully understood.

**FAQs:**

* **Is hydroxyzine habit-forming?**  Hydroxyzine has a low potential for abuse and dependence, but prolonged use can lead to tolerance, meaning higher doses may be needed for the same effect. It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions and not take it longer than prescribed.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking hydroxyzine?**  Alcohol can significantly enhance the sedative effects of hydroxyzine, increasing the risk of drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired coordination.  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking this medication.
* **Can I drive while taking hydroxyzine?**  Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how hydroxyzine affects you. Drowsiness is a common side effect.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I take hydroxyzine with other medications?**  Tell your doctor about all medications, vitamins, and supplements you're taking, as hydroxyzine may interact with other drugs.
* **How long does it take to work?**  The effects of hydroxyzine can vary, but you might feel some relief from anxiety or itching within 30-60 minutes of taking it.
