# Hyoscyamine
### Generic Name
Hyoscyamine

### Usage
Hyoscyamine is an anticholinergic medication primarily used to relieve symptoms of various gastrointestinal disorders.  Its main application is in managing spasms and discomfort associated with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, and colic.  It can also offer symptomatic relief in cystitis (bladder inflammation).  Hyoscyamine may be used as an adjunctive therapy in peptic ulcer disease and irritable bowel syndrome, working alongside other treatments to manage symptoms.  Additionally, it may be used as adjunctive treatment for hypermotility of the lower urinary tract.

### How it Works

Hyoscyamine is an anticholinergic drug. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the functioning of the parasympathetic nervous system.  By reducing the effects of acetylcholine, hyoscyamine decreases the contractions of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract and bladder, relieving spasms and reducing motility. This helps to alleviate pain and discomfort associated with various gastrointestinal and urinary conditions.  It also reduces secretions, which can be helpful in some conditions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hyoscyamine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to belladonna alkaloids or any component of the formulation; glaucoma; obstructive uropathy; myasthenia gravis; obstructive gastrointestinal tract disease; paralytic ileus; intestinal atony (especially in elderly or debilitated patients); severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; unstable cardiovascular status; and myocardial ischemia.

* **Interactions:** Avoid concomitant use with other drugs that also have anticholinergic effects, as this can increase the risk of side effects.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Hyoscyamine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  It is excreted in breast milk, so use caution if breastfeeding.

* **Specific populations:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hiatal hernia, hyperthyroidism, autonomic neuropathy, and prostatic hyperplasia, and in pediatric patients.
