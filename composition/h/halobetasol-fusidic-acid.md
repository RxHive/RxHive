# Halobetasol + Fusidic Acid

**Generic Name:** Halobetasol propionate + Fusidic acid

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical corticosteroid and antibiotic used to treat inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial infection.  Specific indications often include eczema (dermatitis) with a secondary bacterial infection, psoriasis with a secondary bacterial infection, and other similar conditions.  It's crucial to note that this medication is only for topical use; it should never be ingested or used in the eyes.  A doctor's prescription is always necessary.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in severity and frequency depending on the individual and the duration of treatment. Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, irritation, redness, thinning of the skin, skin atrophy (thinning and weakening of the skin),  stretch marks (striae), folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), acneiform eruptions (acne-like breakouts), hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).  Long-term or overuse can lead to more serious skin changes.
* **Systemic effects (less common but possible with prolonged use or large surface area application):** These are more likely in children and with occlusive dressings. Systemic effects can include suppression of the adrenal glands (leading to hormonal imbalances), Cushing's syndrome (a hormonal disorder), and cataracts.


**How it Works:**

* **Halobetasol propionate:** This is a potent corticosteroid. It works by reducing inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin.  It decreases the production of inflammatory mediators.
* **Fusidic acid:** This is an antibiotic that fights against a range of bacteria commonly causing skin infections.  It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, thereby preventing bacterial growth and killing the bacteria.

The combination of these two active ingredients tackles both the inflammatory and infectious components of the skin condition.
