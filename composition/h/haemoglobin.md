# Haemoglobin
### Generic Name
Haemoglobin (Note: Haemoglobin itself is not a medicine; it's a protein.  This information describes the use of *products containing haemoglobin* or *haemoglobin-based therapies*, which are used to treat specific medical conditions.)

### Usage
Haemoglobin, or rather, haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs), are used in specific medical situations where there's a critical need to increase oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood.  These situations may include:

* **Acute blood loss:**  In cases of severe trauma or surgery where rapid blood loss has depleted the body's oxygen supply, HBOCs can temporarily provide oxygen transport until blood transfusions or other treatments can be implemented.
* **Anemia:**  Certain types of anemia, characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or haemoglobin, may benefit from temporary support with HBOCs, although this is not a standard treatment for all anemias.
* **Cardiac surgery:** During certain types of heart surgery, HBOCs may be used to help maintain adequate oxygen levels.


It's crucial to understand that HBOCs are generally used as a *temporary* measure in life-threatening situations, not as a long-term replacement for red blood cells.  The specific application and suitability of HBOCs are determined by a medical professional based on the individual's condition.

### Dosage
There is no single dosage for "haemoglobin" as a medicine because different haemoglobin-based products exist with varying formulations and administration methods.  The dosage of any specific HBOC will be determined by a physician based on factors such as:

* **Severity of the condition:** The amount of oxygen needed will determine the dose.
* **Patient weight and size:**  Dosage is often adjusted based on body mass.
* **Type of HBOC:** Different products have different dosing regimens.

The medication might be administered intravenously (IV) directly into a vein.  Precise dosage instructions are always provided by the physician or the product's accompanying literature.  There's no "over-the-counter" or self-administered form of haemoglobin-based therapy.

### Side Effects
Potential side effects of haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers can vary depending on the specific product and individual patient response. However, some potential side effects include:

* **Increased blood pressure:**  A common side effect, often requiring monitoring.
* **Changes in kidney function:**  Some individuals may experience altered kidney function, requiring monitoring of kidney parameters.
* **Allergic reactions:**  As with any medication, allergic reactions are possible.
* **Clotting problems:** In rare cases, HBOCs can lead to blood clot formation.
* **Nausea and vomiting:** Less common but potential side effects.

**Serious but less common side effects** may also occur. It's vital to report any concerning side effects to a medical professional immediately.

### How it Works
Haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers work by mimicking the function of natural haemoglobin found in red blood cells. They bind to oxygen in the lungs and release it to the tissues, thus providing supplemental oxygen transport when the body's natural haemoglobin levels are insufficient or compromised. The specific mechanism can vary slightly depending on the type of HBOC used, whether it's a modified human haemoglobin or a chemically modified form.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  HBOCs are not suitable for all patients and may be contraindicated in those with certain conditions (e.g., severe pre-existing kidney disease).  A physician will assess suitability.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potential interactions with other medications need to be considered, and a doctor should be informed of all medications being taken.
* **Pregnant and breastfeeding women:**  The safety of HBOCs during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established, and caution is warranted.  Use is typically restricted to situations where the benefits significantly outweigh the potential risks.
* **Children and older adults:**  Use in these populations might require adjusted dosage or careful monitoring due to variations in physiological parameters.
* **Allergic Reactions:**  A thorough allergy history is important before administration.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take haemoglobin as a supplement to improve athletic performance?** A: No. Haemoglobin-based products are strictly controlled medications; their use is limited to specific medical conditions under the supervision of a doctor. Self-medication is extremely dangerous.

* **Q: How long does the effect of HBOCs last?** A: The duration of the effect depends on the specific product and the patient's condition; it's typically temporary.

* **Q: How are HBOCs stored?** A:  Specific storage instructions vary depending on the HBOC; this information will be provided by the physician or on the product labeling.
