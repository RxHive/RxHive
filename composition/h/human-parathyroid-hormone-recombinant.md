# Human Parathyroid Hormone (Recombinant)
### Generic Name
Human Parathyroid Hormone (Recombinant)

### Usage
Human parathyroid hormone (recombinant), often abbreviated as rhPTH(1-84), is primarily used as an adjunct therapy for hypoparathyroidism.  This means it's used *in addition to* other treatments, specifically calcium and vitamin D supplements, to manage low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) in individuals with this condition.  It's crucial to understand that rhPTH(1-84) is *not* a first-line treatment for hypoparathyroidism; it's reserved for cases where adequate calcium levels cannot be maintained with calcium and vitamin D alone.  This is due to a potential risk of osteosarcoma (a type of bone cancer), which necessitates careful patient selection and monitoring.


### Dosage
Dosage for rhPTH(1-84) is highly individualized and depends on several factors, including the patient's serum calcium levels (corrected for albumin), 24-hour urinary calcium excretion, and response to therapy. It's administered via subcutaneous injection, typically in the thigh, alternating thighs daily.

**Adults:**

* **Initial Dose:**  The typical starting dose is 50 mcg daily.  If the patient is already taking active forms of vitamin D, the vitamin D dose is usually reduced by 50% before starting rhPTH(1-84), provided serum calcium is >7.5 mg/dL.  Calcium supplement doses are generally maintained initially. Serum calcium levels are closely monitored 3-7 days after starting or adjusting the dose.
* **Maintenance Dose:** The goal is to find the lowest effective dose that maintains total serum calcium (albumin-corrected) within the lower half of the normal range (approximately 8-9 mg/dL) without the need for active vitamin D and with only sufficient calcium supplementation to meet daily requirements.  
* **Dose Adjustments:**  Doses can be adjusted in increments of 25 mcg every 4 weeks. The maximum dose is 100 mcg/day. If serum calcium remains below 8 mg/dL despite the use of vitamin D and calcium supplements, a decrease in dosage to a minimum of 25 mcg/day may be necessary if calcium levels exceed 9mg/dL after discontinuation of vitamin D and reduction of calcium supplement.  Careful monitoring of serum calcium levels and clinical assessment is essential throughout the process.
* **Missed Dose:** If a dose is missed, administer the next dose as soon as possible.  Additional exogenous calcium may be necessary if hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) occurs.  Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided due to risk of severe hypocalcemia.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of rhPTH(1-84) in children under 18 have not been established.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Nervous system: Paresthesia (numbness or tingling), headache, hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to touch)
* Endocrine and metabolic: Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), hypercalcemia (high blood calcium)
* Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, vomiting
* Immunologic: Antibody development
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Genitourinary: Hypercalciuria (high calcium in urine)

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Seizures
* Hypertension (high blood pressure)
* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Inhibited conversion of vitamin D3

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
rhPTH(1-84) mimics the action of naturally occurring parathyroid hormone.  It works by increasing blood calcium levels through three primary mechanisms:

1. **Increased renal calcium reabsorption:**  It promotes the reabsorption of calcium from the kidneys back into the bloodstream.
2. **Increased intestinal calcium absorption:** It indirectly increases calcium absorption from the gut by stimulating the conversion of inactive vitamin D to its active form (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).
3. **Increased bone turnover:** It increases the breakdown of bone tissue, releasing calcium into the circulation.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  rhPTH(1-84) is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication or its components and those at increased risk of osteosarcoma.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Concomitant use with bisphosphonates (drugs used to treat osteoporosis) can reduce the effectiveness of rhPTH(1-84).  Use with cardiac glycosides (like digoxin) may increase the risk of digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops, requiring careful monitoring.
* **Warnings:** There is a potential risk of osteosarcoma, particularly with prolonged use.  This risk necessitates careful patient selection.  Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypo- and hypercalcemia is crucial.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor before starting this medication.  The medication is only available through a restricted program due to this risk. Patients with pre-existing conditions like Paget's disease, unexplained elevated alkaline phosphatase, or a history of bone radiation therapy should generally avoid using this medication.


### FAQs

    * **A:** It's given as a daily subcutaneous injection.

* **Q: How long will I need to take rhPTH(1-84)?**
    * **A:** The duration of treatment is determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and response.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**
    * **A:** Take the missed dose as soon as possible, but don't double up on doses.

* **Q: Are there any specific storage instructions?**
    * **A:** Follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions for proper storage.
