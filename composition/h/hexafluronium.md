# Hexafluronium
### Generic Name
Hexafluronium Bromide (Hexafluorenium Bromide)

### Usage
Hexafluronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent used primarily as an adjunct to succinylcholine (also known as suxamethonium chloride).  Its main purpose is to prolong the muscle relaxation effects of succinylcholine and to suppress the fasciculations (brief muscle contractions) that can occur with succinylcholine.  This combination is employed during surgical procedures to maintain muscle relaxation for an extended period.  It's important to note that hexafluronium bromide is no longer marketed in the United States.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage is determined by the physician based on the individual patient's needs and the specific surgical procedure. There are two primary methods of administration:

* **Prolongation of Succinylcholine:**  Typically, 0.1-0.4 mg/kg is administered intravenously (IV) 3 minutes before succinylcholine.  Additional doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg may be given later if needed, at intervals of 80-100 minutes, depending on the duration of the surgery.

* **Intermittent Technique:** A dose of 0.4 mg/kg of hexafluronium bromide is given IV, followed by 0.2 mg/kg of succinylcholine three minutes later.  Subsequent doses of succinylcholine (0.15-0.25 mg/kg) are given as needed, with additional hexafluronium bromide (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) administered if the surgery extends beyond 30 minutes.


**Pediatric Dosage:** The safety and efficacy of hexafluronium bromide in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment.  For patients with renal insufficiency, no dosage adjustment is generally needed when using hexafluronium bromide with succinylcholine for a moderate duration of neuromuscular block.


### Side Effects
Common side effects are not specifically defined in readily available resources for this drug. However, potential side effects associated with its use (often in conjunction with succinylcholine) may include:

* Bronchospasm
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Hyperthermia (high body temperature)
* Increased salivation
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Muscle paralysis (this is the intended effect but can be excessive)
* Increased intraocular pressure


Serious, but less common side effects could also occur.  Any unusual or concerning symptoms should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works
Hexafluronium bromide is a non-competitive, reversible inhibitor of human plasma cholinesterase (also called pseudocholinesterase). Cholinesterase is an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter crucial for muscle function. By inhibiting cholinesterase, hexafluronium bromide prolongs the action of succinylcholine, which also affects acetylcholine.  This extended effect of succinylcholine leads to more sustained muscle relaxation.  Essentially, it prevents the rapid breakdown of the muscle relaxant, allowing it to work for a longer time.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Hexafluronium bromide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it, bromides, or succinylcholine; acute narrow-angle glaucoma; myopathies associated with elevated creatinine phosphokinase; genetically determined disorders of plasma pseudocholinesterase; penetrating eye injuries; and a personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia.

* **Increased Risk:**  Patients with asthma are at increased risk of bronchospasm.

* **Use with Caution:**  Use with caution in asthmatic patients.

* **Other Considerations:**  Because this drug is used in conjunction with succinylcholine, the precautions and contraindications associated with succinylcholine must also be considered.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is hexafluronium bromide administered?** A: It is administered intravenously (IV).

* **Q: Is hexafluronium bromide available in the US?** A: No, it is no longer marketed in the United States.

* **Q: What are the potential risks associated with hexafluronium bromide?** A:  Potential risks include bronchospasm, tachycardia, hypotension, and other serious side effects.  Always consult with a healthcare professional.

* **Q: How should hexafluronium bromide be stored?** A:  Information on specific storage requirements is not readily available, as it's no longer marketed in the US.  Always follow any storage instructions provided by a pharmacist or healthcare provider if it is obtained from an alternative source.

* **Q: Who should not use hexafluronium bromide?** A:  Patients with certain allergies, eye conditions, or muscle disorders, as well as those with a history of malignant hyperthermia, should not use this medication.  A healthcare professional can determine suitability.
