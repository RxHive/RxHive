# House Dust Mite Allergen Extract
### Generic Name
House Dust Mite Allergen Extract

### Usage
House dust mite (HDM) allergen extract is used as immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis (hay fever) caused by house dust mites, with or without conjunctivitis (eye inflammation).  This immunotherapy is suitable for adults aged 18-65 years who have been confirmed to have a house dust mite allergy through IgE antibody testing (blood test) for *Dermatophagoides farinae* or *Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus*, or through skin prick testing.  It's crucial to understand that this medication is *not* for immediate relief of allergy symptoms; it's a long-term treatment to help modify the body's response to the allergen.


### Dosage
**Adults (18-65 years):** The typical adult dose is one 12 SQ-HDM tablet sublingually (under the tongue) once daily.  SQ-HDM is a unit measuring the standardized biological potency, major allergen content, and complexity of the allergen extract.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of HDM allergen extract have not been established in children under 18 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.

### How it Works
The exact mechanism of how allergen immunotherapy works isn't fully understood. However, it's believed to shift the immune system's response from a type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) response (which causes allergic reactions) to a type 1 helper T-cell (Th1) response. This shift is associated with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5), increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and the production of IgG blocking antibodies which compete with IgE antibodies for allergen binding.  It may also involve changes in regulatory T-lymphocytes and a reduction in mast cells and eosinophils (types of immune cells involved in allergic reactions).


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.
*   Severe, unstable, or uncontrolled asthma.
*   History of severe systemic allergic reaction.
*   History of severe local reaction after sublingual allergen immunotherapy.
*   History of eosinophilic esophagitis.
*   Concurrent use of beta-blockers.
*   Active oral cavity inflammation (e.g., oral lichen planus with ulceration, severe oral candidiasis, recent dental extraction).


**Warnings:**

*   There's an increased risk of eosinophilic esophagitis and life-threatening allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and severe laryngopharyngeal restriction.  
*   Upper airway compromise can occur.
*   This medication should be administered and monitored by healthcare professionals experienced in managing allergic diseases.
*   Patients should be given auto-injectable epinephrine and trained on its use.  Immediate medical attention should be sought if epinephrine is needed.


**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Sufficient data on pregnant women are lacking to assess the risks to the pregnancy. Data on the effects on breastfeeding infants or milk production is also unavailable.  The decision to breastfeed during treatment should consider the potential risks to the infant, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of treatment for the mother.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: Allergen immunotherapy is not a quick-fix; it usually takes several months to see a significant improvement in symptoms.
*   **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe reaction?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.  Use your prescribed epinephrine auto-injector if trained to do so.
*   **Q: Can I take this with other medications?** A: Inform your doctor about all medications you're taking to check for potential interactions.  Avoid taking beta-blockers concurrently.
*   **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the packaging.
*   **Q: Can I eat or drink before or after taking the medication?** A: Avoid food and beverages for at least 5 minutes after administration.
*   **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance. Do not double the dose.
