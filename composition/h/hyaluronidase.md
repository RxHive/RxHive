# Hyaluronidase
### Generic Name
Hyaluronidase

### Usage

Hyaluronidase is an enzyme primarily used to increase the absorption and spread of other injected medications.  This makes it helpful in several situations.  Its main use is as an adjuvant in subcutaneous fluid administration (hypodermoclysis), assisting with hydration by improving the absorption of fluids given under the skin.  It's also used to enhance the absorption of radiopaque agents during subcutaneous urography, improving the clarity of X-ray images.  Additionally, it can aid in managing extravasation, where a drug has leaked out of a blood vessel into surrounding tissue.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the specific use and the patient's age.  Always follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.  The following information provides general guidance only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Dehydration (hypodermoclysis):**  Dosages range from 150 to 1500 units, depending on the concentration of the solution used and the volume of fluid being administered. This is usually given subcutaneously.
* **Enhanced drug absorption:**  Typically, 50-300 units (often 150 units) are used, either injected before the other drug or mixed with it, if compatible.  Route of administration varies.
* **Extravasation management:**  The total dose ranges from 150 to 900 units, divided into multiple injections around the extravasation site.  The solution is often diluted with normal saline.

**Children:**

Dosage in children is significantly lower and highly dependent on age, weight, and the specific indication.  Neonates and infants will require substantially lower doses than older children and adolescents.  Always consult the prescribing information or a healthcare professional for precise pediatric dosing.  For example, in hypodermoclysis for dehydration, dosages may be based on units per milliliter of administered fluid rather than a fixed number of units.


**Administration:** Hyaluronidase is typically administered subcutaneously (under the skin), intramuscularly (into a muscle), or intradermally (into the skin), depending on the intended use.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness) are possible.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Anaphylactic-like reactions, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypersensitivity reactions, and urticaria (hives) are possible, though rare.  These are more likely with intravenous administration.


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those listed above, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Hyaluronidase works by breaking down hyaluronic acid, a substance that acts as a kind of "cement" holding tissues together.  By degrading this hyaluronic acid, hyaluronidase temporarily increases the permeability of tissues, allowing for better absorption and spread of other substances injected into the body. This is why it is helpful in aiding fluid absorption during hydration and improving the distribution of drugs or contrast agents.

### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Hyaluronidase is contraindicated in individuals with a known allergy to hyaluronidase or any component of the formulation.  A skin test is often recommended before administration to check for hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:**  The effects of hyaluronidase can be altered by other medications, including heparin, salicylates, NSAIDs, and urokinase.  It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of hyaluronidase during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Consult a doctor before using it if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Renal and Hepatic Impairment:** While specific dosage adjustments aren't always indicated, caution is advised when using hyaluronidase in patients with impaired kidney or liver function.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is hyaluronidase stored?** A: Storage instructions vary depending on the specific product formulation.  Always refer to the product labeling for proper storage instructions. Generally, it needs to be refrigerated.

* **Q: How long does it take for hyaluronidase to work?** A: The onset of action depends on the intended use and the administered dose.  Its effects are generally temporary.

* **Q:  Can I use hyaluronidase for all types of extravasation?** A: No.  Hyaluronidase is not effective for all extravasated substances and is not suitable for extravasation of vasoconstrictors (like dopamine and norepinephrine).

* **Q: What should I do if I experience an allergic reaction?** A:  Stop using the medication immediately and seek immediate medical attention.  Allergic reactions to hyaluronidase can range from mild to severe, and prompt medical intervention is crucial.
