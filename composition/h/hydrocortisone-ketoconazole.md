# Hydrocortisone + Ketoconazole

**Generic Name:** Hydrocortisone + Ketoconazole

**Usage:**  This combination is typically used topically (applied to the skin) to treat skin conditions characterized by both inflammation and fungal infection.  Specific conditions may include:

* **Seborrheic dermatitis:** A common inflammatory skin condition that causes scaling and redness, often on the scalp, face, and chest.  The hydrocortisone addresses inflammation, while the ketoconazole targets the fungus (often *Malassezia* species) frequently involved.
* **Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor):** A fungal infection causing discolored patches on the skin.
* **Other fungal skin infections with inflammatory components:** While not as common a primary use, it may be prescribed for other conditions if both fungal infection and inflammation are significant.

**Important Note:** This combination is for topical use only and should not be ingested.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist.  It's not intended for every fungal skin infection and may not be suitable for all patients.

**Side Effects:** Topical application generally has fewer side effects than oral medications.  However, potential side effects include:

* **Burning or stinging:**  A common initial reaction that usually subsides.
* **Itching:** This can either improve or worsen the condition temporarily.
* **Skin dryness, redness, or irritation:** This can be more pronounced with prolonged use or overuse.
* **Thinning of the skin (skin atrophy):**  A potential side effect with long-term or high-potency corticosteroid use.
* **Stretch marks (striae):** Another potential long-term corticosteroid side effect.
* **Acne:** In some individuals.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:**  An allergic reaction to one or both components of the cream.
* **HPA axis suppression:** Although less likely with topical application, prolonged use of high-potency corticosteroids can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This is more of a concern with large surface area application or occlusion (covering the area).


**How it Works:**

* **Hydrocortisone:** A corticosteroid (a type of steroid hormone) that reduces inflammation by decreasing the release of inflammatory substances.  It works by binding to receptors within skin cells, thus modulating inflammatory pathways.
* **Ketoconazole:** An antifungal agent that works by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to fungal cell death.

The combination provides a dual approach, addressing both the inflammatory and the fungal aspects of the skin condition.
