# Hydrocortisone + Ketoconazole
### Generic Name
Hydrocortisone + Ketoconazole

### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used topically to treat fungal infections of the skin that are accompanied by inflammation.  The hydrocortisone component reduces inflammation and itching, while the ketoconazole component combats the fungal infection itself.  Conditions effectively treated often include seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff with inflammation), eczema complicated by a fungal infection, and ringworm with significant inflammation.  It's crucial to understand that this is not a treatment for all fungal infections or inflammatory skin conditions; a doctor's diagnosis is essential before use.  While sometimes used for other inflammatory skin conditions, its primary and most effective use is specifically where both inflammation and fungal infection are present.

### Dosage

Dosage is determined by the specific formulation (cream, ointment, lotion) and the area affected.  Generally, a thin layer is applied to the affected skin area twice daily, or as directed by a physician.  **Do not exceed the prescribed dosage or frequency.**

* **Adults:** Dosage varies depending on the strength and formulation of the cream, ointment, or lotion prescribed. Always follow your doctor's instructions.
* **Children:** Use in children should only be under the strict supervision of a pediatrician or dermatologist.  The dosage will be adjusted based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.
* **Oral or IV administration:**  This combination medication is intended for topical use only and is not available in oral or intravenous formulations.  Attempting to ingest or inject this medication can be dangerous and should never be done.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are usually mild and localized to the application site. These may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Skin irritation, redness, or dryness
* Itching
* Thinning of the skin (with prolonged use)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, warrant immediate medical attention:

* Severe allergic reaction (difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
* Increased skin infection or worsening of existing infection
* Skin discoloration
* Acne-like eruptions


If you experience any unusual or persistent side effects, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune response in the affected skin area. This alleviates itching and redness associated with the fungal infection. Ketoconazole, an antifungal, inhibits the growth of fungi by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of the fungal cell membrane. By disrupting ergosterol production, ketoconazole effectively kills the fungus and prevents its further spread.  The combined action of these two active ingredients provides both anti-inflammatory and antifungal effects, leading to faster healing.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication should not be used on individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to hydrocortisone, ketoconazole, or any other components of the formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While topical application minimizes systemic interactions, inform your doctor of all other medications you are using, especially other corticosteroids or antifungal medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only occur under the direct supervision of a physician, as the potential risks and benefits must be carefully weighed.
* **Children:** Use in children should be carefully monitored by a pediatrician or dermatologist.
* **Elderly:**  The elderly may be more susceptible to skin thinning with prolonged use.
* **Avoid use on:** Broken skin, infected wounds (unless the infection is fungal and approved by a doctor), and the face (unless specifically directed by a physician).
* **Prolonged use:**  Long-term use may lead to skin thinning and other adverse effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use this on my face?** A: Generally, no.  Use on the face should only be under a doctor's direct supervision due to increased risk of side effects.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: Improvement is usually seen within a few days, but complete resolution may take several weeks depending on the severity of the infection and inflammation.
* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is close to the time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.
* **Q: Can I stop using it when the symptoms improve?** A:  No. Continue using the medication as directed by your doctor, even if your symptoms improve, to prevent recurrence of the infection.  Stopping treatment prematurely may lead to relapse.  Your doctor will advise when to discontinue the medication.
