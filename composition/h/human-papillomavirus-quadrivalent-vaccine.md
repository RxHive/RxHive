# Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent Vaccine
### Generic Name
Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent Vaccine

### Usage
The human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent vaccine is used to prevent infections caused by four types of HPV: types 6, 11, 16, and 18.  These HPV types are responsible for a significant number of cancers and genital warts.  

The primary use is preventing cervical cancer, which is largely caused by HPV types 16 and 18.  The vaccine also helps prevent other HPV-related cancers, including cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx (the back of the throat).  Additionally, it prevents genital warts, mainly caused by HPV types 6 and 11.  It's important to note that this vaccine doesn't protect against all types of HPV, and it doesn't treat existing HPV infections or cancers.

### Dosage

The recommended dosage varies based on age and immunocompetence. The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM).

**For individuals aged 9 to 26 years:**

* **Non-immunocompromised:**  A two-dose series is recommended for those aged 9-14 years, given 6 to 12 months apart.  A three-dose series is recommended for those aged 15 to 26 years, given at months 0, 1-2, and 6.  For both regimens,  the minimum intervals between doses should be observed.  Initiating vaccination at age 11-12 years is ideal.

* **Immunocompromised:** A three-dose series is recommended for those aged 9 to 26 years regardless of the immunocompromising conditions, following the same interval guidelines outlined for the non-immunocompromised 3-dose schedule.

**For adults (27 to 45 years of age):**

* A three-dose series is given at months 0, 2, and 6. The second dose should be administered at least one month after the first, and the third at least three months after the second.  All three doses should be completed within twelve months.


**Catch-up Immunization:** If doses have already been administered, do not restart the series.  Follow the guidelines based on the number of doses received already.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects (affecting more than 10% of recipients):**

* Headache
* Pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site
* Fever


**Less common side effects (affecting 1-10% of recipients):**

* Dizziness
* Itching at the injection site
* Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, toothache
* Bruising at the injection site
* Joint pain, muscle pain
* Sore throat
* Upper respiratory tract infection


**Rare but serious side effects (less than 1%, reported in post-marketing surveillance or case reports):**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*  Guillain-Barr√© syndrome
*  Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis
* Syncope (fainting), which may lead to falls and injuries

If any adverse effects occur, especially serious ones,  consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

The HPV quadrivalent vaccine is an inactivated vaccine. This means it contains virus-like particles (VLPs) of the four HPV types.  These VLPs are not able to cause infection but trigger the body's immune system to produce antibodies against these specific HPV types. These antibodies then help to prevent infection with those particular HPV strains, thus reducing the risk of developing HPV-related diseases.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** The vaccine is contraindicated for individuals with a known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose.
* **Pregnancy:**  The vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy.  Pregnancy should be avoided during the vaccination series. If pregnancy occurs, the remaining doses should be delayed until after delivery.
* **Breastfeeding:** The vaccine is not thought to affect breastfeeding mothers or infants, but it's recommended to discuss with a healthcare provider.
* **Immunocompromised individuals:**  Immunocompromised individuals may have a reduced immune response to the vaccine.  Healthcare providers should carefully assess these cases.
* **Interactions:**  Certain immunosuppressants (like belimumab and fingolimod) may diminish the vaccine's effectiveness.  Discuss any medications with your doctor before getting vaccinated.  Other vaccines should be administered according to recommendations.
* **Bleeding disorders:** Use caution in individuals with bleeding disorders or those on anticoagulants.  Monitor closely for injection site bleeding.
* **Syncope:**  Patients should be monitored for fifteen minutes after vaccination to prevent falls or other injuries due to fainting.
