# Haloperidol
### Generic Name
Haloperidol

### Usage

Haloperidol is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic medication primarily used to manage the symptoms of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.  Its main action is to reduce hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking associated with these conditions.  It's also used to treat Tourette syndrome, managing the involuntary tics characteristic of the disorder.  Furthermore, haloperidol finds application in managing severe behavioral problems in children and adolescents, though this use is often considered off-label in some contexts.  Other off-label uses include treating  breakthrough nausea and vomiting (especially in cancer patients), chorea in Huntington's disease, delirium and agitation (particularly in intensive care settings), and even in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting.  It's important to note that off-label uses should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

Haloperidol dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and response to the medication.  The information below is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.


**Adults:**

* **Psychosis:** Oral administration typically starts at 0.5-5 mg twice or three times daily, adjusted according to individual response and tolerance.
* **Schizophrenia:** Oral, intramuscular (IM), or intravenous (IV) routes are possible. Starting doses range from 2-10 mg daily, divided into doses. The usual maintenance dose is generally lower, often ≤ 10 mg daily. Doses over 30 mg/day are usually not recommended.  Long-acting injectable forms (decanoate) exist for maintenance therapy, with initial and maintenance doses determined by the physician based on individual needs and response to oral medication.  These require careful titration and often involve an overlap period with oral medication.
* **Tourette Syndrome:** Oral treatment begins at lower doses (0.5-2 mg twice or three times daily) and may be gradually increased if necessary.
* **Off-label uses:** Dosages for off-label indications (like nausea and vomiting, delirium, etc.) are highly variable and should be determined by a physician based on the specific circumstances.


**Children:**

Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and carefully titrated under strict medical supervision.  Starting doses are much lower than in adults, usually in the range of 0.5 mg/day and are increased gradually, often in increments of 0.5 mg every 5–7 days.  The maximum dose also differs depending on the child's weight and age, and appropriate formulations (e.g., oral solutions) are crucial for precise dosing.

**Forms:** Haloperidol is available in oral tablets, oral solutions, and injectable forms (including long-acting injectable preparations).

**Administration:** Oral formulations should be taken with food to minimize gastrointestinal upset.  Intramuscular injections should be administered using appropriate techniques (e.g., Z-track method) to prevent leakage. Intravenous administration should only be done under the direct supervision of a qualified medical professional.


### Side Effects

Haloperidol can cause a range of side effects, varying in severity and frequency.  Some are common, while others are less frequent but potentially more serious.


**Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS): These include muscle stiffness, tremors, restlessness (akathisia), and involuntary muscle movements (dystonia).  These are more frequent with higher potency antipsychotics.

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS): A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.
* Tardive dyskinesia:  A potentially irreversible movement disorder that can develop after long-term use.
* Prolonged QT interval: This can increase the risk of potentially fatal heart rhythm disturbances.
*  Hypotension (low blood pressure), particularly orthostatic hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing).


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are serious or persistent, it's vital to contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Haloperidol primarily works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating mood, movement, and thought processes. By reducing dopamine activity, haloperidol helps to alleviate the positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) of psychosis. While it's primarily a dopamine antagonist, its actions on other neurotransmitter systems are also relevant to its overall effects.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Haloperidol should not be used in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the drug or those with certain neurological conditions (like Parkinson's disease) or severe CNS depression.
* **Drug Interactions:** Haloperidol can interact with many other medications, including other CNS depressants, certain antidepressants, and some cardiovascular drugs.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Haloperidol is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on a developing fetus are not fully understood.  Use during pregnancy should be carefully considered, and breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking haloperidol.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Haloperidol carries a significant risk of increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.  It's not approved for this indication.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients with cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal impairment, or those prone to seizures should be closely monitored.  Regular monitoring of blood counts and ECGs may be necessary in certain individuals.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Haloperidol suddenly?** A: No, never stop taking haloperidol abruptly.  Sudden cessation can lead to withdrawal symptoms.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: How should I store Haloperidol?** A: Store haloperidol as directed on the prescription label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Haloperidol?** A:  It's generally recommended to avoid alcohol while taking haloperidol, as alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of the medication.

* **Q:  How long does it take to see results from Haloperidol?** A:  The timeframe for noticing improvement can vary.  It might take several days or even weeks before you experience the full benefits of the medication.

* **Q: Are there alternatives to Haloperidol?** A: Yes, several other antipsychotic medications are available.  Your doctor can discuss alternatives if haloperidol is not suitable for you.  This might include newer, second-generation antipsychotics, which are often associated with a different side effect profile.
