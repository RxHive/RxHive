# Haloperidol

**Generic Name:** Haloperidol

**Usage:**

Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat:

* **Schizophrenia:**  It helps manage positive symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.  It can also help with negative symptoms in some individuals, though this is less consistent.
* **Acute psychosis:** This includes psychotic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and other conditions.
* **Tics associated with Tourette's syndrome:**  It can help reduce the severity of tics, although it's not a first-line treatment.
* **Severe behavioral disturbances:** In certain situations, it may be used to manage severe agitation, aggression, or other disruptive behaviors in individuals with dementia or other conditions, although its use in this population is becoming less common due to potential risks.
* **Nausea and vomiting (antiemetic):**  While less common now, it can be used to control severe nausea and vomiting.


**Side Effects:**

Haloperidol can cause a wide range of side effects, varying in severity from person to person.  Some common side effects include:

* **Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS):** These are movement disorders that include akathisia (restlessness), dystonia (muscle spasms), parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, slow movement), and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, often of the face and tongue â€“ this can be irreversible).  These are particularly concerning and a reason for careful monitoring.
* **Sedation:** Drowsiness and fatigue are common, especially initially.
* **Dry mouth:**
* **Constipation:**
* **Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing):** This can lead to dizziness and fainting.
* **Weight gain:**
* **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):** This is a rare but life-threatening condition characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability.  Requires immediate medical attention.
* **Elevated prolactin levels:** This can lead to breast enlargement (gynecomastia), galactorrhea (milk production), menstrual irregularities, and decreased libido.
* **Cardiac effects:**  Can affect the heart rhythm in some individuals.
* **Photosensitivity:** Increased sensitivity to sunlight.
* **Blurred vision:**


**How it Works:**

Haloperidol is a dopamine receptor antagonist. This means it blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain.  An overabundance of dopamine is thought to contribute to the symptoms of psychosis. By blocking dopamine receptors, haloperidol helps reduce these symptoms.  It also affects other neurotransmitters to varying degrees.


**FAQs:**

* **Is haloperidol addictive?**  Haloperidol itself is not considered physically addictive in the same way as opioids or stimulants. However, individuals may develop tolerance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect.  Stopping haloperidol abruptly can lead to withdrawal symptoms.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of haloperidol can vary, but symptom improvement may be noticeable within days to weeks.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking haloperidol?** Alcohol can increase the sedative effects of haloperidol and should be avoided or consumed only in moderation under strict medical supervision.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can haloperidol be taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Haloperidol should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Discuss this with your doctor.
* **What are the long-term effects of haloperidol?**  Long-term use can increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia and other side effects.  Regular monitoring by a doctor is crucial.
