# Hypromellose

**Generic Name:** Hypromellose (also known as Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose)

**Usage:** Hypromellose has a wide range of uses, depending on its formulation and viscosity grade.  These uses include:

* **Ophthalmology:** As an artificial tear substitute to lubricate the eyes and treat dry eye syndrome.  Also used as a viscosity-increasing agent in eye drops containing other medications.
* **Pharmaceuticals:**  As a binder, film former, and tablet disintegrant in oral medications. It can also be used as a sustained-release matrix in drug delivery systems.  It's a common excipient (inactive ingredient) in many tablets and capsules.
* **Food:** As a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier in various food products.
* **Medical devices:** As a component in certain contact lenses and other medical devices.
* **Coatings:**  Forms films in coatings for various applications.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects vary greatly depending on the route of administration and the specific formulation.  Generally, hypromellose is considered well-tolerated. However, some potential side effects include:

* **Ophthalmic use:**  Transient stinging or burning sensation upon application.  Rarely, allergic reactions (such as redness, itching, or swelling) can occur.
* **Oral use:** Generally, no significant side effects are reported as it's usually ingested in small amounts as an inactive ingredient.  However, potential hypersensitivity reactions are possible in rare cases.


**How it Works:** Hypromellose's mechanism of action differs depending on its use:

* **Ophthalmic use:** It acts as a lubricant, coating the surface of the eye and increasing tear film stability. This helps to relieve dryness and discomfort.
* **Pharmaceutical use:**  As a binder, it helps to hold tablets and capsules together. As a film former, it creates a protective coating. As a disintegrant, it helps the tablet or capsule break down and release the medication.  In sustained-release formulations, it controls the rate at which the drug is released.
* **Food use:**  It acts as a thickener by increasing the viscosity of liquids, stabilizing emulsions, and preventing separation of ingredients.


**FAQs:**

* **Is hypromellose a preservative?** No, hypromellose itself is not a preservative.  Preservatives are often added to ophthalmic solutions containing hypromellose to prevent microbial growth.
* **Is hypromellose gluten-free?**  Generally, yes, hypromellose is considered gluten-free. However, always check the specific product label to confirm.
* **Is hypromellose safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** Generally considered safe, but it's always best to consult a doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns.
* **Are there different types of hypromellose?** Yes, different grades of hypromellose exist with varying viscosities and properties, tailored for specific applications.
* **Can I be allergic to hypromellose?** While rare, allergic reactions are possible.  If you experience any unusual symptoms after using a product containing hypromellose, stop use and contact your doctor or pharmacist.
