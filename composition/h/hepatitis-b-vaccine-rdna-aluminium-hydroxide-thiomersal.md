# Hepatitis B Vaccine rDNA + Aluminium Hydroxide + Thiomersal

**Generic Name:** Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)

**Usage:**  Prevention of infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV).  It's recommended for infants, children, adolescents, adults at high risk of infection (e.g., healthcare workers, people with multiple sexual partners, injection drug users), and individuals with chronic liver disease.  The specific vaccination schedule varies depending on age and risk factors and should be determined by a healthcare professional.

**Side Effects:**  Most side effects are mild and temporary.  They may include:

* **Local reactions:** Pain, redness, swelling, or hardness at the injection site.
* **Systemic reactions:** Fatigue, headache, muscle aches, fever, nausea.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  These are uncommon but can occur.  Allergic reactions (ranging from mild rash to anaphylaxis), Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (a rare neurological disorder), and other autoimmune disorders have been reported, though a causal link isn't always established.


**How it Works:**

This vaccine is a recombinant DNA vaccine.  It contains a genetically engineered version of the surface antigen (HBsAg) of the Hepatitis B virus.  This antigen is produced by yeast cells using recombinant DNA technology and is purified to be safe for injection.  The aluminium hydroxide acts as an adjuvant, enhancing the immune response to the antigen. Thiomersal (a mercury-containing preservative) *was* sometimes included in some formulations to prevent bacterial contamination, but many modern formulations are thiomersal-free.  When injected, the HBsAg stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the Hepatitis B virus. These antibodies protect against future HBV infections.


**FAQs:**

* **Is the vaccine safe?**  Yes, the Hepatitis B vaccine is very safe and effective.  Millions of people have received it worldwide.  Side effects are generally mild.
* **Does the vaccine contain mercury?** Some older formulations contained thiomersal as a preservative.  Many modern formulations are thiomersal-free.  Check with your healthcare provider or pharmacist about the specific formulation you are receiving.
* **How effective is the vaccine?**  The Hepatitis B vaccine is highly effective in preventing HBV infection.  The protection rate is typically over 95%.
* **How many doses are needed?**  The number of doses depends on age and other factors.  Infants typically receive a 3-dose series.
* **What if I have allergies?**  Tell your healthcare provider about any allergies you have before receiving the vaccine.
* **Can I get Hepatitis B even after receiving the vaccine?** While rare, it's possible to get a breakthrough infection despite vaccination. The vaccine significantly reduces the risk, however, and the infection may be less severe if it does occur.
* **Is the vaccine effective against all Hepatitis viruses?**  No, this vaccine is only effective against Hepatitis B virus.  Separate vaccines are needed for other types of Hepatitis (e.g., Hepatitis A).
