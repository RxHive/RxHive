# Hydroxyurea

**Generic Name:** Hydroxyurea

**Usage:**

Hydroxyurea is used to treat several conditions, including:

* **Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML):**  It's often used in combination with other medications to manage CML, particularly in patients who are not candidates for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
* **Sickle Cell Anemia:** It reduces the frequency of painful crises by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which helps to prevent red blood cell sickling.
* **Essential Thrombocythemia (ET):**  It helps to lower the high platelet count associated with ET.
* **Melanoma (skin cancer):** In advanced stages, it may be used in combination with other therapies.
* **Head and Neck Cancer:** It's sometimes used in combination with radiation therapy.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* **Nausea and vomiting:** These are relatively common, particularly at higher doses.
* **Headache:**  A frequent side effect.
* **Fatigue:**  Feeling tired and weak.
* **Mouth sores:**  Ulcers or inflammation in the mouth.
* **Skin rash:**  A variety of skin reactions may occur.
* **Low white blood cell count (leukopenia):** This increases the risk of infection.
* **Low red blood cell count (anemia):** This can lead to fatigue and shortness of breath.
* **Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia):** This increases the risk of bleeding.
* **Hair loss (alopecia):**  This is often reversible.
* **Darkening of the skin:**  Hyperpigmentation may occur.

Serious side effects, though less common, include:

* **Severe bone marrow suppression:** This can be life-threatening.
* **Lung problems:**  Including pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of lung tissue).
* **Second cancers:**  There's a slightly increased risk of developing other cancers.


**How it Works:**

Hydroxyurea works primarily by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis.  By reducing DNA synthesis, it:

* **Reduces cell proliferation:** This is beneficial in cancers like CML and melanoma.
* **Increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production in sickle cell anemia:** This helps to alleviate the symptoms of the disease.
* **Lowers platelet production:** This helps manage conditions like essential thrombocythemia.


**FAQs:**

* **Is hydroxyurea chemotherapy?**  Yes, it's considered an antineoplastic (anticancer) drug and a form of chemotherapy.

* **How is hydroxyurea administered?** It's usually taken orally as a tablet.

* **How long do I need to take hydroxyurea?** The duration of treatment depends on the condition being treated and the patient's response. It can range from months to years.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Can I drink alcohol while taking hydroxyurea?**  It's best to avoid alcohol or limit its consumption while on hydroxyurea, as it can increase the risk of some side effects.

* **Can I get pregnant while taking hydroxyurea?** Hydroxyurea is a teratogen (causes birth defects) and should not be taken during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.  Effective contraception is essential.
