# Hydroxyurea
### Generic Name
Hydroxyurea

### Usage

Hydroxyurea, also known as hydroxycarbamide, is a medication with a range of applications. Its primary uses are in treating:

* **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML):** Hydroxyurea is used to manage resistant CML, meaning cases that haven't responded well to other treatments.  It helps control the growth of leukemia cells.

* **Sickle Cell Anemia:**  In sickle cell anemia, hydroxyurea works to reduce the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions, particularly in patients experiencing recurrent, moderate to severe pain crises. It achieves this by increasing the levels of fetal hemoglobin, which helps to improve red blood cell function.


* **Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer:**  Hydroxyurea is used in combination with radiation therapy and other chemotherapy drugs (chemoradiation) to treat certain types of locally advanced head and neck cancers (excluding lip cancer).  It enhances the effects of the radiation.


While less common, hydroxyurea has also been used off-label (meaning not officially approved for this use) in treating other conditions, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), hypereosinophilic syndrome, meningioma, essential thrombocythemia, and polycythemia vera.  The use of hydroxyurea in these conditions should be under the close supervision of a hematologist or oncologist.


### Dosage

Dosage of hydroxyurea varies greatly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, weight, and overall health, as well as response to treatment.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The following information is for general understanding and should not be interpreted as a prescription.

**Adults:** Dosages are typically calculated based on body weight (either ideal or actual, whichever is lower).  Folic acid supplementation is often recommended.  Specific dosages for different conditions are complex and vary significantly.  

* **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML):**  Initial doses may start around 40 mg/kg/day, adjusted based on blood counts.

* **Head and Neck Cancer:** Usually involves higher doses (e.g., 1000 mg every 12 hours) as part of a combination therapy regimen with radiation and other chemotherapy agents.

* **Sickle Cell Anemia:**  Starting doses are typically in the range of 15-20 mg/kg/day, adjusted based on regular blood count monitoring.  The dose may be increased gradually, but only if blood counts remain within acceptable limits to avoid toxicity.



**Children:** Dosage for children with sickle cell anemia usually begins around 20 mg/kg/day, adjusted based on blood counts and response.


**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosages need to be adjusted based on factors such as kidney function (creatinine clearance), liver function, and body weight (especially in obese individuals).  Precise adjustments depend on the specific condition and are determined by the physician.


### Side Effects

Hydroxyurea can cause several side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  Common side effects can include:

* Eczema
* Macrocytosis (abnormally large red blood cells)
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count, a type of white blood cell)
* Bacterial infections
* Headache
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Severe nervous system disorders
* Severe bone marrow suppression
* Pancreatitis
* Pulmonary toxicity (lung problems)
* Skin cancer
* Second malignancies (new cancers)


If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Hydroxyurea's mechanism of action differs depending on the condition being treated.

* **In cancer:** It inhibits an enzyme called ribonucleotide reductase, which is crucial for DNA synthesis. By hindering this enzyme, hydroxyurea interferes with cell division and growth, slowing the progression of cancer cells. It also has a radiation-sensitizing effect.

* **In sickle cell anemia:** Hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), a type of hemoglobin that is less likely to cause sickling of red blood cells. This improves red blood cell function, reducing the severity and frequency of painful crises.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hydroxyurea is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug and those with severe bone marrow suppression.

* **Drug Interactions:** Hydroxyurea can interact with other medications, especially those affecting bone marrow function or liver/kidney function.  Discuss all medications with your doctor.  A specific concern is the potential for fatal pancreatitis when combined with didanosine and stavudine.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Hydroxyurea is a pregnancy Category D drug, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  Women of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for a period afterward.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued while taking hydroxyurea.

* **Other Precautions:**  Regular blood tests are essential to monitor for bone marrow suppression.  Patients should be informed of the increased risk of skin cancer and other malignancies and take necessary precautions (such as sun protection).


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store hydroxyurea?** A: Store hydroxyurea as directed by your pharmacist.  Generally, it should be kept at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I stop taking hydroxyurea if I feel better?** A: No, do not stop taking hydroxyurea without consulting your doctor.  Stopping the medication prematurely can disrupt treatment and may lead to complications.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is nearly time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once. Contact your doctor if you have concerns about missed doses.

* **Q:  Is hydroxyurea addictive?** A: Hydroxyurea is not considered addictive.

* **Q:  What are the long-term effects of hydroxyurea?** A: Long-term use of hydroxyurea can carry risks, including increased risk of malignancy (cancer).  Regular monitoring by a healthcare professional is crucial.
