# Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + sodium perborate monohydrate
### Generic Name

Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) + Sodium perborate monohydrate

**Please Note:** This combination is not a single, FDA-approved drug with a single generic name.  HPMC and sodium perborate monohydrate are separate ingredients often found together in over-the-counter dental and oral hygiene products.  This information is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.  Always follow the instructions on the product label and consult a dentist or doctor if you have concerns.


### Usage

This combination is primarily used in dental and oral hygiene products, particularly those designed for teeth whitening or cleaning.

* **Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC):**  Acts as a thickening agent, binder, and film-forming agent. In dental products, it helps to create a smooth consistency in pastes and gels and can contribute to a protective film on the teeth.

* **Sodium perborate monohydrate:** This is a mild bleaching agent. It releases oxygen, which helps to whiten teeth by breaking down stains on the tooth enamel.  It also has some antiseptic properties.


The combination of HPMC and sodium perborate monohydrate provides both the vehicle (HPMC for the paste or gel) and the active whitening ingredient (sodium perborate).


### Dosage

There is no single "dosage" for this combination as it's used topically in dental products.  The specific amount of each ingredient will vary depending on the manufacturer and the product formulation.  Always follow the instructions on the product packaging for proper use.


### Side Effects

Generally, HPMC and sodium perborate monohydrate are considered safe for topical use in dental products at the concentrations typically employed. However, some individuals may experience:

* **Mild irritation:** Some individuals might experience mild irritation or discomfort in the mouth, such as a slight burning sensation or temporary soreness.  This is usually temporary and resolves quickly.
* **Allergic reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions are possible.  These could manifest as skin rash, itching, or swelling.


**Serious side effects are uncommon** but should be reported immediately to a doctor or dentist if they occur.


### How it Works

* **HPMC:** Works as an inert excipientâ€”a substance that helps to formulate the product into the desired form (e.g., a paste or gel). It does not directly contribute to the whitening effect.

* **Sodium perborate monohydrate:** Releases oxygen when in contact with water.  This oxygen acts as a mild bleaching agent that oxidizes and breaks down colored molecules (stains) on the surface of the teeth, resulting in a whitening effect.



### Precautions

* **Sensitivity:** Individuals with known sensitivities to any component of the product should avoid its use.
* **Pregnant or breastfeeding women:** While generally considered safe, it's advisable for pregnant or breastfeeding women to consult their dentist before using products containing sodium perborate.
* **Dental work:** Individuals with recent dental work (fillings, crowns, etc.) should check with their dentist before using teeth whitening products.
* **Tooth enamel:** Overuse or prolonged use of whitening products can potentially damage tooth enamel.  Follow product instructions carefully.
* **Interaction with other medications:**  There are no known significant interactions between this combination and other medications, but always inform your dentist or doctor of all medications and supplements you use.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is this combination safe for daily use?** A: It's generally safe for occasional use as directed, but daily use might increase the risk of irritation or enamel damage. Follow the product's instructions carefully.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A:  The whitening effect depends on the product's formulation and the individual's teeth. Results may vary.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience irritation?** A: Discontinue use and consult a dentist or doctor.
