# Hydroquinone + Mometasone + Tretinoin
### Generic Name
Hydroquinone + Mometasone + Tretinoin (Triple Combination Cream)

**Note:**  A triple combination cream containing hydroquinone, mometasone, and tretinoin is not a standard, pre-made, FDA-approved formulation.  This combination is often prescribed by dermatologists as a compounded medication, meaning it's mixed specifically according to a doctor's prescription.  Therefore, the exact dosage and formulation will vary depending on the compounding pharmacy and the prescribing physician. The information below provides general information about each component and their potential use in combination, but it's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions exactly if prescribed this combination.  Do not attempt to create this combination yourself.

### Usage

This triple combination cream is primarily used to treat melasma, a common skin condition characterized by brown or grayish-brown patches, usually on the face.  It addresses different aspects of melasma:

* **Hydroquinone:** A skin-lightening agent that inhibits melanin production (the pigment responsible for skin color).
* **Mometasone:** A potent corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and redness associated with melasma.  It also may help with any accompanying itching or irritation.
* **Tretinoin:** A retinoid that promotes cell turnover, helping to exfoliate the skin and improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation.  It also helps to unclog pores.


While primarily used for melasma, a physician *might* prescribe this combination off-label for other hyperpigmentation conditions, but this is less common and only under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

Because this is a compounded medication, there's no standard dosage. The exact strength and amount of each component (hydroquinone, mometasone, and tretinoin) will be determined by your doctor and the compounding pharmacist.  Your prescription will specify the appropriate application frequency (e.g., once daily, twice daily) and duration of treatment.  Generally, it's applied thinly to the affected areas once or twice daily, as directed.  **Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.**

**Oral and IV administration is not applicable for this topical cream.**

### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Skin irritation (redness, burning, stinging)
* Dryness or peeling of the skin
* Increased sun sensitivity
* Itching
* Skin discoloration (temporary or potentially permanent, particularly with hydroquinone)

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing)
* Worsening of existing skin conditions
* Thinning of the skin (with prolonged use of mometasone)
* Purpura (bruising)
*  Striae (stretch marks) (with prolonged use of mometasone)


**If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

This combination works synergistically:

* **Hydroquinone** reduces melanin production, lightening the darkened skin patches.
* **Mometasone** reduces inflammation and redness, improving the overall appearance and reducing discomfort.
* **Tretinoin** increases cell turnover, helping to exfoliate the skin and remove the pigmented cells, accelerating the lightening process and improving skin texture.


### Precautions

* **Sun Sensitivity:**  All three components increase sun sensitivity.  Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days. Avoid prolonged sun exposure.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered under strict medical supervision due to potential risks associated with each component.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor of all other medications you are taking, as interactions are possible.
* **Skin Conditions:**  This combination should be used cautiously in individuals with sensitive skin or existing skin conditions like eczema or rosacea.
* **Long-Term Use:**  Prolonged use of high-potency corticosteroids (like mometasone) can lead to skin thinning and other adverse effects.  Your doctor will likely monitor your treatment closely.
* **Children:** The use of this combination in children requires careful consideration and should only be prescribed by a doctor.
