# Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent Types
### Generic Name
Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent Vaccine (Types 6, 11, 16, 18)

This document provides general information about the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  It is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult your doctor or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or treatment and before undertaking a new health care regimen.

### Usage

The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is used to help protect against the development of certain cancers and genital warts caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18.  

* **Primary Use:**  Prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers, and genital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.  HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for the majority of cervical cancers. Types 6 and 11 are responsible for most genital warts.

* **Secondary Use:** While not its primary purpose, vaccination may offer some degree of cross-protection against other HPV types, reducing the risk of related cancers and diseases.  However, this is not guaranteed.


### Dosage

The recommended dosage varies slightly depending on the specific brand of the vaccine and the age of the recipient.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor and the manufacturer.  Generally:

* **Girls and women aged 9-26:** Typically a three-dose series is recommended. The second dose is administered two months after the first dose, and the third dose is given six months after the first dose.

* **Boys and men aged 9-26:**  Also typically requires a three-dose series, with the same timing as for girls and women.

* **Individuals over 26:**  While not typically recommended for routine vaccination in this age group, some individuals may benefit from the vaccine, depending on their medical history and risk factors. This should be determined through consultation with a doctor.


**Administration:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (by injection into a muscle).

**Other Forms:**  Currently, this vaccine is not available in oral or other forms besides injection.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and temporary.  These may include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Headache
* Fever
* Muscle aches
* Nausea

Less common, but more serious side effects, although rare,  include:

* Allergic reactions (such as difficulty breathing, hives, or swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
* Fainting (syncope)


If you experience any serious or unusual side effects, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

The HPV vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the specific HPV types included in the vaccine (6, 11, 16, and 18).  These antibodies help to prevent infection with these HPV types, thus reducing the risk of developing related diseases and cancers. It is important to note that the vaccine does not treat existing HPV infections.

### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not receive it.
* **Pregnancy:**  The vaccine is generally not recommended during pregnancy.
* **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  Individuals with severely weakened immune systems may have a reduced response to the vaccine.  Their doctor should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits.
* **Interactions:** While interactions with other medications are rare, inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are currently taking.

### FAQs

* **Q:  How effective is the HPV vaccine?**
* **A:** The HPV vaccine is highly effective in preventing infection with the HPV types it covers. However,  it is not 100% effective and does not protect against all types of HPV.

* **Q:  Can I get the HPV vaccine if I'm already sexually active?**
* **A:** Yes, but it is most effective when given before exposure to HPV.  Even if you are sexually active, vaccination can still provide protection against HPV types you haven't yet been exposed to.

* **Q:  Does the vaccine protect against all types of cervical cancer?**
* **A:** No. The quadrivalent vaccine protects against cancers caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, but not all cervical cancers are caused by these types.

* **Q: How is the vaccine stored?**
* **A:**  Always follow the storage instructions provided by your healthcare provider and the vaccine manufacturer. Generally, the vaccine needs to be refrigerated.
