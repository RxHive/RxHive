# Human Normal Immunoglobulin

**Generic Name:** Human Normal Immunoglobulin (HNIG)  *(Note:  There are many brands, but the generic name reflects the core substance.)*

**Usage:**

HNIG is used to treat a variety of conditions involving immune deficiency or autoimmune disorders.  Specific uses include:

* **Primary immunodeficiency diseases:**  Conditions where the body doesn't produce enough antibodies.  This can help prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of infections.
* **Secondary immunodeficiency diseases:**  Immune deficiencies caused by other conditions like cancer, HIV, or certain medications.
* **Autoimmune diseases:**  Conditions where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.  HNIG can help suppress the immune system in these cases. Examples include Kawasaki disease and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
* **Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP):**  A condition where the body destroys its own platelets, leading to easy bruising and bleeding.
* **Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP):** A nerve disorder causing weakness and numbness.
* **Post-exposure prophylaxis for certain infections:**  In some cases, HNIG can be used after exposure to certain viruses (e.g., Hepatitis A, B, measles) to prevent infection.


**Side Effects:**

Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dose administered. Common side effects include:

* **Headache**
* **Fever**
* **Chills**
* **Muscle aches**
* **Nausea**
* **Vomiting**
* **Rash**
* **Injection site reactions** (pain, redness, swelling)
* **Low blood pressure**

More serious, but less common, side effects include:

* **Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)**
* **Kidney problems**
* **Aseptic meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord)**
* **Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)**
* **Thromboembolism (blood clot)**


**How it Works:**

HNIG is a solution containing pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies collected from the plasma of many healthy donors.  This pooled IgG contains a broad spectrum of antibodies against many common infections.  When administered, it boosts the patient's antibody levels, helping them fight off infections or modulate an overactive immune system.  Essentially, it provides passive immunity – the body doesn't produce these antibodies itself, but they are given directly.


**FAQs:**

* **Is HNIG safe?**  HNIG is generally safe, but like all medications, it carries risks.  A healthcare professional should assess potential risks and benefits for each individual patient.  Careful monitoring during and after infusion is crucial.
* **How is HNIG administered?**  It's usually given intravenously (IV) over a period of time, though some formulations can be given intramuscularly.
* **How long does the effect last?** The duration of effectiveness varies depending on the dose, the patient's condition, and the specific use.
* **Are there any drug interactions?**  Yes, there are some potential drug interactions.  A healthcare professional should be informed of all medications the patient is taking.
* **What are the storage requirements?** HNIG must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually under refrigeration.
