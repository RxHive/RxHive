# Hydrocortisone (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Hydrocortisone (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Hydrocortisone ophthalmic is a corticosteroid medication used to treat various inflammatory eye conditions.  Its primary use is in managing steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the eye, including allergic or non-purulent conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eyelid and covering the white part of the eye), blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelids), iritis (inflammation of the iris, the colored part of the eye), herpes zoster ophthalmicus (shingles affecting the eye area), and recurrent marginal corneal ulceration (recurring ulcers at the edge of the cornea).  It's crucial to remember that hydrocortisone ophthalmic is only effective for certain types of eye inflammation and won't work for all conditions.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For ophthalmic inflammatory conditions, the usual dosage is:

* **Ointment (1%):** Apply a small amount of ointment into the affected eye(s) two to four times daily.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Infants and children â‰¤2 years:** The dosage is the same as for adults, but use should be cautious and limited to less than five days.
* **Children >2 years and adolescents:** The dosage is the same as for adults.

**Important Note:**  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in the manufacturer's labeling. Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding dosage and duration of treatment.  Improper use can lead to increased risk of side effects.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Burning sensation in the eyes
* Eye redness
* Watery eyes
* Stinging sensation in the eyes
* Temporary blurred vision

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Secondary eye infections
* Corneal thinning
* Decreased visual acuity (worsening of vision)
* Eye perforation
* Glaucoma
* Ocular hypertension (increased eye pressure)
* Optic nerve damage
* Posterior subcapsular cataract formation
* Visual field defects (including gradual blurring or vision loss, eye pain, nausea, or vomiting)

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, consult your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works
Hydrocortisone ophthalmic is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the eye.  It binds to specific receptors inside cells, leading to changes in gene expression and ultimately reducing the production of inflammatory substances. This process decreases swelling, redness, and other symptoms associated with inflammatory eye conditions.  The exact mechanism is complex, but the end result is a dampening of the inflammatory response, promoting healing and relief of symptoms.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Hydrocortisone ophthalmic is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or any component of the formulation; acute herpes simplex, vaccinia, varicella, and other viral infections of the cornea and conjunctiva; purulent (pus-producing) conjunctivitis or blepharitis and other untreated acute purulent eye infections; ocular tuberculosis; and fungal diseases of the eye.

* **Increased Risk:**  Use may increase the risk of ocular effects and immunosuppression.

* **Use with Caution:** Use cautiously in patients with corneal or scleral thinning, cataract or glaucoma, infections of the cornea or conjunctiva, diabetes, and children aged two years or younger.

* **Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with ophthalmic NSAIDs may enhance the adverse effects of hydrocortisone ophthalmic and delay healing. Close monitoring is advised.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of hydrocortisone ophthalmic during pregnancy and lactation is unknown. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for hydrocortisone ophthalmic to work?**  A: The onset of effect varies depending on the condition being treated.  Improvement may be noticed within a few days, but complete resolution may take longer.

* **Q: Can I use hydrocortisone ophthalmic with contact lenses?** A: No. Contact lenses should be removed before applying hydrocortisone ophthalmic and should not be reinserted until after a significant time has passed to allow the medication to be fully absorbed.

* **Q: How should I store hydrocortisone ophthalmic?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q: Can I stop using hydrocortisone ophthalmic when my symptoms improve?** A: No.  Always follow your doctor's instructions regarding the duration of treatment.  Stopping treatment prematurely may lead to recurrence of the condition.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
