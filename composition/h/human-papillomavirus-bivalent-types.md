# Human Papillomavirus Bivalent Types

**Generic Name:**  There isn't a single "generic name" for bivalent HPV vaccines.  The brand names are Cervarix (no longer widely available) and Gardasil 9 (which is a 9-valent vaccine, not bivalent).  Bivalent HPV vaccines targeted HPV types 16 and 18.  Therefore, a generic name wouldn't be applicable in the same way as for other medications.  We could refer to it generically as "bivalent HPV vaccine".


**Usage:**  Prophylactic vaccination against infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18.  These types are responsible for a significant percentage of cervical cancers and other HPV-related cancers (anal, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal).  The vaccine is typically recommended for pre-teens and teens (ages 9-14) before they become sexually active. It can also be given to individuals up to age 45, though effectiveness may vary depending on pre-existing infection.  The bivalent vaccine is no longer the preferred vaccine due to the availability of the 9-valent option.


**Side Effects:**  Common side effects are generally mild and temporary and include:

* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Headache
* Fever
* Muscle aches
* Nausea

More serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).


**How it Works:** The bivalent HPV vaccine works by introducing inactive (non-infectious) viral proteins from HPV types 16 and 18 into the body. This triggers an immune response, allowing the body to produce antibodies against these specific types of HPV.  If exposed to these HPV types in the future, the body's immune system will be better prepared to fight off infection and prevent the virus from establishing a persistent infection that can lead to cancer.  It does *not* treat existing HPV infections.


**FAQs:**

* **Is the bivalent HPV vaccine still available?**  While it was available in the past, the bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix) is largely discontinued in many countries due to the availability of the more comprehensive 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil 9), which protects against more HPV types.

* **How many doses are needed?** The bivalent HPV vaccine typically requires a two-dose schedule, administered months apart, for those vaccinated at 9-14 years old.  Older individuals may require a 3-dose schedule.  Refer to your doctor for specific scheduling information.

* **Does the vaccine protect against all types of HPV?** No.  The bivalent vaccine only protects against HPV types 16 and 18.  The 9-valent vaccine offers broader protection.

* **Can I get the vaccine if I am already sexually active?** Yes, you can still receive the vaccine even if you are sexually active. However, it may not be as effective if you're already infected with HPV types 16 or 18.

* **Are there any interactions with other medications?** Consult your doctor about potential interactions with other medications or health conditions before receiving the vaccine.

* **Is the vaccine safe for pregnant women?**  The vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.  It is advisable to postpone vaccination until after pregnancy.
