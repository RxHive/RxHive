# Human chorionic gonadotropin hCG

**Generic Name:** Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)

**Usage:**

* **Infertility Treatment:** hCG is used to trigger ovulation in women undergoing fertility treatments like in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI).  It mimics the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that normally triggers ovulation. It's also used to support the corpus luteum (the structure that produces progesterone after ovulation) in early pregnancy.
* **Treatment of Delayed Puberty:** In boys with delayed puberty, hCG can stimulate testosterone production, promoting the development of secondary sexual characteristics.
* **Diagnosis of Certain Conditions:** hCG testing is primarily used to detect pregnancy, but it can also be used to diagnose certain types of tumors (germ cell tumors) that produce hCG.
* **Treatment of Hypogonadism:** In men with low testosterone (hypogonadism), hCG can stimulate testosterone production.


**Side Effects:**

The side effects of hCG can vary depending on the dosage and individual response. Common side effects include:

* **Women:** Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which can range from mild to severe and includes abdominal bloating, pain, and in severe cases, fluid buildup.  Breast tenderness, mood swings, headache.
* **Men:**  Breast tenderness (gynecomastia), fluid retention, acne, headaches.
* **Both Men and Women:**  Pain at the injection site, fatigue, nausea, vomiting.
* **Rare but Serious:** Thromboembolism (blood clots), allergic reactions.


**How it Works:**

hCG is a hormone naturally produced during pregnancy by the placenta.  It has a similar structure to luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  When administered, it binds to receptors on the ovaries and testes, stimulating the production of sex hormones:

* **In women:** It triggers ovulation and stimulates the production of progesterone, crucial for maintaining early pregnancy.
* **In men:** It stimulates the testes to produce testosterone.

Essentially, it mimics the natural hormonal processes involved in reproduction and sexual development.


**FAQs:**

* **Is hCG safe?**  Generally, hCG is considered safe when used under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  However, there are potential side effects, and the risk-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated.
* **How is hCG administered?**  It's typically administered through intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.
* **How long does it take to work?** The effects of hCG vary depending on the usage.  In fertility treatments, ovulation is usually triggered within 24-36 hours of injection.
* **Can hCG be used for weight loss?**  The use of hCG for weight loss is controversial and not supported by robust scientific evidence.  Claims of rapid weight loss through hCG injections are often misleading.
* **What are the potential interactions with other medications?**  hCG can interact with certain medications, so it's important to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **What are the signs of an allergic reaction?**  Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, or dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these.
