# Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG)
### Generic Name
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG)

### Usage
Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) is a hormone used to treat several conditions related to reproductive function and hormone deficiencies.  Its primary uses include:

* **Induction of ovulation in women:** HCG is used to trigger ovulation in women who are not ovulating regularly (anovulation) due to certain secondary causes, not primary ovarian failure.  This is often used in conjunction with other fertility medications like clomiphene citrate or menotropins.
* **Treatment of male hypogonadism:** In men with hypogonadism (testicular failure) secondary to pituitary deficiency, HCG stimulates the testes to produce testosterone, helping to improve symptoms of low testosterone.
* **Treatment of prepubertal cryptorchidism:**  HCG may be used to help the testes descend into the scrotum in prepubertal boys with undescended testicles (cryptorchidism), provided there is no anatomical obstruction.

It's crucial to understand that HCG is a prescription medication used under strict medical supervision and is not a treatment for all forms of infertility.


### Dosage

HCG dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and their response to therapy.  It's always administered by a healthcare professional.  The following are examples and should not be considered definitive dosage instructions:

**Adults:**

* **Ovulation induction (females):** Typically, a single intramuscular (IM) injection of 5,000-10,000 units is given one day after the last dose of other fertility medications (like menotropins).
* **Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (males):**  Dosage regimens vary widely.  One common approach is 500-1000 units IM three times per week for three weeks, followed by twice-weekly injections for three more weeks. Other regimens may involve higher doses over longer periods.

**Children:**

* **Prepubertal cryptorchidism (males):**  Dosage varies depending on age and the physician's approach.  Regimens may involve 4000 units three times a week for three weeks, or 500-1000 units three times per week for several weeks.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Specific adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not explicitly detailed in manufacturer labeling.  Use with caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these side effects is not consistently defined across all studies.

* Headache
* Fatigue
* Irritability
* Depression
* Pain at the injection site


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women: This can be a serious condition involving enlarged ovaries, fluid retention, and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Gynecomastia (breast development in males)
* Thromboembolism (blood clots)
* Precocious puberty (early sexual development in children)
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Rupture of ovarian cysts

**Note:**  If any adverse effects occur, it is crucial to contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

HCG is chemically similar to luteinizing hormone (LH) and human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). It acts by binding to LH receptors in the gonads (testes and ovaries). In women, this stimulates ovulation. In men, it triggers the testes to produce testosterone and other androgens.  It essentially mimics the natural hormonal signals needed for sexual development and reproduction.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** HCG is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication, precocious puberty, certain types of cancers (prostate, breast, or other hormone-sensitive cancers),  and those with malformations of the reproductive organs incompatible with pregnancy.
* **Interactions:** No significant drug interactions are currently known. However, always inform your doctor of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** HCG is categorized as Pregnancy Category X, meaning it poses a significant risk to the developing fetus and should never be used during pregnancy unless specifically directed by a physician under extremely rare circumstances. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution is needed in patients with cardiovascular disease, asthma, a history of migraines, kidney impairment, or seizure disorders.  Formulations containing benzyl alcohol should be avoided in newborns.

### FAQs

* **Q: How is HCG administered?** A: HCG is typically administered via intramuscular (IM) injection by a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see results depends on the condition being treated and the individual's response.  For ovulation induction, the effect is usually seen within days.  For hypogonadism, it may take weeks or months.
* **Q: Can I buy HCG over the counter?** A: No, HCG is a prescription medication and should only be obtained and used under the direction of a healthcare professional.
* **Q: How should I store HCG?** A: Store as directed by the pharmacist, usually refrigerated.
* **Q: Is HCG safe?** A: When used appropriately under medical supervision, HCG is generally safe. However, there are potential side effects, and it's crucial to follow medical advice carefully.
* **Q: Can HCG cause multiple births?** A: When used for ovulation induction, there is an increased risk of multiple births.  This risk is discussed and managed by fertility specialists.
