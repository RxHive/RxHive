# Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate
### Generic Name
Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate

### Usage

Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is a progestin primarily used to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy who have a history of a previous singleton spontaneous preterm birth.  Treatment typically begins between 16 weeks 0 days and 20 weeks 6 days of gestation and continues weekly until 37 weeks of gestation or delivery, whichever comes first.  It's important to note that this medication is *not* intended for women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth beyond a history of prior preterm birth.

Beyond preterm birth prevention, hydroxyprogesterone caproate has other, less common uses:

* **Treatment of advanced uterine adenocarcinoma (stage III or IV):** While approved, chemotherapy is often the preferred treatment for advanced uterine cancer.
* **Management of amenorrhea (primary and secondary) and abnormal uterine bleeding:**  This is used when the bleeding or amenorrhea is due to a hormonal imbalance, *excluding* conditions like fibroids or cancer.
* **Diagnostic test:** It can be used to assess endogenous estrogen production; bleeding 7-14 days after administration indicates the presence of estrogen.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the intended use:

**Preterm Birth Prevention:**

* **Adults (â‰¥16 years):**  Intramuscular (IM) injection of 250 mg once weekly (every 7 days) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection of 275 mg once weekly via an auto-injector.

**Amenorrhea/Abnormal Uterine Bleeding:**

* **Single-dose therapy:** IM injection of 375 mg as a single dose.
* **Cyclic therapy:** IM injection of 250 mg on day 15 of each 28-day cycle for 4 cycles, usually in combination with estradiol valerate.  The starting point for cyclic therapy depends on whether the patient has had recent bleeding.

**Advanced Uterine Adenocarcinoma:**

* **Adults:** IM injection of 1000 mg or more per week (1000-7000 mg/week).  Treatment continues until disease relapse.

**Diagnostic Test for Estrogen Production:**

* **Adults:**  A single IM injection of 250 mg.

**Production of secretory endometrium and desquamation:**  Dosage and scheduling mirrors the cyclic therapy for amenorrhea/abnormal uterine bleeding.

**Pediatric Use:** Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not approved for use in children under 16 years of age.


**Administration:**  IM injections should be administered slowly (at least one minute) into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteus maximus.  Subcutaneous injections via auto-injector are given in the back of the upper arm.  Always follow the specific instructions provided with your prescription.

### How it Works

Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is a synthetic progestin.  The exact mechanism by which it reduces the risk of preterm birth is not fully understood, however it's believed to play a role in stabilizing the pregnancy. In the treatment of uterine adenocarcinoma, it may cause regressive changes in the cancerous cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the medication, current or past history of thromboembolic disorders, breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive cancers, undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding, missed abortion, uncontrolled hypertension, liver tumors, active liver disease, or cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy.  It should not be used as a pregnancy test.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Hydroxyprogesterone caproate can interact with various medications, including anticoagulants, antidiabetic agents, and others.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other drugs you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  It is categorized as Pregnancy Category D. While it's indicated for preterm birth prevention during pregnancy, small amounts may be present in breast milk.  Discuss use during breastfeeding with your doctor.
* **Other Precautions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, depression, conditions exacerbated by fluid retention (such as asthma, epilepsy, or cardiac issues), and neonates (some formulations contain benzyl alcohol).
