# Hydrochlorothiazide + Olmesartan Medoxomil

**Generic Name:** Hydrochlorothiazide/Olmesartan Medoxomil

**Usage:**  This combination medication is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by relaxing blood vessels and helping your body get rid of excess salt and water. Lowering blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems.  It may be used alone or with other medications to control blood pressure.

**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, Hydrochlorothiazide/Olmesartan Medoxomil can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Dizziness:** This is often experienced early in treatment and usually subsides.
* **Headache:**  A common side effect, often mild.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Nausea:**  Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Diarrhea or Constipation:** Changes in bowel habits.
* **Muscle cramps or weakness:**  Especially in the legs.
* **Cough:** In some individuals.

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms like rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience these.
* **Low blood pressure (hypotension):** Dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting.
* **High potassium levels (hyperkalemia):**  Muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat.
* **Kidney problems:**  Changes in urine output, swelling in legs and ankles.
* **Liver problems:**  Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), dark urine.


**How it Works:** This combination medication contains two active ingredients:

* **Hydrochlorothiazide:**  A thiazide diuretic. It works by increasing the amount of water and salt your body excretes in urine. This reduces the volume of blood and thus lowers blood pressure.
* **Olmesartan Medoxomil:**  An angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It blocks the action of a hormone called angiotensin II, which narrows blood vessels. By blocking this hormone, blood vessels relax and widen, lowering blood pressure.

The combination of these two drugs provides a more effective blood pressure reduction than either drug alone.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take this medication with other medications?**  You should inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking, as interactions are possible.  Certain medications, such as potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics, should generally be avoided or used with caution.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  Alcohol can worsen the side effects of this medication, especially low blood pressure. It's best to limit or avoid alcohol consumption.
* **Can I become pregnant while taking this medication?**  This medication is generally not recommended during pregnancy.  Consult your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Mild side effects often resolve on their own. If side effects are severe or persistent, contact your doctor.
