# Hydrochlorothiazide + Olmesartan Medoxomil
### Generic Name
Hydrochlorothiazide + Olmesartan Medoxomil


### Usage

Hydrochlorothiazide + Olmesartan Medoxomil is a combination medication used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's particularly beneficial for patients whose blood pressure isn't adequately controlled with either hydrochlorothiazide or olmesartan medoxomil alone.  This combination therapy offers the advantages of two different mechanisms working synergistically to lower blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic, which helps the body get rid of excess sodium and water, reducing blood volume. Olmesartan medoxomil is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), which works by blocking the effects of a hormone that narrows blood vessels.  By combining these two actions, the medication effectively lowers blood pressure and reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications associated with hypertension, such as stroke and heart attack.  While primarily used for hypertension, this combination might be considered in managing other conditions related to high blood pressure, but this should always be determined by a physician.


### Dosage

Dosage of Hydrochlorothiazide + Olmesartan Medoxomil is determined by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and response.  It's typically available in tablet form for oral administration.  There isn't a standardized pediatric dosage for this specific combination; its use in children is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a pediatric specialist due to limited data.  

* **Adults (Hypertension):**  The usual starting dose is one tablet per day.  The doctor may adjust the dosage upwards depending on blood pressure response and individual tolerance.  Never alter the dosage without consulting a physician.


* **Elderly:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for older adults due to potential decreased kidney function.  A physician will carefully consider this factor when prescribing.

* **Other Considerations:**  Kidney and liver function, as well as other underlying medical conditions, will influence dosage decisions.  A healthcare provider will need to consider these factors when determining the right dosage.  There is no IV formulation of this combination medication.



### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Fatigue
* Dry mouth
* Diarrhea or constipation
* Muscle cramps


Less common, but more serious side effects might include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* High potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Dehydration
* Kidney problems


**Important:** This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication and seek immediate medical attention.



### How it Works

Hydrochlorothiazide + Olmesartan Medoxomil works through a two-pronged approach to lower blood pressure:

* **Hydrochlorothiazide (Diuretic):** Increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body through the kidneys. This reduces blood volume, leading to lower blood pressure.

* **Olmesartan Medoxomil (ARB):** Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict. By blocking angiotensin II, olmesartan medoxomil allows blood vessels to relax and widen, reducing blood pressure.


The combined effect of these two mechanisms leads to a more significant and sustained reduction in blood pressure than either drug alone could achieve.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  This medication is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney or liver disease, anuria (absence of urine production), hypersensitivity to either hydrochlorothiazide or olmesartan medoxomil, or those who are severely dehydrated.  Pregnancy is also a contraindication.


* **Drug Interactions:**  This combination can interact with several other medications, including potassium supplements, ACE inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain heart medications.  Always inform your doctor of all medications and supplements you are taking.


* **Warnings:**  Elderly patients and those with impaired kidney or liver function should be monitored closely.  Patients with diabetes should be aware that this medication may affect blood sugar levels.  Dehydration should be avoided.


* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  This medication is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Consult your doctor about whether it's safe to take during breastfeeding.



### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**  A:  Alcohol can lower blood pressure, so it's best to limit alcohol consumption while taking this medication, as the combination may lead to excessive blood pressure drops.  Consult your doctor.

* **Q:  What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No.  Stopping this medication suddenly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.  Always consult your doctor before stopping treatment.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a severe side effect?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention.
