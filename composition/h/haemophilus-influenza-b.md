# Haemophilus Influenza B
### Generic Name
Haemophilus Influenzae B (Hib) Vaccine

### Usage
The Haemophilus Influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine is primarily used to prevent infections caused by the bacteria *Haemophilus influenzae* type B.  This bacterium can cause serious illnesses, particularly in young children, including meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord), pneumonia (lung infection), epiglottitis (severe throat infection), and bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream).  While the Hib vaccine is primarily given to infants and young children, it may also be recommended for older children or adults with certain conditions, such as those with damaged or removed spleens (e.g., due to sickle cell disease) or those with weakened immune systems (e.g., individuals with HIV).  These individuals are at higher risk for severe Hib infections.

### Dosage

**Infants:** The Hib vaccine is typically administered as a series of shots to infants, starting at 2 months of age and completed by 12-15 months.  The specific schedule and number of doses will vary depending on the vaccine used (some are given as part of combination vaccines) and should be determined by a healthcare provider. Each dose is 0.5 mL given intramuscularly (IM).

**Children (12 months to 5 years):**  Children in this age group who have not received the full course of the Hib vaccine may require one or more doses, depending on their vaccination history. A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage and schedule.  The dose remains 0.5 mL IM.

**Adults and Older Children (Over 5 years):** The Hib vaccine is not routinely given to adults or older children, unless they have specific risk factors as mentioned in the Usage section.  The dosage, if recommended, is typically a single dose of 0.5 mL IM.  Always follow your doctor's recommendation.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Irritability, drowsiness, fever, loss of appetite (anorexia), redness (erythema), swelling, and tenderness at the injection site.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Although rare, serious side effects like syncope (fainting) and seizures have been reported.  Allergic reactions, while uncommon, can also occur.

**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occur after receiving the Hib vaccine, it's crucial to seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works

The Hib vaccine is a type of vaccine that creates immunity against *Haemophilus influenzae* type B bacteria. It works by introducing a weakened or inactive form of the bacteria (or parts of the bacteria) into the body. This triggers the body's immune system to produce antibodies that specifically target the Hib bacteria.  These antibodies provide protection against future infections by recognizing and eliminating the bacteria before they can cause illness.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** The Hib vaccine is contraindicated (should not be given) to individuals who have experienced a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine or to any of its components.
* **Interactions:**  Immunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy, high-dose corticosteroids (used for more than 2 weeks), and radiation therapy can reduce the effectiveness of the Hib vaccine.  Concomitant use is generally not recommended.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The Hib vaccine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning the potential risks to a developing fetus have not been fully established. Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. The excretion of the vaccine in breast milk is unknown; therefore, caution should be exercised.
* **Other Precautions:**  Always inform your healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are currently taking before receiving the Hib vaccine.


### FAQs
