# Hyaluronidase Human, Recombinant
### Generic Name
Hyaluronidase Human, Recombinant

### Usage
Hyaluronidase Human, Recombinant is an enzyme used primarily as an adjuvant to improve the absorption and dispersion of fluids and other injected substances in the subcutaneous tissue.  Its main applications are:

* **Subcutaneous Fluid Administration (Hypodermoclysis):**  It helps to increase the rate and extent of absorption of fluids administered subcutaneously, aiding hydration. This is particularly useful when intravenous access is difficult or impossible.

* **Subcutaneous Urography:**  It facilitates the absorption of radiopaque contrast agents injected subcutaneously, improving the quality of urographic imaging. This is a secondary use, typically employed when intravenous administration is not feasible.

* **Extravasation Treatment:** Hyaluronidase is sometimes used off-label to treat extravasation (leakage) of fluids or medications from a blood vessel into surrounding tissue. It helps disperse the leaked substance, minimizing tissue damage.


### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific application and patient characteristics.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Extravasation:** 50-300 units (often 150 units) are added directly to the injected solution before administration. The exact dose depends on the volume and type of extravasated substance.

* **Hypodermoclysis:**  150 units are injected intradermally prior to subcutaneous fluid administration to facilitate the absorption of 1000 mL or more of fluid.

* **Subcutaneous Urography:** 75 units are injected subcutaneously over each scapula, followed by injection of the contrast medium at the same site.

**Pediatrics:**

Dosage in children varies significantly with age and weight.  Always consult a pediatrician for precise dosing information. General guidelines include:

* **Hypodermoclysis (children ≥3 years):** Hyaluronidase may be added to smaller volumes of subcutaneous fluids (up to 200 mL).

* **Hypodermoclysis (infants and children <3 years):** 200 mL or 25 mL/kg of body weight is a typical starting point. The administration rate should not exceed 2 mL/min.

* **Subcutaneous Urography (children):**  75 units are injected subcutaneously over each scapula, followed by injection of the contrast medium at the same site.

**Administration:**  The method of administration depends on the intended use.  Intradermal injection involves injecting the medication just below the skin surface, while subcutaneous injection goes slightly deeper.  Always follow proper injection techniques to minimize discomfort and risk of complications. A skin test is generally recommended prior to the first administration to check for hypersensitivity. A positive test shows a wheal with pseudopods appearing within 5 minutes and persisting for 20-30 minutes with itching.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are relatively rare but may include:

* Local injection site reactions (e.g., pain, swelling, redness)
* Angioedema (rare but potentially serious swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Urticaria (hives)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild to severe)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, may require immediate medical attention.  Consult a healthcare provider immediately if you experience any adverse effects.


### How it Works

Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, a substance found in connective tissue.  By degrading hyaluronic acid, hyaluronidase increases the permeability of the tissues, allowing for better distribution and absorption of injected fluids and medications. This essentially makes it easier for the injected substances to spread and be absorbed into the bloodstream.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:** Hyaluronidase is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or any of its components.  A skin test is often recommended before the first dose.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Hyaluronidase can interact with several medications, potentially altering their effectiveness or increasing the risk of adverse effects. Consult with a healthcare provider regarding potential interactions with other medications you are taking.  Significant interactions may occur with alpha/beta-agonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids, dopamine, estrogen derivatives and local anesthetics.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Hyaluronidase is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning the risks to a developing fetus are not fully known.  Use during pregnancy should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  It is unknown whether hyaluronidase is excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:**  Careful monitoring is required, especially in patients with impaired kidney or liver function or underlying cardiovascular conditions. Always inform your doctor of your complete medical history before taking this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for hyaluronidase to work?**  A: The onset and duration of effect depend on the dose, the route of administration, and the specific application.  In hypodermoclysis, the effect is typically seen within a short time, facilitating quicker fluid absorption.

* **Q: How is hyaluronidase stored?** A: Store according to the instructions provided on the product packaging.  Generally, it should be refrigerated.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience a side effect?** A:  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.

* **Q: Can I use hyaluronidase without a prescription?** A: No. Hyaluronidase is a prescription medication and should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  It’s important to follow the doctor's instructions carefully.

* **Q: Is Hyaluronidase safe for long-term use?**  A:  The safety of long-term use is not fully established.  It's generally used for specific indications and courses of treatment.  Discuss prolonged use with your healthcare provider.
