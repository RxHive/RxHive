# Hexaminolevulinate
### Generic Name
Hexaminolevulinate

### Usage

Hexaminolevulinate is a contrast agent used primarily in cystoscopic examinations to detect bladder cancer, including carcinoma in situ (CIS).  It's used in patients with suspected or known bladder lesions, either based on previous cystoscopy findings or during surveillance cystoscopy for those with a history of bladder cancer.  It helps highlight cancerous tissue during the procedure, making it easier for the physician to identify and biopsy suspicious areas. Importantly, hexaminolevulinate cystoscopy is *not* a replacement for random bladder biopsies or other standard diagnostic methods for bladder cancer.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Detection of Bladder Cancer):**

*   **Intravesical Instillation:** 100 mg (50 mL) of reconstituted solution is instilled into the emptied bladder via a urinary catheter.

**Pediatric Dosage:**

Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

*   Headache
*   Procedural pain
*   Bladder spasm
*   Bladder pain
*   Dysuria (painful urination)
*   Hematuria (blood in the urine)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

*   Abnormal urinalysis
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Anaphylactoid shock (similar to anaphylaxis)
*   Cystitis (bladder inflammation)
*   Hypersensitivity reactions

If any adverse effects occur, seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works

Hexaminolevulinate enters the cells lining the bladder.  The body uses it to produce protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and other photoactive porphyrins (PAPs). These substances accumulate preferentially in cancerous cells.  During cystoscopy, a special blue light source is used; the PpIX and PAPs in cancerous tissue fluoresce, making the cancerous areas visibly different from healthy tissue under this light. This enhanced visualization aids in the detection of bladder cancer.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

*   Hypersensitivity to hexaminolevulinate, any aminolevulinic acid derivative, or any formulation component.
*   BCG (Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin) immunotherapy or intravesical chemotherapy within the past 90 days.
*   Porphyrias (a group of genetic disorders affecting porphyrin metabolism).
*   Gross hematuria (significant blood in the urine).

**Warnings and Cautions:**

*   Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
*   Use with caution in breastfeeding women; the excretion of hexaminolevulinate in breast milk is unknown.

**Drug Interactions:**

Concomitant use of intravesical BCG may reduce the effectiveness of hexaminolevulinate; avoid concurrent administration.


### FAQs

**Q: How long do I need to keep the solution in my bladder?**

A:  You should retain the solution for at least 1 hour, up to a maximum of 3 hours.  You can move around during this time.

**Q: What type of catheter is used for instillation?**

A:  Vinyl (coated or uncoated), latex, or silicone catheters are appropriate. Avoid catheters coated with silver or antibiotics, and indwelling catheters should only be used if inserted shortly before and removed immediately after the instillation.

**Q: When does the cystoscopy take place?**

A: The cystoscopic exam should begin within 30 minutes of bladder evacuation (but not less than 1 hour and no more than 3 hours after instillation).


**Q: Will this test detect all bladder tumors?**

A: No, hexaminolevulinate cystoscopy may miss some tumors.  It is an adjunct to, not a replacement for, standard cystoscopic procedures, including random biopsies.


**Q: How is the solution stored?**

A: Refer to the specific instructions provided with the medication.  Generally, storage conditions for medications should be followed as indicated on the label.


**Q: What if I have an allergic reaction?**

A: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any allergic symptoms such as rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing or swallowing.
