# Hyaluronidase (Ovine)
### Generic Name
Hyaluronidase (Ovine)

### Usage

Hyaluronidase (ovine) is primarily used as an adjuvant to enhance the absorption and dispersion of other injected medications.  This means it helps other drugs spread more effectively throughout the tissues.  Its primary applications include:

* **Improving the absorption of injected fluids:**  This is particularly useful in hypodermoclysis, a method of administering fluids subcutaneously (under the skin) to treat dehydration. Hyaluronidase increases the rate at which the fluid is absorbed into the body.
* **Enhancing the distribution of radiopaque agents:** In subcutaneous urography, hyaluronidase facilitates better absorption of contrast agents, leading to clearer images during diagnostic procedures.
* **Accelerating the absorption of injected drugs:** In some cases, it can be added to injections of other medications to improve their spread and uptake by the body.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use (dehydration treatment, improving drug absorption, or use in urography) and the patient's age.  Always follow the prescription and instructions provided by your healthcare professional.  Here's a summary based on typical guidelines, but this should **not** replace professional medical advice:

**Adults:**

* **Test dose (for all uses):** An intradermal injection of 0.02 mL (containing 3-4 units of hyaluronidase depending on the brand) is administered to check for allergic reactions. A positive reaction involves a wheal (raised area) with pseudopods (small projections) appearing within 5 minutes and lasting 20-30 minutes, accompanied by localized itching.  Transient erythema (redness) is not considered a positive reaction.
* **Hypodermoclysis (dehydration):** 150-200 units are injected subcutaneously, followed by the administration of at least 1000 mL of isotonic fluid.  Alternatively, it can be added to smaller volumes (up to 200 mL) of subcutaneous fluid.
* **Drug absorption enhancement:** 50-300 units (usually 150 units) are injected subcutaneously, either before or mixed with the drug to be administered.

**Children:**

* **Test dose:** Same as adults.
* **Hypodermoclysis:**  For children under 3 years, the volume of a single clysis should not exceed 200 mL. For children 3 years and older, the rate and volume should not exceed those used for intravenous fluids.
* **Drug absorption enhancement:** 50-300 units (usually 150 units) subcutaneously, either before or mixed with the drug.
* **Subcutaneous urography:** 75 units are injected subcutaneously over each scapula, followed by the contrast medium at the same site. The patient should be prone during administration.


**Important Note:**  The specific dosage and administration method will be determined by a healthcare provider based on individual needs and the specific medication being used in conjunction with hyaluronidase.

### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and infrequent but can include:

* Local injection site reactions (e.g., pain, swelling, redness)
* Edema (swelling)
* Allergic reactions (rare but potentially serious, including angioedema and urticaria)


Less common but potentially serious side effects require immediate medical attention.  If you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, a substance found in the connective tissues of the body.  Hyaluronic acid contributes to the viscosity and density of these tissues. By reducing the hyaluronic acid levels, hyaluronidase increases the permeability of the tissues, allowing for better diffusion and absorption of fluids and other injected substances.  Essentially, it makes it easier for fluids and drugs to spread through the tissues.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:**  Individuals with a known allergy to hyaluronidase or any component of the formulation should not use this medication.  A skin test is usually done before administration in certain situations but not required for extravasation management.
* **Drug interactions:**  Hyaluronidase can interact with various medications, including alpha- and beta-agonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids, dopamine, estrogen derivatives, local anesthetics, phenylephrine, and salicylates.  Consult a doctor about potential interactions if taking other medications.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Hyaluronidase is classified as Category C during pregnancy, meaning its effects are not fully understood.  It may be excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using this medication.
* **Hepatic and renal impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with liver or kidney problems, but monitoring might be necessary.
* **Administration:** Never administer hyaluronidase intravenously (IV) for the labeled uses because it's rapidly inactivated in the blood.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is hyaluronidase stored?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with your specific product. Generally, it should be refrigerated.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor for guidance as this will depend on the reason for its use.
* **Q: Is hyaluronidase safe for long-term use?** A:  The safety of long-term use depends on the specific application and should be determined by a healthcare provider.
* **Q: Are there any alternative treatments?** A:  Yes, alternative treatments exist depending on the condition being treated. Discuss options with your doctor.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any unexpected or concerning side effects.
