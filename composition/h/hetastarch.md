# Hetastarch
### Generic Name
Hetastarch

### Usage
Hetastarch is a plasma volume expander, a type of intravenous (IV) fluid used to increase the volume of blood plasma. Its primary use is as an adjunct in leukapheresis, a procedure to separate white blood cells from the blood.  Here, Hetastarch improves the harvesting and increases the yield of granulocytes (a type of white blood cell) during centrifugation.  It's also used in the treatment of hypovolemia, a condition characterized by low blood volume.  This might occur due to blood loss from trauma, surgery, or other causes.

### Dosage

**Important Note:**  Dosage and rate of infusion depend on the individual's needs, blood loss, hemodynamic status (blood flow and pressure), and the degree of hemodilution (dilution of blood components).  A healthcare professional will carefully titrate the dosage to meet these specific requirements.

**Adults:**

* **Leukapheresis (Granulocyte Yield Increase):** 250-700 mL of 6% Hetastarch (in 0.9% sodium chloride) is added to the input line of the centrifuge apparatus after adding a citrate anticoagulant.
* **Plasma Volume Expansion:** 500-1000 mL or approximately 20 mL/kg as a single dose.  This may be repeated as needed, but the maximum daily dose should not exceed 33-50 mL/kg/day to minimize the risk of accumulation.  It is administered intravenously (IV), either in 0.9% sodium chloride or lactated Ringer's solution.  *Crucially, Hetastarch should not be used in critically ill patients, those with sepsis or septic shock, those undergoing open-heart surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass, or those with pre-existing renal impairment.*

**Children:**

*The safety and efficacy of Hetastarch in children have not been established.* Its use in pediatric patients is generally considered off-label. For severe dehydration in children, crystalloid solutions should be administered first. Use in critically ill children, those undergoing open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, or those with pre-existing renal dysfunction is contraindicated.  When used off-label for plasma volume expansion in children aged 1 year and older, the dosage is typically 10 mL/kg per dose administered intravenously.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  It's contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Renal Impairment:** Avoid use in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.  It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease and oliguria (reduced urine production) or anuria (absence of urine production) not related to hypovolemia.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  The frequency of these side effects isn't consistently defined in the literature.

* Chills
* Headache
* Peripheral edema (swelling)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Pruritus (itching) â€“ often dose-dependent and may be delayed
* Skin rash

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Anaphylactoid reactions (severe allergic reactions)
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
* Cardiac failure
* Hemorrhage (bleeding)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Renal insufficiency (kidney failure)
* Coagulation disorders (problems with blood clotting)
* Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)


If you experience any adverse effects, particularly severe ones, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Hetastarch expands plasma volume due to its colloidal nature. Its large starch molecules remain within the bloodstream, drawing water from surrounding tissues into the vascular space, thereby increasing blood volume. This helps to improve blood pressure and tissue perfusion (blood flow to tissues).

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**

* Hypersensitivity to Hetastarch, hydroxyethyl starch (HES), or any component of the formulation.
* Critically ill adults, including those with sepsis and severe liver disease.
* Renal disease with oliguria or anuria (not related to hypovolemia).
* Any fluid overload condition (e.g., pulmonary edema, heart failure).
* Pre-existing coagulation or bleeding disorders.
* Treatment of lactic acidosis and leukapheresis (for 6% Hetastarch in lactated electrolyte injection only).


**Warnings:**

* Increased risk of life-threatening anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, bleeding, hematologic complications, and fluid overload.
* Use with caution in patients at risk for blood volume overexpansion (very young or elderly patients), those with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, thrombocytopenia, or those whose electrolyte or acid-base balance may be exacerbated.
* Use with caution in breastfeeding women.  Excretion in breast milk is unknown.
* **Boxed Warning:** In critically ill adults, including patients with sepsis, using hydroxyethyl starch (HES) products increases the risk of mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy.  Do not use Hetastarch in these patients.

**Drug Interactions:** Hetastarch may enhance the nephrotoxic effects of arbekacin; avoid using them together.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is Hetastarch stored?** A:  Store Hetastarch according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically at room temperature, protected from light and freezing. Check the specific storage recommendations on the product label.

* **Q: Can I take Hetastarch with other medications?** A:  Inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, to check for potential interactions.

* **Q: Is Hetastarch safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding?** A: The safety of Hetastarch during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Use during pregnancy should only occur when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  Caution is advised during breastfeeding.

* **Q: How long does it take for Hetastarch to work?** A: The effects of Hetastarch are usually seen relatively quickly after administration, but the duration of effect depends on several factors including dosage and the individual's physiological state.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Hetastarch is not typically administered in a regular dosing schedule; it is administered as needed under the direction of a healthcare provider.  Contact your healthcare provider if you have concerns.
