# Histidine
### Generic Name
Histidine

### Usage
Histidine is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot produce it and must obtain it through diet or supplementation.  While it's a building block of proteins, histidine supplementation is primarily used in specific situations.  Its main therapeutic use is in managing rheumatoid arthritis, where it may play a role in modulating the immune response.  It's also sometimes used to address anemia associated with kidney failure or those undergoing kidney dialysis.  However, the evidence supporting these uses is not universally strong, and further research is needed to fully establish its effectiveness.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The typical oral dose of histidine is 4-5 grams per day. However, this dosage is not universally standardized, and individual needs may vary considerably. It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's specific recommendations.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of histidine supplementation in children have not been established.  It should not be given to children without explicit guidance from a pediatrician.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  There's insufficient data to establish safe histidine dosages for individuals with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  The use of histidine in these populations requires extreme caution and close monitoring by a physician.

### Side Effects
* Headaches
* Weakness
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Depression
* Memory problems
* Allergic reactions (including potentially fatal anaphylaxis)


It's crucial to note that these are not all possible side effects.  Serious, though less common, reactions are possible.  If you experience any adverse effects, particularly allergic reactions, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Histidine supplementation may increase the levels of histamine in the body. Histamine has various functions, including immunomodulatory effects (influencing the immune system) and antioxidant activity (protecting cells from damage).  The exact mechanisms by which histidine supplementation benefits rheumatoid arthritis or anemia are not entirely understood and require more research.  It's believed to act indirectly through its role in histamine production and its impact on immune system function.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Histidine is contraindicated (should not be used) in pregnant and breastfeeding women, and those with folic acid deficiency.
* **Increased Risk:**  Histidine use increases the risk of allergic reactions, including the potentially fatal anaphylactic shock.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although specific interactions with other medications haven't been extensively documented, it's advisable to inform your healthcare provider of all medications you are taking before starting histidine supplementation.  This is especially important for those with existing medical conditions.
* **General Precautions:** Using a single amino acid supplement like histidine may create a negative nitrogen balance, impacting metabolism and potentially stressing the kidneys. In children, it might interfere with growth. Long-term, high-dose consumption may lead to psychological disturbances or mood disorders.
