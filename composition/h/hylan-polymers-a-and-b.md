# Hylan Polymers A and B
### Generic Name
Hylan Polymers A and B

### Usage
Hylan Polymers A and B injection is specifically indicated for the management of pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee.  This treatment is reserved for patients who haven't found sufficient relief from non-pharmacologic therapies (like physical therapy) or simple pain relievers (analgesics).  It's a treatment option *after* other, less invasive methods have been tried and proven insufficient.

### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** The safety and effectiveness of Hylan Polymers A and B have not been established in individuals 21 years of age or younger.  For adults with osteoarthritis of the knee who have not responded to other treatments, the typical dosage involves intra-articular (directly into the knee joint) injection. There are two common regimens:

* **Regimen 1:** A single injection of 16 mg (2 mL) weekly for three consecutive weeks (a total of three injections).
* **Regimen 2:** A single injection of 48 mg (6 mL).

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of Hylan Polymers A and B in children have not been established.  Therefore, it is not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended by the manufacturer for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, caution is advised when using this medication in such patients.

### How it Works
Hylan Polymers A and B are derivatives of hyaluronan (sodium hyaluronate), a naturally occurring substance found in the body.  These polymers form a viscoelastic solution that acts as a lubricant and shock absorber within the knee joint. In osteoarthritis, the natural hyaluronic acid in the joint fluid is depleted.  Hylan Polymers A and B replenish this, improving joint lubrication and reducing friction, thereby alleviating pain and improving joint function.

### Precautions
Hylan Polymers A and B are contraindicated in individuals with:

* Known hypersensitivity to hyaluronan or any component of the formulation.
* Active knee joint infection or skin infection at the injection site.
* Hypersensitivity to proteins from gram-positive bacteria.

Caution is warranted in patients with:

* Venous or lymphatic stasis in the leg.
* Hypersensitivity to avian (bird) proteins, feathers, or egg products.

Before injection, the skin should be prepared using a disinfectant *that does not contain quaternary ammonium salts* as these may cause precipitation of the hyaluronate. Synovial fluid or effusion should be removed before injection.  The injection must be administered intra-articularly (into the joint space) and not extra-articularly.  Patients should avoid strenuous activities for 48 hours following the injection.
