# Hydrogen Peroxide
### Generic Name
Hydrogen Peroxide

### Usage

Hydrogen peroxide is primarily used as a topical antiseptic and anti-infective agent. Its applications span various areas:

* **Treatment of raised seborrheic keratoses:**  This involves applying a high-concentration solution directly to the affected skin lesions.  This application should be done by a healthcare professional.

* **Removal of oral secretions:** Lower concentrations are used as a mouth rinse to help clean the mouth and remove excess secretions.

* **Removal of earwax:** Diluted hydrogen peroxide solutions can be used to soften and loosen earwax, aiding in its removal.  This should be done cautiously and under the guidance of a doctor to prevent damage to the ear canal.

* **Treatment of mouth, gum, or dental irritation:**  Lower-concentration solutions or gels can provide temporary relief from minor irritation.

* **Wound cleansing and antiseptic for minor abrasions:** Diluted hydrogen peroxide can be applied to minor cuts and abrasions to help clean the wound and reduce the risk of infection.  It's crucial to use the appropriate dilution to avoid irritation.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use and the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide solution or preparation:

* **Seborrheic keratoses (raised):** A 40% solution is applied topically to lesions four times, approximately one minute apart, during a single treatment session by a healthcare professional.  Repeat applications may be necessary after three weeks if the lesions aren't fully cleared.

* **Removal of oral secretions:** A 1.5% or 3% solution is used as a mouth rinse, up to four times daily. The 3% solution should be diluted with an equal amount of water before use. The 1.5% solution can be used undiluted.

* **Removal of earwax:** A 6% solution is used, diluted to 1 part solution to 3 parts water, instilled into the ear canal.

* **Mouth, gum, or dental irritation:** A 1.4% oral rinse or 1.7% oral gel is used up to four times daily.

* **Antiseptic for minor dermal abrasion:**  A 3% or 6% solution (diluted if 6%), or a 1-1.5% cream or 3% spray is applied to the affected area once or three times daily.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  For children aged 2 years and older, the dosage generally mirrors adult recommendations for oral secretions, mouth/gum irritation, and antiseptic use for minor abrasions, but always under adult supervision and with appropriate dilution as described above.  Always consult a healthcare provider before using hydrogen peroxide on a child.


### Side Effects

* **Common:** Erythema (redness), stinging, skin desquamation (peeling), skin itching, and hyperpigmentation (darkening) or hypopigmentation (lightening) of the skin.  Skin edema (swelling) may also occur.

* **Less Common, but Serious:**  Severe erythema, skin erosion, dermal ulcer, skin atrophy (thinning), and scarring.  Eye irritation or damage can also occur if hydrogen peroxide gets in the eye.

* **Rare (Post-marketing or Case Reports):** Arthropathy (joint problems), eyelid edema, and herpes zoster (shingles) infection.

If any adverse effects occur, discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider.


### How it Works

Hydrogen peroxide is an antiseptic oxidant.  When it comes into contact with tissues, it releases oxygen.  This released oxygen is what kills bacteria through oxidation and cell lysis (destruction). The exact mechanism of action in treating seborrheic keratoses is not fully understood.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hydrogen peroxide should not be injected or instilled into closed body cavities or abscesses.

* **Increased Risk:**  The risk of severe local skin reactions (erosion, ulceration, vesiculation, and scarring) is increased, especially with higher concentrations.  Eye disorders are also a significant risk with accidental eye contact.

* **Use with Caution:** Use with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women.  The systemic absorption of topically applied hydrogen peroxide is minimal, but caution is advised.

* **Drug Interactions:** Taurolidine may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis when used with hydrogen peroxide; therefore, this combination should be avoided.

* **Other Precautions:**  Solutions greater than 3% are irritants and must be diluted before use. Avoid frequent use as a mouthwash to prevent irritation. For wounds, clean the area before applying hydrogen peroxide and apply a sterile bandage after the solution has dried. Do not use for more than a week.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use hydrogen peroxide on deep wounds?** A: No.  Hydrogen peroxide is only for minor cuts and abrasions. For deep wounds, consult a doctor.

* **Q: How should I store hydrogen peroxide?** A: Store hydrogen peroxide in a cool, dark place, away from direct sunlight and heat.  Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is hydrogen peroxide safe for my eyes?** A: No, avoid contact with eyes. If it accidentally gets into your eyes, flush immediately with plenty of water for at least 15-30 minutes and seek medical attention.

* **Q: How long can I use hydrogen peroxide?** A:  Generally, it's not recommended to use hydrogen peroxide for more than a week for any condition.  If your condition doesn't improve or worsens, seek medical advice.

* **Q:  Can I use hydrogen peroxide on my child?** A:  Only with appropriate dilution and under adult supervision, and after consulting a healthcare professional.  It's usually best to consult a doctor before applying it to a child.
