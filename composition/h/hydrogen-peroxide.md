# Hydrogen Peroxide

**Generic Name:** Hydrogen Peroxide

**Usage:**

* **Disinfection:** Hydrogen peroxide is a common antiseptic used to clean minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. It kills bacteria, fungi, and viruses by oxidizing their cells.  It's also used to disinfect surfaces and equipment in medical and industrial settings.  
* **Hair Bleaching:**  A diluted solution is used in hair bleaching products to lift the hair's natural color.
* **Teeth Whitening:** Some toothpastes and mouthwashes contain hydrogen peroxide to whiten teeth.
* **Industrial Use:**  Hydrogen peroxide has numerous industrial applications, including bleaching paper pulp, textiles, and fabrics; water treatment; and as a propellant in rockets.


**Side Effects:**

* **Skin Irritation:**  Direct application of high concentrations can cause burning, stinging, itching, and redness.  Diluted solutions are generally safe for topical use, but sensitive individuals may still experience irritation.
* **Ingestion:** Ingesting hydrogen peroxide can cause severe internal damage, including burns to the mouth, throat, and esophagus.  It can also cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  **Ingestion is extremely dangerous and requires immediate medical attention.**
* **Inhalation:** Inhaling high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide vapor can irritate the lungs and cause respiratory problems.
* **Eye Irritation:** Contact with the eyes can cause significant irritation and burning.
* **Allergic Reactions:** Although rare, some individuals may experience allergic reactions, including skin rashes, hives, or difficulty breathing.

**How it Works:**

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) works primarily as an oxidizing agent.  When it comes into contact with organic material (like bacteria or tissues), it decomposes into water (H₂O) and oxygen (O₂). This release of oxygen is what causes the bubbling effect seen when it's applied to a wound. The oxygen is toxic to many microorganisms, disrupting their cellular processes and leading to their death.  In hair bleaching, the oxygen bleaches the melanin pigment.  In teeth whitening, it oxidizes stains, making them less visible.


**FAQs:**

* **Is hydrogen peroxide safe for open wounds?** Diluted solutions (3%) are generally safe for cleaning minor cuts and scrapes.  However, it's not recommended for deep wounds or severe injuries.  Always consult a healthcare professional for significant wounds.
* **Can I use hydrogen peroxide to clean a contact lens case?** No. Hydrogen peroxide can damage the lens case and potentially harm your eyes if traces remain. Use sterile saline solution instead.
* **Can I drink hydrogen peroxide?** **Absolutely not.** Ingesting hydrogen peroxide is extremely dangerous and can cause serious internal damage.  Never consume hydrogen peroxide under any circumstances.
* **What concentration of hydrogen peroxide should I use?** For minor cuts and scrapes, a 3% solution is typically used.  Higher concentrations can cause significant tissue damage.
* **What should I do if I accidentally ingest or inhale hydrogen peroxide?** Seek immediate medical attention.  Contact poison control or emergency services.
