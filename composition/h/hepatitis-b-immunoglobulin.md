# Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin
### Generic Name
Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG)

### Usage

Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) is a crucial medication used primarily for preventing hepatitis B infection after exposure to the virus.  Its main uses include:

* **Postexposure prophylaxis:** This is the most common use. HBIG is given to individuals who have had contact with blood, bodily fluids (especially blood), or other materials potentially containing the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), such as through needle-stick injuries, sexual contact, or perinatal exposure (mother to child).  The goal is to provide immediate passive immunity to reduce the risk of infection.

* **Perinatal prophylaxis:**  Infants born to mothers with HBsAg-positive status are at high risk of contracting hepatitis B. HBIG, administered shortly after birth, is a critical component of their preventative care alongside the hepatitis B vaccine.

* **Prevention of recurrence after liver transplant:** In individuals who have had a liver transplant and are HBsAg-positive, HBIG can help prevent the recurrence of hepatitis B infection. This is given as a part of a comprehensive post-transplant treatment strategy.

It's crucial to understand that HBIG is *not* a treatment for active hepatitis B infection or chronic hepatitis B. It only offers protection against the virus.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the reason for administration, the patient's age, and the route of administration (intramuscular [IM] or intravenous [IV]).  Consult the prescribing information for precise dosage, but here is a summary:

**Adults:**

* **Postexposure prophylaxis (IM):**  A single dose of 0.06 mL/kg is usually administered within 24 hours (or up to 7 days for needle-stick injuries, up to 14 days for sexual contact) of exposure.  A second dose might be given a month later in certain situations.  Specific protocols exist for healthcare professionals exposed to HBsAg.

* **Prevention of recurrence after liver transplant (IV):** This is a much higher dose regimen involving multiple IV doses over several months. The specific dosing schedule is complex and must be determined by a physician specialized in liver transplantation and should be carefully followed.


**Children:**

* **Perinatal exposure prophylaxis (IM):** A single 0.5 mL dose is given within 12 hours of birth to infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.  Additional doses may be necessary depending on the vaccination schedule.

* **Postexposure prophylaxis (IM):** Infants under 12 months receive a 0.5 mL dose as soon as possible after exposure.  Children 12 months and older receive dosages similar to adults, adjusted for weight.

**Important Note:** The information above is a simplified overview.  Precise dosage and administration must be determined by a healthcare professional, based on the individual patient's situation.


### Side Effects

Common side effects are generally mild and can include:

* Headache
* Malaise (general discomfort)
* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Muscle aches
* Joint stiffness

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Anaphylactic reaction (severe allergic reaction) – requires immediate medical attention.
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Changes in blood cell counts

If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

HBIG contains antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).  These antibodies are sourced from the blood of people with high levels of these protective antibodies.  When administered to an individual exposed to HBsAg, these antibodies bind to the virus, effectively neutralizing it and preventing it from infecting liver cells.  This provides passive immunity—immediate but temporary protection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** HBIG is contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to human immunoglobulins or those with isolated IgA deficiency.

* **Interactions:**  Live vaccines should not be given simultaneously with or shortly after HBIG because it can interfere with the vaccine's effectiveness.  There is a recommended waiting period before live vaccines can be administered.

* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  HBIG is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it should be used only when clearly indicated and under close medical supervision.

* **Renal and hepatic impairment:**  There is no specific dosage adjustment recommendation from manufacturers for people with kidney or liver problems, but caution should be exercised and a healthcare professional should always be consulted.

* **Thromboembolic risk:** There is a risk of blood clots and thrombosis. Careful monitoring is needed in those with pre-existing conditions.

* **Viral transmission:**  Although rigorous screening and testing is done to minimize risk, there's still a theoretical possibility of transmitting other blood-borne viruses.


### FAQs

* **How long does the protection from HBIG last?**  The protection provided by HBIG is temporary, usually lasting only a few weeks to a few months.

* **Can I take HBIG with other medications?**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, to assess for potential interactions.

* **How is HBIG stored?**  HBIG must be stored according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically refrigerated.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Contact your healthcare provider immediately to discuss what steps to take.

* **Is HBIG safe for everyone?**  While generally safe, some individuals are at higher risk of adverse effects, and caution is necessary in certain situations. Discuss any health concerns with your healthcare professional before receiving HBIG.
