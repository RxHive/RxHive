# Hydralazine

**Generic Name:** Hydralazine

**Usage:**

Hydralazine is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).  It's often used in combination with other blood pressure medications, especially in severe hypertension or when other medications haven't been effective enough on their own.  It's also sometimes used to treat heart failure, specifically to improve symptoms in people with systolic heart failure who have not responded adequately to other therapies.  The use in heart failure is less common than its use for hypertension.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Headache:** This is a frequent side effect.
* **Nausea:** Some individuals experience nausea.
* **Dizziness:** Lightheadedness or dizziness can occur, especially when starting the medication or increasing the dose.
* **Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia):**  The heart may beat faster than usual.
* **Flushing (reddening of the skin):** This is a common and characteristic side effect.
* **Shortness of breath:**  Difficulty breathing may occur in some cases.

Less common, but more serious side effects can include:

* **Lupus-like syndrome:** This is a rare but serious side effect that mimics the autoimmune disease lupus. Symptoms can include fever, joint pain, chest pain, and inflammation of the lungs and kidneys.  This is more likely with long-term use and higher doses.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:**  Nerve damage in the extremities, leading to numbness, tingling, or pain.
* **Fluid retention (edema):** Swelling in the ankles, feet, or legs.
* **Angina:** Chest pain.


**How it Works:**

Hydralazine is a vasodilator, meaning it relaxes and widens blood vessels.  By widening the blood vessels, it reduces the resistance to blood flow, which lowers blood pressure.  It primarily affects arterioles (small arteries), causing dilation and decreasing peripheral vascular resistance.  The exact mechanism by which it causes vasodilation is complex and not fully understood, but it's thought to involve interactions with calcium channels and nitric oxide pathways.


**FAQs:**

* **Can I take hydralazine with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, and supplements, as interactions can occur.
* **How long does it take to work?** The blood pressure-lowering effect of hydralazine typically begins within 30 to 60 minutes of taking a dose, but it may take several weeks for the full effect to be seen.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.
* **Can I stop taking hydralazine suddenly?**  No, you should not stop taking hydralazine suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly can lead to a rebound increase in blood pressure.
* **Can hydralazine cause weight gain?**  While not a common side effect, some individuals may experience fluid retention, which can contribute to weight gain.
* **Is hydralazine safe during pregnancy?**  Hydralazine should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks.  It's crucial to discuss this with your doctor.
* **What are the long-term effects of hydralazine?** Long-term use can increase the risk of developing a lupus-like syndrome, although this is relatively rare.  Regular monitoring by your doctor is essential.
