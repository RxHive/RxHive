# Hydralazine
### Generic Name
Hydralazine

### Usage
Hydralazine is primarily used to treat moderate-to-severe hypertension (high blood pressure).  It acts as a direct-acting vasodilator, meaning it relaxes blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure.  While its primary use is in hypertension, it also has off-label uses, such as in the management of hypertensive emergencies (including those in pregnant women), perioperative hypertension (high blood pressure during or after surgery), and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in conjunction with other medications.  The off-label uses should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.

* **Hypertension (moderate-to-severe):** Oral administration typically starts at 10 mg four times daily (QID) for 2-4 days, increasing to 25 mg QID for the rest of the week.  The dose is then titrated (adjusted) upward, as needed, up to a maximum of 300 mg/day in divided doses.  
* **Hypertensive Emergency:**  Intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration is used in emergency situations.  The usual dose is 10-20 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, with a maximum dose of 40 mg per dose.
* **Perioperative Hypertension:** IV administration is used, typically 5-20 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.
* **Heart Failure (HFrEF - Off-label):**  Oral hydralazine is used in combination with isosorbide dinitrate.  Dosage is typically started low (25-50 mg three or four times daily) and titrated upward every 2-4 weeks as tolerated, up to a maximum of 300 mg/day, in conjunction with isosorbide dinitrate.
* **Hypertensive Emergency in Pregnancy (Off-label):**  IM or IV administration; the dose is usually 5-10 mg, repeated every 20 minutes as needed if blood pressure remains elevated.  If the blood pressure remains high after a total cumulative dose of 20-30 mg, alternative medications are necessary.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Pediatric dosages are significantly lower than adult dosages and are strictly determined by weight and the specific condition.  A physician will calculate the appropriate dosage based on these factors for heart failure and hypertension.  Always follow the doctor's prescribed regimen.  Never administer pediatric dosages to adults.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Consult your doctor for guidance on appropriate dosage modification based on your individual health status.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing (reddening of the skin)
* Nausea
* Palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Lupus-like syndrome (symptoms resembling lupus)
* Agranulocytosis (severe decrease in white blood cells)
* Hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells)
* Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
* Peripheral neuritis (nerve damage in the extremities)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works
Hydralazine directly relaxes the smooth muscles in the walls of arteries, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This reduces the resistance to blood flow, lowering blood pressure.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood but involves influencing calcium levels and myosin phosphorylation within arterial smooth muscle cells.  It also indirectly affects the renin-angiotensin system, although this isn't the primary mechanism for its blood pressure-lowering effect.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hydralazine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug, certain heart conditions (e.g., mitral valve rheumatic heart disease, coronary artery disease), lupus, and certain types of heart failure.
* **Drug Interactions:** Hydralazine can interact with other medications, particularly other antihypertensive drugs, MAO inhibitors, NSAIDs, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Hydralazine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Use during pregnancy should only occur under strict medical supervision. It's excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised during breastfeeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  Renal or hepatic impairment may require dosage adjustments.  Older adults are more susceptible to side effects, and close monitoring is recommended.  Children's dosage needs to be adjusted based on weight.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking hydralazine suddenly?** A: No, stopping hydralazine abruptly can cause a rebound effect, leading to a rapid increase in blood pressure. Always taper off under your doctor's supervision.
* **Q: How should I store hydralazine?** A: Store hydralazine at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Never double the dose.
* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking hydralazine?** A: Alcohol can increase the risk of low blood pressure.  Limit alcohol consumption while on this medication.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q:  Is hydralazine addictive?** A: No, hydralazine is not considered an addictive substance.
