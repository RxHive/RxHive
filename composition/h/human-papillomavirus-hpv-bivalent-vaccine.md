# Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Bivalent Vaccine
### Generic Name
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Bivalent Vaccine

### Usage
The HPV bivalent vaccine is primarily used to prevent infections caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18.  These two HPV types are responsible for a significant percentage of cervical cancers, as well as other cancers such as anal, vaginal, vulvar, and oropharyngeal cancers.  The vaccine aims to prevent the development of these cancers and precancerous lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) associated with HPV 16 and 18.

### Dosage

**Adults (Females ≤ 45 years):**  The recommended dosage is a 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection administered in a 3-dose series.  The first dose is given at the initial visit, the second dose is given 1-2.5 months after the first, and the third dose is given 5-12 months after the first.

**Pediatric and Adolescent Females:** The recommended dosage varies by age and immunocompromised status.

* **Non-immunocompromised patients (≥9 years):**  A 2-dose series (0.5 mL IM at 0 and 6-12 months) is recommended for those aged 9-14 years. For those 15 years and older, a 3-dose series (0.5 mL IM at 0, 1-2 months, and 6 months) is recommended.  Vaccination at ages 11-12 is preferred.  In cases of sexual abuse or assault history, vaccination may start at age 9.
* **Immunocompromised patients (≥9 years):** A 3-dose series (0.5 mL IM at 0, 1-2 months, and 6 months) is recommended regardless of age.

**Catch-up Immunization:** If a patient has received some doses of the vaccine, the series is *not* restarted.  The remaining doses should be administered according to the schedule appropriate for the patient's age and immunocompromised status, ensuring appropriate intervals between doses.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustments are necessary based on hepatic or renal impairment according to the manufacturer's labeling.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Fatigue
* Pain, erythema (redness), and swelling at the injection site
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)

**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Urticaria (hives)
* Injection site pruritus (itching)
* Vaginal infection
* Influenza-like illness
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Pharyngolaryngeal pain
* Pharyngitis (sore throat)

**Rare but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing and/or case reports):**

* Anaphylactoid reaction
* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Erythema multiforme
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Induration at injection site
* Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes)
* Paresthesia (numbness or tingling)
* Syncope (fainting), potentially with seizure-like activity
* Vasodepressor syncope

**Important Note:**  Any significant or concerning side effect should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
The HPV bivalent vaccine is an inactivated vaccine containing virus-like particles (VLPs) of HPV types 16 and 18. These VLPs are essentially empty shells of the virus that cannot cause infection.  When administered, the vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against HPV 16 and 18. These antibodies provide protection against infection by these HPV types, thus reducing the risk of developing related cancers and precancerous lesions.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine.

**Interactions:**  Concomitant use with certain medications, such as belimumab, fingolimod, immunosuppressants (excluding liposomal cytarabine), and venetoclax, may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine.  Consult a healthcare professional regarding potential drug interactions.

**Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, syncope, and shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. Patients with bleeding disorders should be monitored closely.  Avoid pregnancy for two months following vaccination.  The vaccine is not recommended for use during pregnancy.  Breastfeeding is not affected by the vaccine.

**Vulnerable Groups:**  Pregnant women should not receive the vaccine. The vaccine is generally safe for children and older adults within the recommended age ranges. Immunocompromised individuals might have a reduced immune response; however, vaccination is still recommended following consultation with a healthcare provider.


### FAQs

* **Q: Is the HPV vaccine safe?** A:  Extensive research shows the HPV vaccine is safe and highly effective.  Like all vaccines, there is a potential for side effects, but most are mild and temporary.
* **Q: How long does the protection last?** A: The duration of protection is still being studied, but current evidence suggests it provides long-term protection.
* **Q: Does the vaccine prevent all types of HPV?** A: No, this bivalent vaccine protects against HPV types 16 and 18.  Other vaccines protect against a wider range of HPV types.
* **Q:  Do I need to get tested for HPV before getting the vaccine?** A:  No, pre-vaccination HPV testing is not necessary.  Regular cervical cancer screening is still recommended following vaccination.
* **Q: Can I get the vaccine if I'm already sexually active?** A: Yes, the vaccine can still be beneficial even if you are sexually active.  It helps prevent future infections with the targeted HPV types.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a severe side effect?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately.
