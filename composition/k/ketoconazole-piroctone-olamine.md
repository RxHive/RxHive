# Ketoconazole + Piroctone Olamine

**Generic Name:** Ketoconazole + Piroctone Olamine

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used topically (applied to the skin) to treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. It's effective against both *Malassezia globosa* (a yeast implicated in these conditions) and *Staphylococcus aureus* (a bacteria that can exacerbate these conditions).  Specific product formulations may vary slightly in their intended use.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site. These may include:

* **Irritation:** Redness, itching, burning, or stinging at the application site.
* **Dryness:** Dryness or flaking of the skin.
* **Allergic reactions:**  In rare cases, an allergic contact dermatitis may occur, manifested as a more severe rash, swelling, or blistering.


**How it Works:**

* **Ketoconazole:** This is an antifungal medication. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By disrupting the fungal cell membrane, ketoconazole prevents fungal growth and reproduction.

* **Piroctone Olamine:** This is an antimicrobial agent with both antifungal and antibacterial properties. Its exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood, but it's believed to disrupt the fungal cell membrane and interfere with fungal metabolism, inhibiting their growth.  It also has some activity against bacteria like *Staphylococcus aureus*.

The combination of ketoconazole and piroctone olamine provides broader coverage against both fungal and bacterial components often contributing to dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.
