# Ketoprofen

**Generic Name:** Ketoprofen

**Usage:** Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its uses include:

* **Pain relief:**  It's effective for mild to moderate pain from various sources, such as headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, dental pain, and post-surgical pain.
* **Inflammation reduction:**  It reduces swelling, redness, and pain associated with inflammatory conditions like arthritis (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), bursitis, and tendinitis.


**Side Effects:** Like other NSAIDs, ketoprofen can cause several side effects, ranging from mild to severe.  These include:

* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache.
* **Less common but potentially serious side effects:**  Stomach ulcers or bleeding, kidney problems, liver problems, increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially with long-term use or high doses), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), fluid retention.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), serious gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis.


**How it Works:** Ketoprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that trigger pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, ketoprofen alleviates pain and inflammation.
