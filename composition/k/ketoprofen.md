# Ketoprofen
### Generic Name
Ketoprofen

### Usage
Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.  Its main applications include treating various painful conditions such as:

*   **Osteoarthritis:**  A degenerative joint disease causing pain and stiffness.
*   **Periarthritis of the shoulder:** Inflammation of the tissues surrounding the shoulder joint.
*   **Tendinitis, tenosynovitis, peritendinitis:** Inflammation of tendons and tendon sheaths.
*   **Humeral epicondylitis:**  Inflammation of the tendons around the elbow (tennis elbow or golfer's elbow).
*   **Primary dysmenorrhea:** Painful menstruation.
*   **Muscle pain:**  Pain stemming from muscle injuries or strains.
*   **Pain after trauma:** Pain resulting from injuries like sprains or fractures.
*   **Ankylosing spondylitis:** A type of inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine.


While less common, ketoprofen may also be used off-label for other pain conditions.  Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriateness of ketoprofen for a specific condition.

### Dosage
Ketoprofen dosage varies significantly depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration (oral, intramuscular, rectal, topical), and the patient's characteristics (age, weight, renal or hepatic function).  The information below is for guidance only; *always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.*

**Adults:**

*   **Oral (immediate-release):** Dosages typically range from 25-75 mg every 6-8 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 300 mg.  Specific dosages will depend on the condition.
*   **Oral (enteric-coated/extended-release):** These formulations are usually not recommended for acute pain and have different dosage regimens, often involving lower daily doses than immediate-release formulations.
*   **Rectal (suppository):**  One suppository may be administered once or twice daily, sometimes in combination with oral doses. The maximum combined daily dose (oral and rectal) is typically 300 mg.
*   **Intramuscular (injection):** Usually 100 mg per day, divided into one or two doses.  Intramuscular administration is generally for short-term use for severe pain and should transition to oral therapy as soon as possible.
*   **Topical (gel or plaster):**  Application instructions vary depending on the specific product, with multiple applications daily being common.  The amount applied depends on the size of the affected area.


**Children:**

Dosage for children is strictly determined by a physician based on the child's weight and condition.  It is generally calculated as 0.5 mg/kg every 4-8 hours, up to a maximum of 2 mg/kg per day. Oral solutions or syrups are commonly used.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with impaired liver or kidney function.  These adjustments are usually made by a physician to minimize the risk of adverse effects.


### Side Effects

**Common side effects:**

*   Dyspepsia (indigestion)
*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea
*   Abdominal pain
*   Constipation or diarrhea
*   Abnormal liver function test results
*   Skin rash

**Less common, but serious side effects:**

*   Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration
*   Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*   Kidney problems
*   Liver damage
*   Cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke)


If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking ketoprofen and contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Ketoprofen is an NSAID that works by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that cause inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, ketoprofen decreases inflammation and relieves pain.

### Precautions

*   **Allergic reactions:** Ketoprofen should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to ketoprofen, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.  A history of asthma, hives, or allergic reactions to these medications is a strong contraindication.
*   **Gastrointestinal problems:** Ketoprofen can increase the risk of stomach ulcers, bleeding, and perforation. This risk is higher in elderly individuals and those with a history of gastrointestinal problems.  Take ketoprofen with food to lessen this risk.
*   **Cardiovascular risks:**  Ketoprofen, like other NSAIDs, can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. This risk is higher with prolonged use and in individuals with existing cardiovascular risk factors.
*   **Kidney and liver problems:** Ketoprofen can affect kidney and liver function.  Dosage adjustments may be required for those with pre-existing kidney or liver disease.
*   **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:** Ketoprofen is generally avoided during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, and during breastfeeding.
*   **Drug interactions:** Ketoprofen can interact with other medications, including anticoagulants, blood thinners, and certain diuretics.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
*   **Other precautions:** Avoid alcohol while taking ketoprofen. Avoid sun exposure while using topical ketoprofen to minimize the risk of photosensitivity.
