# Ketorolac
### Generic Name
Ketorolac

### Usage
Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for short-term management of moderate to severe pain.  Its primary use is for post-operative pain relief, particularly following surgical procedures.  It's also sometimes used to treat acute pain associated with other conditions, but its use should be limited to short-term treatment due to its potential for side effects.  While it possesses anti-inflammatory properties, it's less frequently prescribed for chronic inflammatory conditions compared to other NSAIDs.  Its use in these situations should be carefully considered and only under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

Dosage varies considerably depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of the pain, and always needs to be determined by a physician.  It's crucial to follow prescribed instructions precisely.  Here's a general overview, but this is *not* a substitute for medical advice:

* **Oral:**  For adults, the typical starting dose is 10 mg every 4 to 6 hours.  The maximum daily dose is typically 40 mg.  Ketorolac oral formulations are usually tablets or capsules.  Pediatric use of oral Ketorolac is generally not recommended.

* **Intravenous (IV):**  For adults, the initial dose is usually 10 to 30 mg, followed by 10 to 15 mg every 6 hours as needed.  Again, the maximum daily dose should not exceed 40 mg.  Ketorolac is administered intravenously only in a clinical setting under medical supervision.  Pediatric IV use of Ketorolac is not generally recommended.


**Important Note:**  The information above is for general understanding only.  Dosage must always be determined and adjusted by a healthcare professional based on individual needs and tolerance.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness.

* **Less Common, but Serious Side Effects:**  Kidney problems (including acute kidney failure), stomach ulcers, bleeding in the stomach or intestines, increased risk of heart attack or stroke (particularly with long-term use or in individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors), allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis), fluid retention, high blood pressure.

If you experience any concerning side effects, particularly those listed above, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works

Ketorolac works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are substances in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, ketorolac helps to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation at the site of injury or surgery.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ketorolac should not be used in patients with known allergy to ketorolac or other NSAIDs, individuals with severe kidney or liver disease, active peptic ulcers, or a history of bleeding disorders.  It is also generally avoided in patients who are severely dehydrated.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ketorolac can interact with various medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), other NSAIDs, aspirin, and certain diuretics.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements.

* **Special Populations:**  Caution is advised in elderly patients, individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and those with a history of asthma or allergic conditions.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under the direction of a physician, as risks may outweigh benefits.

* **Safety Measures:**  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking ketorolac.  It's essential to avoid driving or operating machinery if you experience dizziness or drowsiness.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long can I take ketorolac?**  A: Ketorolac is intended for short-term use only, typically no longer than 5 days.  Longer use increases the risk of serious side effects.

* **Q: Can I take ketorolac with other pain relievers?**  A:  Discuss with your doctor before combining ketorolac with other pain medications, as interactions can occur.

* **Q: How should I store ketorolac?**  A: Store ketorolac at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**  A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.

* **Q: Is ketorolac addictive?**  A:  Ketorolac is not considered an addictive substance in the same way as opioids.  However, long-term use should be avoided to minimize the risk of adverse effects.
