# Ketorolac

**Generic Name:** Ketorolac tromethamine

**Usage:** Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve moderate to moderately severe pain. It's often used for short-term pain management (typically up to 5 days) following surgery, dental procedures, or acute injury.  It's available as tablets, oral solutions, and injectable forms.  **It is NOT intended for long-term use.**

**Side Effects:**  Ketorolac, like other NSAIDs, can cause a range of side effects, some common and some serious.  These include:

* **Common:**  Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Increased risk of bleeding (especially in the stomach or intestines), ulcers, kidney problems (including acute kidney failure, especially in dehydrated individuals or those with pre-existing kidney disease), high blood pressure, fluid retention, heart problems (including heart attack and stroke - increased risk with long-term use), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing - seek immediate medical attention if this occurs), increased risk of infection.
* **Rare but Serious:** Liver damage, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).

**How it Works:** Ketorolac works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, it helps alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take Ketorolac with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, before taking Ketorolac.  Interactions can occur with blood thinners (like warfarin), other NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and certain antidepressants, among others.
* **How long can I take Ketorolac?**  Ketorolac is generally only intended for short-term use (up to 5 days).  Longer use increases the risk of serious side effects.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking Ketorolac?** Alcohol can increase the risk of stomach upset and bleeding.  It's best to avoid alcohol while taking Ketorolac.
* **Is Ketorolac safe for everyone?** Ketorolac is not suitable for everyone.  People with certain medical conditions (such as kidney or liver disease, bleeding disorders, ulcers, asthma, or a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs) should not take it.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before taking Ketorolac.  It's also generally not recommended for children or adolescents.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking Ketorolac and contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
