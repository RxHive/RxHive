# Ketotifen (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Ketotifen (Ophthalmic)

### Usage

Ketotifen ophthalmic solution is primarily used for the temporary relief of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.  Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye) caused by an allergic reaction, often to pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.  The medication works to prevent the itching, a key symptom of this condition.  It's important to note that Ketotifen ophthalmic does *not* treat the underlying allergy; it only manages the symptom of itching.


### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Allergic Conjunctivitis):**

*   Instill one drop of 0.025% or 0.035% Ketotifen ophthalmic solution into the affected eye(s) twice daily (BID), every 8-12 hours.  
*   Do not exceed two applications per day.


**Pediatric Dosage (Allergic Conjunctivitis):**

*   For children aged 3 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults.  Use should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment. However, due to the low systemic absorption of ophthalmic Ketotifen, adjustments are likely unnecessary.  Always consult with a doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns about kidney or liver function.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

*   Headache
*   Conjunctival injection (redness in the eye)

If you experience any of these side effects, particularly if they are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ketotifen ophthalmic solution works in two ways:

1.  **Histamine Antagonist:** It blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction that causes itching and inflammation.  It does this by competitively binding to the H1-receptor, preventing histamine from triggering its effects.
2.  **Mast Cell Stabilizer:** It inhibits the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells. Mast cells are immune cells that play a crucial role in allergic reactions. By stabilizing them, Ketotifen reduces the overall inflammatory response.


This dual mechanism makes Ketotifen effective in preventing the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Ketotifen ophthalmic is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Ketotifen or any components of the formulation.
*   **Contact Lens Wearers:** Use caution in contact lens wearers.  Remove soft contact lenses before application and wait at least 10 minutes (if the formulation contains benzalkonium chloride) before reinserting.  Avoid wearing contact lenses if your eyes are red or irritated.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ketotifen is categorized as pregnancy category C.  This means that studies in animals have shown adverse effects, and there are no adequate studies in pregnant women.  The drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit clearly outweighs the potential risks. Excretion into breast milk is unknown; therefore, use with caution during breastfeeding.  Always consult with your doctor before using any medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
*   **Other Medications:**  Currently there are no known significant drug interactions with Ketotifen ophthalmic solution.
*   **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Patients should be advised to avoid activities requiring alertness until they know how the medication affects them.
