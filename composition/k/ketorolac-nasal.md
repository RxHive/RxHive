# Ketorolac (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Ketorolac (Nasal)

### Usage
Ketorolac nasal spray is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for the short-term (up to 5 days) management of moderate to moderately severe pain in adults.  This pain should be of a severity requiring analgesia typically managed with opioids.  While not officially approved for this use, it's sometimes used off-label for the acute abortive treatment of migraine headaches.  It's crucial to remember that Ketorolac nasal spray is *not* suitable for minor or chronic pain.

### Dosage

**Adults (<65 years, â‰¥50 kg):** For moderate to moderately severe pain, the typical dose is one spray (15.75 mg) in each nostril (total 31.5 mg) every 6-8 hours. The maximum daily dose is 126 mg (4 doses).

**Adults (<50 kg):** For moderate to moderately severe pain, the dose is reduced to one spray (15.75 mg) in only one nostril (total 15.75 mg) every 6-8 hours.  The maximum daily dose is 63 mg (4 doses).

**Adults with Renal Insufficiency:**  One intranasal spray (15.75 mg) in one nostril (15.75 mg total) every 6-8 hours; maximum dose is 63 mg/day.  Ketorolac is contraindicated in patients with advanced renal impairment or those at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion.

**Acute Migraine (off-label):** A single dose of one spray (15.75 mg) in each nostril (total 31.5 mg) may be used.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Ketorolac nasal spray in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been established.

**Important Note:** The maximum combined duration of treatment with Ketorolac nasal spray and other Ketorolac formulations should not exceed 5 days.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  Before the first use, prime the nasal spray by pressing the pump five times.  Prime again daily before the first use of a new bottle. Discard the bottle after 24 hours, even if there's medication remaining.

### How it Works

Ketorolac is a non-selective NSAID that works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, Ketorolac helps to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation.  Additional mechanisms of action, such as inhibition of chemotaxis (movement of cells toward a stimulus) and alterations in immune cell activity, also likely contribute to its effects.


### Precautions

**Contraindications:** Ketorolac nasal spray is contraindicated in patients with:

* Allergy to Ketorolac or any component of the formulation.
* Active peptic ulcer disease.
* Recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
* Advanced renal disease or risk of renal failure due to volume depletion.
* History of asthma, urticaria (hives), or allergic-type reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* Before major surgery (prophylactic use).
* During coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
* Suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis (bleeding disorder), incomplete hemostasis (incomplete blood clotting), or conditions where hemostasis is critical.
* Concomitant use with probenecid or pentoxifylline.
* During labor and delivery.


**Warnings:** Increased risks associated with Ketorolac use include:

* Bleeding
* Anaphylactoid reactions (especially in patients with aspirin triad)
* Cardiovascular thrombotic events (heart attack and stroke)
* Central nervous system effects (drowsiness, dizziness, etc.)
* Gastrointestinal events (inflammation, ulceration, bleeding, perforation)
* Hematologic effects (decreased platelet function, anemia)
* Acute renal failure
* Skin reactions (exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
* Severe hepatic reactions (hepatitis, necrosis, failure)

**Use with caution in patients with:** hypertension, edema (swelling), hepatic impairment, a history of liver disease, or those performing tasks requiring alertness.  Extra caution should be exercised in patients with a history of gastrointestinal ulcers, those taking medications that increase bleeding risk, and elderly or debilitated patients.

**Drug Interactions:** Ketorolac can interact with many other medications.  Discuss all medications you are taking with your doctor or pharmacist before using Ketorolac nasal spray.

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Ketorolac can cause fetal harm after 30 weeks of gestation. It's also excreted in breast milk. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before using it during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
