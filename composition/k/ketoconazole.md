# Ketoconazole

**Generic Name:** Ketoconazole

**Usage:**

Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat a variety of fungal infections, including:

* **Systemic fungal infections:**  These are infections that spread throughout the body, often affecting the lungs, blood, or other organs.  Examples include histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis (especially invasive forms), and cryptococcosis.  Ketoconazole is often a second-line treatment for these severe infections, meaning it's used if other antifungals are ineffective or poorly tolerated.

* **Skin infections:**  Ketoconazole is also effective against fungal skin infections like ringworm (tinea corporis), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), and yeast infections (candidiasis) of the skin and mucous membranes (e.g., oral thrush).  Topical formulations (creams, shampoos) are commonly used for these.

* **Other uses:** Ketoconazole has also been used in the past for certain hormonal conditions, such as Cushing's syndrome, but its use in this context has significantly decreased due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives.

**Important Note:**  The use of ketoconazole for systemic fungal infections is declining due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's instructions carefully.


**Side Effects:**

Ketoconazole can cause a range of side effects, some mild and others severe.  These can include:

* **Common side effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, rash.
* **Less common but potentially serious side effects:** Liver damage (hepatotoxicity â€“ this is a significant risk, requiring regular liver function tests),  adrenal insufficiency (insufficient cortisol production), gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males), decreased libido, menstrual irregularities,  hair loss.  Rarely, severe allergic reactions can occur.

**How it Works:**

Ketoconazole is an azole antifungal medication. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol production, ketoconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and ultimately inhibiting fungal growth.


**FAQs:**

* **Is ketoconazole available over-the-counter?**  Topical formulations (creams, shampoos) for skin infections are often available over-the-counter, but oral ketoconazole requires a prescription.

* **How is ketoconazole administered?**  It can be administered orally (as tablets or liquid) or topically (as creams, lotions, shampoos, or ointments).

* **What are the drug interactions?**  Ketoconazole interacts with many medications, including those metabolized by the liver.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  This interaction can lead to increased levels of other drugs in your blood, potentially causing adverse effects.

* **Is ketoconazole safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?** Ketoconazole should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother and child.  A doctor should carefully evaluate the situation.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any severe side effects, such as persistent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), or allergic reactions.
