# Ketoconazole
### Generic Name
Ketoconazole

### Usage
Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat a variety of fungal infections.  Its primary use is in treating infections caused by fungi that affect the skin, hair, and nails (such as ringworm, athlete's foot, jock itch, and various types of fungal skin infections).  It's also effective against certain types of yeast infections like candidiasis (thrush), which can affect the mouth, throat, vagina, and other areas.  While less common now due to the availability of other treatments, ketoconazole has historically been used to treat systemic fungal infections (infections that spread throughout the body), but this use is generally reserved for cases where other antifungals are ineffective or poorly tolerated.  The specific fungal infections treated and the formulation used (oral, topical) will depend on the location and severity of the infection.


### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the type of infection, the severity, the patient's age and weight, and the formulation of ketoconazole (oral tablets, topical creams, shampoos, etc.).  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.  

**Oral Dosage (Adults):**  Dosage for systemic fungal infections will be determined by a physician based on individual needs.  It's often a single daily dose.

**Oral Dosage (Children):** Oral ketoconazole is generally not recommended for children unless other treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, and only under strict medical supervision. Dosing will be carefully calculated based on weight and the specific condition being treated.

**Topical Dosage:** Topical formulations (creams, shampoos, lotions) are applied directly to the affected skin area as directed on the product label or by a doctor. The frequency and duration of application vary depending on the infection.

**IV Dosage:** Intravenous (IV) administration is used only in severe systemic fungal infections and is strictly administered under the close supervision of a healthcare professional. Dosages are individualized and depend on the severity of the infection.  It is not something to be self-administered.

### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Itching or rash at the application site (for topical formulations)


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) - this is a rare but potentially severe side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* Low blood counts (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin rashes to severe anaphylaxis)


If any concerning side effects develop, contact a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Ketoconazole works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes.  By disrupting ergosterol production, ketoconazole weakens the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and ultimately suppressing the fungal infection.  It selectively targets fungal cells without significantly harming human cells, although some side effects can occur.


### Precautions
* **Liver Disease:** Ketoconazole can cause liver damage; it should be used with extreme caution (or avoided entirely) in patients with pre-existing liver disease.  Regular liver function tests are often recommended during treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Ketoconazole interacts with many other medications, including some commonly prescribed drugs for heart conditions, blood thinners, and certain antidepressants. Always inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Ketoconazole should only be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Discuss this thoroughly with your doctor.
* **Other Precautions:**  Individuals with kidney problems should also use ketoconazole cautiously.  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking ketoconazole, as it can increase the risk of liver damage.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for ketoconazole to work?**  A: This depends on the type and severity of the infection, as well as the formulation used.  Improvements may be seen within a few days for topical treatments, but systemic infections may take longer.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ketoconazole once I feel better?** A: No, it's crucial to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if symptoms improve.  Stopping early can lead to recurrence of the infection or the development of resistant fungi.

* **Q: How should I store ketoconazole?** A: Store ketoconazole as directed on the product label.  Generally, this involves keeping it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.  Contact your doctor if you have concerns.

* **Q: Is ketoconazole available over-the-counter?** A: Topical formulations of ketoconazole are often available over-the-counter for treating mild fungal skin infections. However, oral ketoconazole requires a prescription.
