# Ketorolac (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Ketorolac (Systemic)

### Usage

Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for the short-term management (typically up to 5 days) of moderately severe acute pain.  Its analgesic effects are comparable to opioids, making it particularly useful in post-operative pain management.  While its primary use is in managing post-surgical pain, it's sometimes used to treat other types of acute, moderate-to-severe pain, though this is often off-label.  It's crucial to remember that Ketorolac is *not* intended for chronic pain or minor pain conditions.


### Dosage

Ketorolac is available in oral, intravenous (IV), and intramuscular (IM) formulations. Dosage varies significantly depending on the route of administration, patient weight, and renal function.  Always follow your doctor's specific instructions.  The information below is for general understanding only and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Pain Management (Acute, Moderately Severe):**
    * **IM:** 60 mg as a single dose, or 30 mg every 6 hours.  Maximum daily dose: 120 mg. For patients weighing less than 50 kg, the maximum daily dose is reduced to 60 mg.
    * **IV:** 30 mg as a single dose, or 30 mg every 6 hours. Maximum daily dose: 120 mg. For patients weighing less than 50 kg, the maximum daily dose is reduced to 60 mg.
    * **Oral:** 20 mg initially, followed by 10 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.  Maximum daily dose: 40 mg. Oral administration is generally only used as a continuation of IM or IV therapy and should never be the initial dose.

* **Critically Ill Patients (Off-label):**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors and should be determined by a physician experienced in managing critically ill patients.  Generally, IV or IM administration is used with careful monitoring of renal function.


* **Perioperative Patients (Off-label):** In this setting, an initial bolus dose of IV Ketorolac may be followed by a continuous infusion. Specific protocols vary considerably and should be determined by an anesthesiologist or surgeon.

**Pediatric Patients:** The safety and effectiveness of Ketorolac in children under 17 years old haven't been established. Use in pediatric patients is generally off-label and should only be considered under strict medical supervision. Dosage calculations in this population usually involve mg/kg.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Significant adjustments are necessary in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.  In patients with reduced renal function, lower doses and less frequent administration are required, and Ketorolac may be contraindicated altogether in severe cases.  In those with liver problems, Ketorolac should be used cautiously, and may be contraindicated in severe cases.  Always consult a doctor before using Ketorolac if you have any kidney or liver problems.

### How it Works

Ketorolac works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which play a crucial role in inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking the production of prostaglandins, Ketorolac reduces inflammation and relieves pain.  While the primary mechanism is COX inhibition, other potential mechanisms of action are being explored.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ketorolac is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs, active peptic ulcer disease, significant bleeding problems, severe kidney or liver impairment, during labor and delivery, and in the third trimester of pregnancy.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ketorolac can interact with many other drugs, including other NSAIDs, aspirin, blood thinners, lithium, and certain diuretics. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Warnings:**  Ketorolac can increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke), gastrointestinal problems (ulcers, bleeding), and kidney problems.  Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease, or a history of gastrointestinal problems are at increased risk.  Elderly patients are also at higher risk for these side effects.  Avoid alcohol while taking Ketorolac.


### FAQs

* **How long can I take Ketorolac?**  Ketorolac is intended for short-term use only (typically up to 5 days for adults).  Prolonged use increases the risk of serious side effects.

* **Can I take Ketorolac with other pain relievers?** Consult your doctor before combining Ketorolac with other pain medications, including over-the-counter drugs.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Don't take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you're unsure what to do.

* **How should I store Ketorolac?** Store Ketorolac according to the instructions on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Is Ketorolac safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Ketorolac is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding.  Use during other stages of pregnancy should only be considered after careful assessment of risks and benefits by a physician.
