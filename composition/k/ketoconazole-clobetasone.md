# Ketoconazole + Clobetasone

**Generic Name:** Ketoconazole + Clobetasone

**Usage:** This combination medication is a topical antifungal and corticosteroid used to treat skin infections caused by fungi (like *Candida*, *Malassezia*, and *Trichophyton*) that are accompanied by inflammation.  Common conditions treated include seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff), tinea cruris (jock itch), tinea corporis (ringworm), and tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor).  It's crucial to note that this is a prescription medication and should only be used as directed by a doctor.  Self-treating fungal infections can be harmful.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the length of treatment. Common side effects include:

* **At the application site:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, dryness, irritation, peeling, thinning of the skin, stretch marks (striae), acneiform eruptions, increased hair growth (hypertrichosis).
* **Systemic side effects (less common but more serious, especially with prolonged use or large areas of application):**  These are less likely with topical application but can occur, particularly in infants and children.  They can include adrenal suppression (especially in infants and children), Cushing's syndrome (rare), increased blood sugar levels, cataracts, glaucoma.


**How it Works:**

* **Ketoconazole:** This is the antifungal component.  It works by interfering with the fungal cell membrane synthesis, leading to fungal cell death.
* **Clobetasone:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune system's response in the affected area.  The combination of antifungal and anti-inflammatory action makes it effective in treating fungal infections with significant inflammation.
