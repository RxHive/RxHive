# Ketorolac (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Ketorolac (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Ketorolac ophthalmic solution is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat several eye conditions.  Its primary uses include:

* **Postoperative inflammation after cataract extraction:** Ketorolac helps reduce swelling and inflammation in the eye following cataract surgery.
* **Reduction of ocular pain, burning, and stinging after corneal refractive surgery:** It alleviates discomfort experienced after procedures like LASIK or PRK.
* **Treatment of pain and inflammation after cataract surgery:**  It manages both pain and inflammation as part of post-surgical care.
* **Temporary relief of ocular itching due to seasonal allergic conjunctivitis:** Ketorolac can provide temporary relief from the itchiness associated with seasonal allergies affecting the eyes.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** The following dosage information is for guidance only and should not replace the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist. Always follow your healthcare professional's recommendations.

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated and the concentration of the solution (0.4%, 0.45%, or 0.5% are common).  Generally, the recommended dosage is:

* **Adults:**  One drop in the affected eye(s) as directed by your doctor. This can range from twice daily (BID) to four times daily (QID), and the duration of treatment also varies (from a few days to two weeks). Specific dosing instructions will be detailed in your prescription.

* **Children:** Use in children is generally limited to those aged 2 years or older and only as directed by a healthcare provider. Dosage is usually similar to adult regimens but adjusted based on the child's age and condition.


**Administration:**

* Gently pull down the lower eyelid to create a pocket.
* Instill the prescribed number of drops into the pocket.
* Close your eyes gently for a few minutes.
* Avoid touching the tip of the dropper to your eye or any other surface to prevent contamination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of users) may include:

* Burning sensation in the eye

Less common, but still possible side effects include:

* Headache
* Blurred vision
* Eye pain, redness (conjunctival hyperemia), irritation, itching
* Increased eye pressure
* Allergic reactions (such as rash, swelling)


Serious, though less frequent, side effects reported include corneal issues (such as edema, ulceration, perforation, thinning), and exacerbation of asthma.  **Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.**

### How it Works

Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are chemicals in the body that contribute to inflammation, pain, and swelling. By reducing prostaglandin production, Ketorolac helps to alleviate these symptoms in the eye.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Ketorolac should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to ketorolac, aspirin, or other NSAIDs.
* **Pregnant/Breastfeeding Women:** Use during pregnancy, particularly late in pregnancy, should be avoided.  Ketorolac may pass into breast milk, so caution is advised while breastfeeding.  Consult with your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
* **Interactions with other medications:**  Inform your doctor of all medications you are currently taking, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as well as herbal supplements, to avoid potential interactions.  It's particularly important to mention other eye drops or medications that affect blood clotting.
* **Contact lenses:** Remove contact lenses before applying Ketorolac and wait at least 10 minutes before reinserting them.
* **Corneal issues:**  Individuals with pre-existing corneal diseases or those who have undergone multiple eye surgeries should use Ketorolac ophthalmic with caution under close medical supervision, as there is an increased risk of corneal complications.
* **Infections:** To minimize the risk of infection, avoid touching the dropper tip to the eye or any surface.  Use a separate bottle of eye drops for each eye if both eyes are treated.
* **Children:** Use in children is limited and requires careful monitoring by a healthcare professional.
