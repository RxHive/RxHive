# Ketorolac + Dexamethasone

**Generic Name:** Ketorolac tromethamine and dexamethasone

**Usage:**  This combination medication is typically used to reduce pain and inflammation, particularly following surgery or trauma.  It's often administered via injection (intramuscular or intravenous) for short-term management of moderate to severe pain.  The specific indication and dosage will be determined by a doctor based on the individual's condition and needs.  It is *not* intended for long-term use.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the dosage.  Common side effects can include:

* **Ketorolac-related:**  Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, increased risk of bleeding (especially with existing bleeding disorders), kidney problems (especially with prolonged use or pre-existing kidney disease), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).
* **Dexamethasone-related:** Increased blood sugar levels, mood changes, increased appetite, weight gain, insomnia, fluid retention, increased risk of infection, thinning of the skin.

More serious, though less common, side effects include:

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Stomach ulcers or bleeding
* Perforated intestines
* Liver problems
* Heart problems
* Seizures
* Psychiatric disturbances


**How it Works:**

* **Ketorolac:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.
* **Dexamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid) that works by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system.  It has a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than Ketorolac.  The combination provides a synergistic effect, meaning the combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects.

The combination of Ketorolac and Dexamethasone provides faster and more potent pain relief and inflammation reduction than either drug alone, particularly in acute settings.
