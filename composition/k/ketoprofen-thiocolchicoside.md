**How it Works:** This combination drug works through two different mechanisms:

* **Ketoprofen:** This is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.

* **Thiocolchicoside:** This is a muscle relaxant. It works by reducing muscle spasms and stiffness, thereby alleviating pain associated with muscle tension.  The exact mechanism isn't fully understood but it's thought to involve interaction with the central nervous system.
