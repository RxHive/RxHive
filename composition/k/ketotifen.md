# Ketotifen

**Generic Name:** Ketotifen

**Usage:**

Ketotifen is primarily used to treat:

* **Allergic conjunctivitis:**  It helps relieve the itching, redness, and swelling associated with allergic reactions in the eyes, such as hay fever.
* **Allergic rhinitis (hay fever):**  It can reduce symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy nose.
* **Asthma (in children):**  While less common now, it can be used as an add-on therapy in children with asthma to help prevent asthma attacks.  It is generally not a first-line treatment for asthma.

**Note:**  The specific formulation (eye drops or oral tablets/syrup) determines the exact usage.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Drowsiness:** This is a frequent side effect, especially when starting treatment. It usually lessens over time.
* **Dry mouth:**  This is another common side effect.
* **Increased appetite:** Some people experience an increase in appetite.
* **Weight gain:**  Weight gain is possible.
* **Headache:** Some individuals experience headaches.
* **Nausea:**  Nausea is a less frequent side effect.


Less common, but more serious side effects may include:

* **Liver problems:**  Rare but serious; seek medical attention if you experience jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes) or unusual fatigue.
* **Changes in behavior (particularly in children):**  This can manifest as hyperactivity or unusual irritability.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Symptoms like rash, hives, or difficulty breathing.


**How it Works:**

Ketotifen is a mast cell stabilizer.  Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals when triggered by allergens.  Ketotifen works by preventing the release of these chemicals, thereby reducing the inflammatory response and the associated allergic symptoms.  It also has some antihistamine properties.
