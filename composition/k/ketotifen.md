# Ketotifen
### Generic Name
Ketotifen

### Usage
Ketotifen is primarily used to prevent and treat allergic conditions.  Its main application is in the management of allergic conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva, the membrane lining the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye), and allergic rhinitis (hay fever, characterized by sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes).  It's also sometimes used to prevent asthma attacks in certain individuals, particularly children, although it's not a first-line treatment for asthma.  It works by stabilizing mast cells, preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators that trigger allergic symptoms.  The use of ketotifen for conditions beyond allergic conjunctivitis and rhinitis should always be under the direction of a physician.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated, the patient's age and weight, and the form of the medication. Always follow the prescription provided by your doctor or pharmacist.

**Allergic Conjunctivitis & Allergic Rhinitis:**

* **Adults and Children (oral):**  The typical dosage is usually 1 mg twice daily.  However, this can vary based on individual needs.
* **Children (oral syrup):**  Dosage is determined by weight and age and is best determined by a healthcare professional.  There are different formulations specifically designed for children.
* **Opthalmic (eye drops):**  The dosage will be specified on the product label and usually involves one or two drops in the affected eye(s) several times a day.

**Asthma Prevention:**

* **Children (oral):**  Dosage is carefully determined by a physician based on the child's age and weight and may be lower than that for allergic conjunctivitis or rhinitis.
* **Adults (oral):**  Ketotifen is generally not a first-line treatment for asthma in adults.  If prescribed, the dosage will be carefully determined by a physician.  

**Important Note:**  IV administration of ketotifen is not a standard practice.  The medication is typically administered orally or topically (as eye drops).


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Mild nausea
* Weight gain
* Headache

Less common but more serious side effects may include:

* Increased appetite
* Tremors
* Liver function abnormalities (rare)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works

Ketotifen is a mast cell stabilizer.  Mast cells are immune cells that release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals when triggered by allergens.  These chemicals cause the symptoms of allergic reactions, such as itching, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Ketotifen works by preventing the release of these inflammatory mediators from mast cells, thereby reducing the allergic response.  This effect is both preventative (stopping reactions from starting) and, to a lesser degree, therapeutic (alleviating ongoing symptoms).

### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using ketotifen if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.  The risks and benefits should be carefully weighed.
* **Liver Disease:** Ketotifen should be used with caution in individuals with liver disease as it is metabolized by the liver.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ketotifen can interact with certain medications, including central nervous system depressants (e.g., sedatives, alcohol). Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Driving and Operating Machinery:**  Ketotifen can cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
* **Older Adults:**  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of ketotifen, particularly drowsiness.  A lower dose may be necessary.
* **Children:**  Dosage must be adjusted carefully for children, as directed by a healthcare professional.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for ketotifen to work?**  A: The onset of action varies depending on the condition and formulation. For allergic rhinitis, effects might be noticed within a few days of regular use; for asthma prevention, it may take several weeks.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ketotifen suddenly?** A:  It's generally recommended to gradually reduce the dosage under the guidance of a doctor before stopping ketotifen completely, especially if it's been used for a prolonged period.

* **Q: How should I store ketotifen?** A: Store ketotifen as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is ketotifen addictive?** A: No, ketotifen is not considered an addictive medication.

* **Q: Can I take ketotifen with other allergy medications?** A:  Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking before combining ketotifen with other allergy medications.
