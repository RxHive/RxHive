# Ketorolac + Olopatadine

There is no currently approved or marketed combination drug containing both ketorolac and olopatadine.  These are two distinct drugs used for different purposes.  Therefore, a description of a "generic Ketorolac + Olopatadine" is impossible.  Ketorolac and Olopatadine would need to be discussed individually.


**Ketorolac (Generic Name):**

* **Usage:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain. Often used for post-surgical or post-traumatic pain. Available as tablets, injections, and ophthalmic solutions.  *Important Note:*  Ophthalmic ketorolac is different in use, formulation and side effects than oral or injectable ketorolac.
* **Side Effects:**  Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, heartburn, ulcers), increased risk of bleeding, kidney problems, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  headache, dizziness.  More serious side effects are possible, especially with prolonged use.
* **How it Works:**  Reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain and inflammation.
* **FAQs:**  Is it addictive? No. Can I take it long term? Generally no, due to the risk of side effects.  Should I take it with food?  Usually recommended to reduce stomach upset.  Is it safe for everyone? No, it is not recommended for people with certain conditions (e.g., kidney or liver disease, bleeding disorders, allergies to NSAIDs).

**Olopatadine (Generic Name):**

* **Usage:** Antihistamine used to treat allergic conjunctivitis (eye inflammation due to allergies) and rhinitis (runny nose and congestion due to allergies). Available as eye drops and nasal spray.
* **Side Effects:** Eye irritation (burning, stinging, dryness), headache, bitter taste (with nasal spray).  More serious side effects are rare.
* **How it Works:** Blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions.  This reduces inflammation and itching in the eyes and nasal passages.
* **FAQs:** Is it safe for daily use? Yes, as directed by a doctor or pharmacist. Can I use it while pregnant or breastfeeding?  Consult your doctor. Can it cause drowsiness? Generally it does not cause drowsiness like some other antihistamines, especially when used as eye drops.

To reiterate:  These medications are not used together and shouldn't be combined without specific direction from a physician.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medication.
