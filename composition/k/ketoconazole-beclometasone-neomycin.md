# Ketoconazole + Beclometasone + Neomycin
### Generic Name
Ketoconazole + Beclometasone + Neomycin

**Note:**  This combination is typically found in topical formulations (creams, ointments, lotions) for dermatological use, not as an oral or injectable medication.  The information below pertains to topical application.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for complete details.


### Usage

This combination medication is primarily used to treat skin conditions characterized by inflammation, fungal infection, and bacterial infection.  The three active ingredients work synergistically:

* **Ketoconazole:** A broad-spectrum antifungal agent that combats various fungal infections, such as ringworm, athlete's foot, and yeast infections of the skin.
* **Beclometasone:** A corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching associated with skin conditions. It helps to calm the irritated skin and alleviate symptoms.
* **Neomycin:** An antibiotic that targets specific bacteria, further reducing the risk of secondary bacterial infection often accompanying skin conditions.

This triple combination is frequently prescribed for skin conditions like seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff), eczema with secondary infection, and other inflammatory dermatoses with a suspected fungal or bacterial component.


### Dosage

Dosage is determined by the specific formulation (cream, ointment, lotion) and the affected area.  Generally, a thin layer of the cream/ointment/lotion is applied to the affected skin area twice daily, or as directed by a physician.  **Do not exceed the recommended dosage.**

* **Adults:**  Application as directed by a healthcare professional, usually twice daily.
* **Children:** Use only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.  Dosage and suitability will depend on the child's age, weight, and the extent of the condition.

**Oral or IV administration is not applicable for this topical combination.**


### Side Effects

Common side effects are usually mild and may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* Skin irritation or dryness.
* Itching.
* Redness.

Less common but more serious side effects, though rare with topical application, can include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling).
* Skin thinning (with prolonged use).
* Skin discoloration.
* Striae (stretch marks).
* Increased susceptibility to infections.

**If you experience any side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult your doctor immediately.**


### How it Works

This medication works through the combined actions of its three components:

* **Ketoconazole:** Disrupts the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death and thus treating fungal infections.
* **Beclometasone:**  Binds to intracellular receptors, leading to decreased inflammation and reduced itching and redness.
* **Neomycin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial growth and controlling secondary infections.

The combined effects provide a comprehensive approach to treating complex skin conditions with multiple components.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** This medication is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components (ketoconazole, beclometasone, or neomycin).
* **Drug Interactions:**  While topical application minimizes systemic interactions, inform your doctor about all medications you are currently using, including other topical treatments.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Consult your doctor before using.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.
* **Avoid contact with eyes.**  If accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.
* **Prolonged use:**  Extended use may lead to skin thinning and increased risk of infections.  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.
* **Open wounds:**  Avoid applying to open wounds or severely damaged skin.
