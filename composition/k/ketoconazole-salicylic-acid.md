# Ketoconazole + Salicylic Acid

**Generic Name:** Ketoconazole + Salicylic Acid

**Usage:** This combination is primarily used topically (applied to the skin) to treat fungal infections of the skin that are complicated by inflammation or scaling, such as:

* **Seborrheic dermatitis:** A common skin condition causing scaly, itchy patches, often on the scalp, face, and chest.
* **Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor):** A fungal infection causing discoloration of the skin.
* **Tinea corporis (ringworm):** A fungal infection causing ring-shaped patches on the body.
* **Other fungal skin infections:**  In cases where both antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects are needed.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects are generally mild and localized to the application site.  These can include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation:**  Especially upon initial application.
* **Redness:**  Inflammation at the application site.
* **Dryness or peeling:**  Of the skin.
* **Itching:** Although intended to treat itching, some individuals may experience increased itching.
* **Allergic contact dermatitis:**  In rare cases, an allergic reaction to one or both ingredients may occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Ketoconazole:** This is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting the growth of fungi. It targets the fungal cell membrane, disrupting its function and ultimately leading to fungal cell death.

* **Salicylic Acid:** This is a keratolytic agent, meaning it helps to remove dead skin cells. It softens and loosens the scales and plaques associated with fungal skin infections and inflammation, allowing better penetration of the ketoconazole and improving the overall effectiveness of the treatment.  It also possesses mild anti-inflammatory properties.

The combination provides both antifungal action (ketoconazole) and improved penetration and anti-inflammatory effects (salicylic acid), making it a more effective treatment for fungal infections accompanied by inflammation and scaling than using ketoconazole alone.
