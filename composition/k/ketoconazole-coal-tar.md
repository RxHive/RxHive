# Ketoconazole + Coal Tar
### Generic Name
Ketoconazole + Coal Tar

**Note:**  Ketoconazole + Coal Tar is not a single generic medicine with a universally recognized name. It represents a combination of two active ingredients frequently used together in topical formulations to treat certain skin conditions.  The specific brand name and exact formulation will vary depending on the manufacturer.  Always refer to the specific product labeling for complete information.


### Usage
This combination medication is primarily used topically to treat seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis.  

* **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** This common skin condition causes scaly, itchy patches, often on the scalp, face, and chest.  Ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, targets the yeast *Malassezia globosa*, often implicated in seborrheic dermatitis. Coal tar possesses anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties, helping to reduce inflammation and scaling.

* **Psoriasis:**  This chronic autoimmune disease leads to raised, red, scaly patches on the skin. While not a first-line treatment for psoriasis, the combination of ketoconazole and coal tar may be used in some cases to manage inflammation and scaling, particularly in individuals who haven't responded well to other treatments or have a mild to moderate form of the disease.


### Dosage
Dosage instructions will vary significantly depending on the specific product formulation (cream, lotion, shampoo, etc.) and the condition being treated.  **Always follow the instructions provided on the product label or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.**  There are no standard oral or IV formulations of this combination.  Topical application is always external use only.

* **Adults:** The typical application involves applying a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily, as directed.  The frequency and duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the condition and individual response.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision.  Dosage and appropriateness will be determined by the healthcare provider based on the child's age, weight, and the specific condition.

**Important:** Avoid contact with eyes, and if accidental contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.  Do not use on broken or infected skin.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Skin irritation (redness, burning, itching)
* Dryness or peeling of the skin
* Hair discoloration (especially with coal tar containing products)
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)


Less common, but potentially more serious, side effects may include:

*  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) - characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, dizziness
*  Skin discoloration (especially with prolonged use)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, stop using the medication and contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
This combination treatment utilizes the properties of both ketoconazole and coal tar to target different aspects of seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis:

* **Ketoconazole:** This antifungal medication works by inhibiting the growth of *Malassezia globosa*, a fungus commonly associated with these skin conditions.  By reducing the fungal load, it helps to lessen inflammation and scaling.

* **Coal Tar:**  Coal tarâ€™s mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to have anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and keratolytic (skin-softening) properties.  It helps to reduce inflammation, slow down the rapid skin cell turnover associated with psoriasis, and soften scales.


### Precautions
* **Allergic Reactions:** Do not use this medication if you have a known allergy to ketoconazole, coal tar, or any other ingredients in the formulation.
* **Other Medications:**  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and herbal remedies, as interactions may occur.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding, as its safety in these situations has not been fully established.
* **Sun Sensitivity:** Coal tar can increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight.  Use sunscreen and protective clothing when exposed to the sun, especially during the treatment.
* **Liver Function:** Individuals with liver problems should use this medication with caution, and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Ketoconazole can affect liver function.
