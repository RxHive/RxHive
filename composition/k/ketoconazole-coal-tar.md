# Ketoconazole + Coal Tar

Generic Name: Ketoconazole + Coal Tar (combination product - no single generic name exists)

Usage:  This combination is not a standard, pre-made pharmaceutical product.  Ketoconazole and coal tar are used separately and sometimes in compounded preparations by pharmacists for treating specific dermatological conditions.  The combination targets conditions where both antifungal and anti-inflammatory/keratolytic actions are needed. This might include:

* **Seborrheic dermatitis:**  A common skin condition causing scaly, itchy patches on the scalp, face, and other areas. Ketoconazole addresses the yeast (Malassezia) often involved, while coal tar helps reduce inflammation and scaling.
* **Psoriasis:**  While not a first-line treatment, this combination *might* be used in some cases to manage mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, leveraging coal tar's keratolytic and anti-inflammatory properties and Ketoconazole's potential to address secondary yeast infections.
* **Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor):**  A fungal infection causing discolored patches on the skin.  Ketoconazole directly targets the fungus, while coal tar can help improve skin texture and reduce inflammation.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects are a combination of those associated with both ketoconazole and coal tar, and the severity depends on concentration and individual sensitivity.  These can include:

* **Ketoconazole:**  Itching, burning, redness at the application site, allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling), liver damage (rare but serious, especially with prolonged high-dose oral use; topical use has lower risk), hormonal changes (rare).
* **Coal Tar:**  Skin irritation, redness, burning, staining of skin and clothing (difficult to remove), photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity), allergic reactions.

It's crucial to note that the exact side effect profile will vary based on the specific formulation and concentration of each ingredient in the compounded product.


How it Works:

* **Ketoconazole:**  It's an antifungal medication that inhibits the growth of fungi, including Malassezia species, by interfering with the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.
* **Coal Tar:**  A complex mixture of hydrocarbons derived from coal. Its mechanism isn't fully understood, but it exhibits anti-inflammatory, keratolytic (helps shed dead skin cells), and antipruritic (anti-itch) effects.  It can also suppress cell proliferation.


FAQs:

* **Is this combination readily available?** No. It's typically not found as a pre-made over-the-counter or prescription product.  A dermatologist or physician would need to prescribe a compounded version from a pharmacy specializing in compounding medications.
* **What are the risks of using a compounded medication?** Compounded medications are subject to less stringent manufacturing regulations than commercially produced drugs. There is a greater potential for variation in quality and potency.  Always use compounded medications only if prescribed by a healthcare professional.
* **Are there alternatives?** Yes.  Many other treatments exist for seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, and tinea versicolor, including other antifungal agents, corticosteroids, and other topical treatments.  A doctor will choose the most suitable option based on your specific condition and needs.
* **Can I use this during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  It's crucial to consult a doctor before using any medication, particularly compounded ones, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Both ketoconazole and coal tar have potential risks.
