# Ketoconazole (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Ketoconazole (Systemic)

### Usage
Ketoconazole (systemic) is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication primarily used to treat systemic fungal infections.  These are infections that spread throughout the body, affecting internal organs. While its primary use targets such systemic fungal infections, it's also been used off-label in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and Cushing's syndrome.  The off-label uses are based on its ability to interfere with hormone production, but it's crucial to understand that these are not standard applications and should only be considered under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**

* **Systemic Fungal Infections:** The typical starting oral dose is 200 mg once daily.  This may be increased to 400 mg once daily if the infection doesn't respond adequately. Treatment duration varies depending on the infection and its severity; some infections may require treatment for up to six months.

* **Advanced Prostate Cancer (Off-label):**  400 mg three times daily, usually in combination with oral hydrocortisone, until disease progression is observed.

* **Cushing's Syndrome (Off-label):**  The initial dose ranges from 400-600 mg daily, divided into two or three doses.  The dose can be increased gradually, up to a maximum of 1200 mg daily, depending on individual response and monitoring of hormone levels.


**Pediatric Dosage:**

* **Systemic Fungal Infections (Children ≥ 2 years and Adolescents):**  The oral dose is typically 3.3-6.6 mg/kg/day once daily, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment length varies depending on clinical and laboratory findings, but some infections require at least six months of therapy.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Ketoconazole is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease because it can cause liver damage (hepatotoxicity).  If liver enzyme levels rise significantly during treatment, the medication should be stopped immediately.

* **Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is generally recommended for patients with mild to severe renal impairment.  It's not dialyzable.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**

* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Skin rash
* Itchiness

**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**

* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) – This is a serious potential side effect and requires close monitoring.
* Adrenal insufficiency (reduced adrenal gland function) – particularly with high doses.
* QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm) – can be life-threatening.  This risk increases when taken with certain other medications.
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication that works by interfering with the production of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting ergosterol synthesis, ketoconazole disrupts the integrity of the fungal cell membrane, leading to fungal cell death.  In its off-label use for prostate cancer, it inhibits the production of androgens, hormones that fuel prostate cancer growth.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Ketoconazole is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ketoconazole or any of its components, and in those with acute or chronic liver disease.  It should not be used concurrently with certain other medications due to dangerous drug interactions (see interactions below).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ketoconazole interacts with a wide range of medications, significantly affecting their metabolism and blood levels.  Many drug interactions are contraindicated due to the potential for serious harm. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for information on potential interactions with any medications you are currently taking.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ketoconazole is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, meaning its safety in pregnancy hasn't been fully established.  It's generally avoided during pregnancy.  It's also excreted in breast milk, making breastfeeding during treatment inadvisable.

* **Other Precautions:**  Close monitoring of liver function is essential during treatment.  Patients with pre-existing conditions like bone fragility may also require careful monitoring.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store ketoconazole?** A: Store ketoconazole tablets in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, as directed on the product label.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking ketoconazole?** A: Alcohol can increase the risk of side effects, so it's best to avoid alcohol consumption while on this medication.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **Q: Is ketoconazole safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use should only be considered under close medical supervision due to the risk of liver damage and other side effects.

* **Q: Can I stop taking ketoconazole when I feel better?** A:  No, it's essential to complete the full course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early can lead to the recurrence of the infection.
