# Ketorolac + Tramadol
Please note:  Ketorolac and Tramadol are often prescribed *separately*, not as a fixed-combination drug.  This information addresses each drug individually, as combining them requires specific medical supervision and should only be done under a doctor's direct instructions.  Never combine medications without consulting a healthcare professional.

### Ketorolac

**Generic Name:** Ketorolac

**Usage:** Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve moderate to severe pain, typically short-term (up to 5 days). Its primary use is for post-operative pain management and pain related to other injuries or conditions.  While effective, it's not suitable for chronic pain management.


**Dosage:**

* **Oral (Tablet):**  Dosage varies depending on the severity of pain and individual response. Typically, it starts with 10 mg every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 40 mg per day.  Children should *not* take Ketorolac.  
* **Intravenous (IV):**  IV administration is usually given in a hospital setting.  The typical initial dose is 30 mg, followed by 15-30 mg every 6 hours, as directed by a physician.  Again, children should not receive IV Ketorolac.
* **Important Note:** Ketorolac should only be used for a short duration due to the risk of kidney problems and gastrointestinal side effects.


**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Kidney problems (reduced urine output, swelling), increased risk of bleeding or bruising, allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling), increased risk of heart attack or stroke (especially in those with existing heart conditions).


**How it Works:** Ketorolac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that contribute to pain and inflammation.

**Precautions:**

* **Contraindications:** Ketorolac should not be used by people with known allergies to NSAIDs, active bleeding disorders, severe liver or kidney disease, or those who have had an allergic reaction to aspirin.
* **Interactions:** Ketorolac can interact with many other medications, including blood thinners, other NSAIDs, and certain antidepressants. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision due to potential risks.
* **Elderly:** Older adults are more susceptible to side effects and should be monitored closely.


### Tramadol

**Generic Name:** Tramadol

**Usage:** Tramadol is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. It's often used for chronic pain conditions as well as acute pain.

**Dosage:**

* **Oral (Tablet, Capsule, Liquid):** Dosage varies depending on the severity of pain and individual response.  It usually starts with a low dose and is gradually increased as needed, always following your doctor's instructions.
* **Important Note:**  Children's dosing is significantly different and should be determined by a physician only.  Tramadol should never be given to a child without specific medical instructions.  IV administration of Tramadol is less common.

**Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache.
* **Less Common but Serious:**  Slowed breathing, allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling), seizures (especially in those with a history of seizures or those taking certain medications), dependence and withdrawal symptoms (with prolonged use), serotonin syndrome (a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction).


**How it Works:** Tramadol works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain. It also affects the release of norepinephrine and serotonin, neurotransmitters that influence pain signals.

**Precautions:**

* **Contraindications:** Tramadol should not be used by people with known allergies to opioids, severe respiratory depression, or those who have recently used MAO inhibitors.
* **Interactions:** Tramadol can interact with many other medications, including other opioids, sedatives, antidepressants, and alcohol.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision due to potential risks to the baby.
* **Elderly:** Older adults are more susceptible to side effects, especially respiratory depression.


**FAQs (for both Ketorolac and Tramadol):**

* **Q: Can I take these medications with alcohol?** A: No, avoid alcohol as it can increase the risk of side effects, particularly drowsiness and gastrointestinal problems, and dangerously interact with both medications.
* **Q: How should I store these medications?** A: Store both in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double the dose.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any serious side effects.
