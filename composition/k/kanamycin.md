# Kanamycin
### Generic Name
Kanamycin

### Usage

Kanamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria and some strains of Staphylococcus aureus.  It's primarily used for infections that are resistant to other antibiotics.  Specific infections treated include those of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin, and soft tissues.  It's also sometimes used in treating certain types of peritonitis (inflammation of the abdominal lining) and for irrigating body cavities during surgery to reduce bacterial contamination.  However, the increasing resistance of bacteria to kanamycin limits its current widespread use.  It's often reserved for severe infections where other antibiotics are ineffective.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the infection's severity, patient's age, weight, and kidney function.  Always follow your doctor's prescription precisely.  This information is for general knowledge and should not replace professional medical advice.

**Adults:**

* **Intravenous (IV):** 5-7.5 mg/kg of body weight per dose, every 8-12 hours. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 15 mg/kg, and the infusion should be slow (30-60 minutes).
* **Intramuscular (IM):** 5-7.5 mg/kg of body weight per dose, every 8-12 hours.  The maximum daily dose is typically 15 mg/kg, divided into equal doses.
* **Inhalation (Aerosol):** 250 mg every 6-12 hours via nebulization.
* **Intraperitoneal Instillation (for peritonitis):** 500 mg instilled into the abdominal cavity; the maximum daily dose is 1.5 g.
* **Irrigation:** A 0.25% solution is used to irrigate body cavities; the maximum daily dose is 1.5 g.

**Children:**  The dosage is generally the same as for adults, but it's crucial to calculate the dose based on the child's weight and to closely monitor for side effects due to their developing organs.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Significant adjustments are needed for individuals with kidney problems (renal impairment).  Lower doses or less frequent administration are required to prevent toxicity.  The exact adjustments depend on the individual's creatinine clearance (CrCl). Your doctor will determine the appropriate dose based on your kidney function.  Dosage adjustments for liver impairment are not usually necessary.

### Side Effects

Kanamycin, like other aminoglycosides, can cause several side effects, some serious:

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness.
* **Less Common but Serious:**
    * **Ototoxicity:** Hearing loss (high-frequency initially), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and balance problems (vertigo). This can be permanent.
    * **Nephrotoxicity:** Kidney damage, leading to impaired kidney function.
    * **Neurotoxicity:** Muscle weakness, paralysis, confusion.
    * **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Allergic reactions ranging from rash to anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction).
    * **Blood disorders:** Changes in blood cell counts (e.g., low white blood cell count, low platelet count).

If you experience any of these side effects, especially the serious ones, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Kanamycin is a bactericidal antibiotic, meaning it kills bacteria. It achieves this by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacterial ribosomes. This binding interferes with protein synthesis, a crucial process for bacterial growth and survival.  Without the ability to produce essential proteins, the bacteria die.

### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Do not use kanamycin if you have a known allergy to kanamycin or other aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin, tobramycin).
* **Kidney Disease:** Kanamycin is eliminated primarily through the kidneys.  Individuals with kidney problems are at a significantly higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity. Careful monitoring and dose adjustments are necessary.
* **Hearing Problems:**  Pre-existing hearing or balance problems increase the risk of ototoxicity.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Kanamycin is categorized as a Pregnancy Category D drug, meaning it poses a risk to the fetus.  It also passes into breast milk, potentially harming the nursing infant. Its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under strict medical supervision.
* **Neuromuscular Blockade:** Kanamycin can interfere with muscle function, increasing the risk of respiratory paralysis, especially in patients receiving anesthesia or neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Kanamycin may interact with other drugs, including diuretics and certain muscle relaxants.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Kanamycin to work?**  A: The response time varies, but improvement in symptoms may be noticeable within a few days.  However, the full course of treatment must be completed.

* **Q: Can I stop taking Kanamycin if I feel better?** A: No, it is crucial to complete the entire course of treatment as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better. Stopping early could lead to the infection returning, and it might become resistant to the antibiotic.

* **Q: How should I store Kanamycin?** A:  Store Kanamycin as directed by your pharmacist, usually at room temperature, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your doctor or pharmacist for guidance.  Do not double up on doses.

* **Q: Is Kanamycin safe for children?** A:  It can be used in children under strict medical supervision with careful dose calculation based on weight and close monitoring for side effects.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Kanamycin?** A:  It's best to avoid alcohol while on this medication as it could increase the risk of certain side effects.  Always consult your doctor.
