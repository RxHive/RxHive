# Ketorolac + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
### Generic Name
Ketorolac Tromethamine + Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC)


### Usage

This combination medication is typically used topically (applied to the skin) to relieve pain and inflammation associated with minor injuries and conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system.  The ketorolac tromethamine component is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that effectively reduces pain and inflammation.  Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) acts as a gel-forming agent, enhancing the drug's delivery and providing a soothing effect on the skin.

The primary use is for localized pain and inflammation from conditions such as:

* Minor sprains and strains
* Muscle aches and pains
* Bruises
* Minor soft tissue injuries

It's important to note that this combination is for topical use only and is not intended to treat severe pain or systemic inflammation.  It's not a substitute for oral NSAIDs or other systemic pain relievers for more significant conditions.


### Dosage

This medication is for topical use only and is applied directly to the affected area.  Dosage instructions will vary depending on the specific formulation and product strength.  Always follow the directions on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.  Generally, a small amount of gel is applied to the affected area several times a day, as needed, but not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose.

**Specific dosage instructions:**  There are no standardized adult or pediatric dosage recommendations as the concentration and application method will vary between products. Consult the product label for exact instructions.  There are no intravenous (IV) formulations of this specific combination.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of topical ketorolac tromethamine and HPMC may include:

* Skin irritation (redness, itching, burning) at the application site
* Mild rash

Less common but more serious side effects are rare with topical application but can include:

* Allergic reactions (skin rash, hives, swelling)
* Severe skin reactions (blistering, peeling)

**If you experience any significant side effects, stop using the medication and contact a healthcare professional immediately.**


### How it Works

Ketorolac tromethamine inhibits the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory chemicals responsible for pain and swelling. By reducing prostaglandin production, ketorolac effectively diminishes pain and inflammation at the site of application. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) acts as a vehicle, helping to deliver the ketorolac to the affected area and to form a gel that adheres to the skin, providing sustained release and prolonged pain relief.  This combination's topical nature limits systemic absorption, minimizing the risk of systemic side effects commonly associated with oral NSAIDs.


### Precautions

* **Allergic Reactions:**  Individuals with a known allergy to ketorolac, other NSAIDs, or HPMC should avoid this medication.
* **Skin Conditions:**  Individuals with pre-existing skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis should use caution and consult a healthcare professional before applying this medication.
* **Open Wounds:** Do not apply to open wounds or broken skin.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult a healthcare professional before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding as the safety of topical ketorolac during these periods has not been fully established.
* **Children:** Use in children should be guided by a healthcare professional.
* **Drug Interactions:** Although topical application minimizes systemic interactions, potential interactions with other medications are still possible. It is advisable to inform your doctor about all medications you are currently taking.
* **Avoid contact with eyes:** In case of accidental eye contact, rinse thoroughly with water.
