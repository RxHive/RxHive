# Ketorolac + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose

It's crucial to understand that there is no commercially available generic drug combining Ketorolac and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) in a single dosage form.  Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), while HPMC is a cellulose derivative used as a binder and excipient in many drug formulations. They are used separately.  Therefore, information on a combined "generic" is not possible.


However, we can provide information on each ingredient separately:


**Ketorolac (Generic Name):**

* **Usage:**  Ketorolac is a potent NSAID used for short-term management of moderately severe acute pain, typically post-surgical or post-traumatic pain.  It's often given by injection or as an oral tablet for a limited duration (usually no more than 5 days).

* **Side Effects:** Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, constipation, heartburn), stomach ulcers, bleeding, kidney problems, increased risk of bleeding, dizziness, drowsiness, and allergic reactions.  More serious, though rare, side effects include heart attack, stroke, and liver damage.

* **How it Works:** Ketorolac works by reducing inflammation and pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in the inflammatory response.


**Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) (Generic Name):**

* **Usage:** HPMC is not a drug itself; it's an excipient.  It's used in various pharmaceutical formulations as a binder (to help hold tablets together), a thickener, a film-forming agent (in coatings), and a lubricant.  It's often found in tablets, capsules, and topical preparations.

* **Side Effects:** HPMC is generally considered safe and well-tolerated.  Allergic reactions are rare.

* **How it Works:** HPMC doesn't have a pharmacological action; its function is purely physical and related to its properties as a polymer.


**FAQs (Regarding Ketorolac, as a combined product is not possible):**

* **Q: How long can I take Ketorolac?** A:  Ketorolac should only be taken for a short period, typically no more than 5 days, due to the risk of serious side effects.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: Can I take Ketorolac with other medications?** A:  This is crucial!  Ketorolac can interact with many other drugs, including blood thinners, other NSAIDs, and certain medications for heart conditions.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist before combining it with other medications.

* **Q: What are the signs of an allergic reaction to Ketorolac?** A:  Signs can include rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, or anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction requiring immediate medical attention).

* **Q:  Can I drink alcohol while taking Ketorolac?** A:  Alcohol can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects of Ketorolac. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking it.
