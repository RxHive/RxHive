# Ketamine
### Generic Name
Ketamine

### Usage
Ketamine's primary use is as a general anesthetic for inducing and maintaining general anesthesia before and during surgical procedures.  It's also used for procedural sedation and analgesia, meaning it helps relax and reduce pain during certain medical procedures.  Importantly, ketamine is increasingly used off-label for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, particularly neuropathic pain (nerve pain) that's resistant to other treatments, and for severe, treatment-resistant depression.  These off-label uses are gaining traction, but it's crucial to remember that they are not officially approved by regulatory agencies for these indications in all regions.  Always consult with a healthcare professional before using ketamine for any condition.

### Dosage
Ketamine dosage varies significantly depending on the intended use (anesthesia, analgesia, depression treatment), the route of administration (intravenous [IV], intramuscular [IM], intranasal, oral, subcutaneous [SubQ], rectal), and the patient's age and weight.  The provided dosage information is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used for self-medication.  Precise dosing must be determined by a qualified healthcare professional who can tailor it to individual needs and monitor the patient's response.  

**Adult Dosage (Examples; consult prescribing information for full details):**

* **General Anesthesia (IV):** Induction: 0.5-2 mg/kg; Maintenance: Supplemental doses or continuous infusion (0.1-0.5 mg/min).
* **Analgesia (IV):** Acute pain: 0.25-0.5 mg/kg bolus, followed by continuous infusion (0.05-0.25 mg/kg/h). Chronic pain: various regimens using IV, SubQ, or oral routes with careful titration.
* **Treatment-resistant depression (IV):** 0.5 mg/kg administered over 40 minutes; repeated 1-3 times weekly, possibly increasing the dose based on response and tolerance.

**Pediatric Dosage (Examples; consult prescribing information for full details):**

Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age, weight, specific procedure, and the route of administration. Always follow the prescribing information meticulously.  Intranasal, IM, IV, rectal, and oral routes may be used depending on the specific circumstance, and dosages are expressed in mg/kg.


**Important Note:** The above are simplified examples.  The actual dosage regimen is complex and highly individualized.  Always follow the guidance of a healthcare professional for accurate and safe dosage.

### Side Effects
Ketamine can cause a range of side effects, varying in frequency and severity.

**Common Side Effects:**

* Increased blood pressure and heart rate
* Nausea and vomiting
* Dizziness
* Confusion and disorientation
* Hallucinations or vivid dreams (especially during emergence from anesthesia)
* Nystagmus (involuntary eye movement)


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

* Respiratory depression
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Liver injury
* Urinary problems (e.g., cystitis)
* Psychotic symptoms (especially in individuals with pre-existing conditions)

If any adverse effects occur, it's vital to seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Ketamine primarily works by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain and spinal cord.  These receptors are involved in processing pain signals and regulating consciousness.  By blocking them, ketamine produces analgesia (pain relief) and anesthesia (loss of sensation and consciousness). At lower, subanesthetic doses, ketamine modulates pain pathways, potentially offering relief from chronic pain conditions. In the case of depression, its mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to affect neurotransmitter systems involved in mood regulation.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ketamine is contraindicated in individuals hypersensitive to it, those with certain cardiovascular conditions, infants under 3 months old, patients with a history of schizophrenia or psychosis, and those with conditions where increased blood pressure is dangerous.

* **Interactions:** Ketamine can interact with many other drugs, including other anesthetics, CNS depressants, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your healthcare professional of all medications you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  The safety of ketamine during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established.  Consult a healthcare professional to weigh the risks and benefits.

* **Specific Populations:** Children, older adults, and individuals with liver or kidney impairment may require dosage adjustments.

* **Monitoring:**  Careful monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) is crucial during and after ketamine administration.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does ketamine take to work?** A:  The onset of action depends on the route of administration and the dose.  IV administration is the fastest.


* **Q: How long does the effect of ketamine last?** A:  The duration of action varies depending on the dose and the route of administration.


* **Q: Is ketamine addictive?** A:  Ketamine has a potential for abuse and dependence, especially with prolonged or high-dose use.


* **Q: Can I drive after taking ketamine?** A:  No, it's unsafe to drive or operate machinery after receiving ketamine, especially within 24 hours of receiving general anesthesia.


* **Q: How should ketamine be stored?** A:  Store ketamine according to the instructions on the label.  Generally, it should be kept at room temperature, protected from light and moisture.
