# Kalmegh Dry Extract
### Generic Name
Kalmegh Dry Extract (Andrographis paniculata)

### Usage
Kalmegh dry extract, derived from the *Andrographis paniculata* plant, is primarily used for its **anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties**.  It's traditionally employed in various systems of medicine, particularly Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, to treat a range of conditions.  Its primary use is in managing **upper respiratory tract infections**, such as the common cold and flu, by helping to reduce symptoms like fever, cough, and sore throat.  

Beyond its use in upper respiratory infections, Kalmegh extract shows promise in supporting the body's response to **viral and bacterial infections** more generally.  Some studies suggest potential benefits in managing certain **gastrointestinal issues** and in supporting **liver health**, though more research is needed in these areas to confirm these effects definitively. It is crucial to understand that Kalmegh extract is not a replacement for established medical treatments and should be used as a complementary approach under professional guidance.


### Dosage
Dosage of Kalmegh dry extract varies considerably depending on the product formulation, the condition being treated, and the individual's health status.  There isn't a universally standardized dosage.  **It's absolutely crucial to follow the instructions provided on the specific product you are using, or as directed by a healthcare professional.**  

Generally, oral dosages of standardized extracts are found in the range of 100-300mg per day, often divided into multiple doses.  However, specific forms, such as tablets or capsules, will provide instructions for use. There are no established IV formulations of Kalmegh extract currently in common medical practice.  Dosage for children should always be determined by a pediatrician or healthcare provider, as it will be significantly lower than adult dosages and dependent on the child's age and weight.  Self-medication, especially for children, is strongly discouraged.

### Side Effects
Common side effects associated with Kalmegh dry extract are generally mild and may include:

*   Upset stomach
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching)

Less common, but more serious side effects are possible.  These might include liver damage (though rare) or interactions with other medications.  **Any significant or persistent side effects should be reported immediately to a doctor.**

### How it Works
Kalmegh's therapeutic effects are attributed to several bioactive compounds present in the plant, including andrographolides. These compounds exhibit a range of pharmacological activities. They act as **immunomodulators**, influencing the activity of the immune system to fight off infections more effectively.  They also possess **anti-inflammatory properties**, helping to reduce inflammation associated with infections and other conditions.  The exact mechanisms of action are complex and still being investigated but involve interaction with various cellular pathways involved in inflammation and immune response.
