# Ketobemidone
### Generic Name
Ketobemidone

### Usage
Ketobemidone is a potent synthetic opioid analgesic used to manage various types of severe pain. Its primary application lies in treating intense pain stemming from surgery (postoperative pain), cancer, kidney stones, and fractures.  While not explicitly stated in all sources, its use in managing myocardial infarction (heart attack) pain has also been documented.  The specific application and dosage will depend heavily on the severity of pain and the patient's individual condition, always under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.

### Dosage
Dosage of ketobemidone varies significantly depending on the route of administration, the type of pain being treated, and the individual patient's response.  There's no established pediatric dosage as safety and efficacy haven't been determined in children.  Adult dosages, as provided by various sources, are outlined below, but should not be considered a substitute for a doctor's prescription and instructions.  Always follow the specific dosage instructions given by your physician.

* **Anesthesia Induction (IM):** 5-7.5 mg combined with a spasmolytic agent (N,N-dimethyl-3,3-diphenyl 1-methylallylamine) 1 hour before induction.
* **Myocardial Infarction (IV):** 2.5 mg initially, followed by 1.25 mg every 15 minutes as needed, up to a maximum of 2.5 mg if the initial dose is insufficient.
* **Postoperative Pain (Heart Surgery - IV Infusion):** 3 mg/h initially, reducing to 0.75 mg/h after shivering subsides; administered upon arrival in intensive care and continued until the day after surgery.
* **Postoperative Pain (Abdominal Surgery - IV):** 2-3 mg over 1 minute; maximum one dose every 15 minutes.
* **Cancer Pain (Oral):** 5-15 mg every 3-6 hours with a spasmolytic agent.
* **Cancer Pain (Oral, sustained-release):** 20-60 mg twice daily.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment in standard literature.  However, ketobemidone should be used cautiously in patients with liver or kidney disease.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Confusion
* Euphoria
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth (xerostomia)
* Blurred vision
* Urinary retention
* Respiratory depression (serious)

Less common, but serious side effects, including respiratory depression, warrant immediate medical attention.  Any unexpected or concerning side effects should be reported to your doctor immediately.


### How it Works
Ketobemidone is an opioid analgesic chemically similar to meperidine. It works primarily by binding to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, reducing pain signals and producing analgesia (pain relief).  A notable characteristic is its additional NMDA-antagonist properties, partly attributed to its metabolite, nor-ketobemidone.  This dual mechanism contributes to its effectiveness in managing severe pain.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Ketobemidone is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug, secret stagnation, and acute respiratory depression.
* **Interactions:**  Concurrent use with CNS depressants (such as other opioids, sedatives, or alcohol) can significantly increase the risk of respiratory depression and cardiovascular complications.  Interactions with busulfan, desmopressin, and safinamide are also noted.
* **Warnings:** Ketobemidone should be used cautiously in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, pulmonary disease, head injuries or increased intracranial pressure, those undergoing gastrointestinal surgery, prostatic hypertrophy, urethral stricture, and the elderly or debilitated.  It should not be used concurrently with MAOIs or within 14 days of their discontinuation.  The risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome should be considered with long-term use during pregnancy.  It's not recommended during breastfeeding due to unknown excretion in breast milk.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Ketobemidone is categorized as pregnancy Category C.  Long-term use during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome.  Its use during breastfeeding is not recommended.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take Ketobemidone to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration.  Intravenous administration is generally faster than oral administration.
* **Q: How should I store Ketobemidone?** A: Store as directed by your pharmacist, typically in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking Ketobemidone?** A: No, alcohol should be avoided as it can potentiate the sedative and respiratory depressant effects of ketobemidone.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Do not double the dose; contact your doctor for advice.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Ketobemidone suddenly?** A: No, abrupt discontinuation can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
