# Ketotifen (Systemic)
### Generic Name
Ketotifen (Systemic)

### Usage
Ketotifen is primarily used as an adjunctive therapy in the long-term management of mild atopic asthma in children.  It's crucial to understand that ketotifen is *not* effective for treating acute asthma attacks; it's a preventative medication.  While primarily used for asthma, research suggests potential in other allergic conditions, though this isn't a widely established clinical application.

### Dosage
Ketotifen dosage varies depending on the child's age and weight.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's precise instructions.

**Atopic Asthma (Prophylactic Treatment):**

* **Infants and children (6 months to 3 years):**
    * Oral: Initial dose is 0.05 mg/kg once daily (OD) or divided into two doses for five days. Maintenance is typically 0.05 mg/kg twice daily (BID). The maximum daily dose is 1 mg BID.
* **Children over 3 years and adolescents:**
    * Oral: Initial dose is 1 mg OD or divided into two doses for five days. Maintenance is usually 1 mg BID.

**Important Note:**  The provided dosage information is for guidance only.  Always adhere to the prescription provided by a healthcare professional.  They will tailor the dosage based on individual needs.  Ketotifen is available in tablet and syrup form.  If using syrup, always use the provided measuring device or a calibrated one to ensure accurate dosing.

### Side Effects
Ketotifen generally has a good safety profile, but side effects can occur.

**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Dizziness
* Erythema multiforme (a type of skin reaction)
* Excitement
* Hepatitis (liver inflammation)

### How it Works
Ketotifen works in two primary ways:  It's a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks the effects of histamine (a chemical involved in allergic reactions), and it's a mast cell stabilizer, preventing these cells from releasing substances that trigger inflammation in the airways. This dual action helps reduce airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways), improving breathing in individuals with atopic asthma.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ketotifen is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to ketotifen or any formulation component.  Patients sensitive to benzoate compounds should avoid the syrup form.
* **Interactions:**  Ketotifen can interact with other medications.  It may potentiate the central nervous system (CNS) effects of sedatives, hypnotics, and other antihistamines.  Concomitant use with oral antidiabetics may lead to reduced platelet counts. Discuss all medications you are taking with your healthcare provider before starting ketotifen.
* **Warnings:** Use with caution in epileptic patients and those performing tasks requiring alertness (driving, operating machinery).  There is an increased risk of sedation and thrombocytopenia.  The safety of ketotifen during pregnancy and breastfeeding is unknown; breastfeeding is not recommended.
* **Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for hepatic or renal impairment.

### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for Ketotifen to work?** A: Therapeutic effects may not be noticeable for several weeks. Maximum effectiveness typically takes at least 10 weeks, and treatment should be continued for 2-3 months to assess its impact.
* **Q: Can I stop taking Ketotifen suddenly?** A: No.  If discontinuation is necessary, gradually reduce the dose over 2-4 weeks under a doctor's supervision.
* **Q: Can I take Ketotifen with other medications?** A: Discuss all medications you're taking with your doctor or pharmacist before starting ketotifen to avoid potential interactions.
* **Q: How should I store Ketotifen?** A: Store as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Is Ketotifen habit-forming?** A: No, ketotifen is not considered habit-forming.
