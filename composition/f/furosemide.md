# Furosemide
### Generic Name
Furosemide

### Usage
Furosemide, a potent loop diuretic, is primarily used to remove excess fluid from the body.  Its primary applications include treating edema (swelling) caused by various conditions such as congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis (ascites), and kidney disease (including nephrotic syndrome).  It's also effective in managing hypertension (high blood pressure) and acute pulmonary edema (fluid buildup in the lungs).  Beyond these primary uses, furosemide finds application in treating hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) and hypermagnesemia (high magnesium levels), usually as part of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS).  It's also sometimes used off-label in managing chronic kidney disease and hypoalbuminemia, though this should be done under close medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:** Dosage varies significantly based on the condition being treated and the patient's response.  It's crucial to follow a doctor's prescription precisely.

* **Edema:** Oral doses typically start at 20-80 mg daily, adjusted upwards as needed, with a maximum daily dose of 600 mg. Intravenous (IV) administration may start with a bolus of 20-40 mg, followed by a continuous infusion. Intramuscular (IM) administration is also possible, with similar starting doses and adjustments.
* **Hypertension:** Oral doses usually range from 20-80 mg twice daily.
* **Acute Pulmonary Edema, Hypertensive Crisis, Increased Intracranial Pressure:** IV administration is common, often starting at 40 mg and increasing as needed, with careful monitoring.
* **Hyperkalemia/Hypermagnesemia (ACLS):** IV doses typically range from 40-80 mg, administered according to ACLS protocols.
* **Chronic Kidney Disease, Hypoalbuminemia (Off-label):** IV doses often involve a 40 mg bolus, sometimes with albumin.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Furosemide dosage for children is strictly based on weight (mg/kg) and the specific condition.  It's vital to consult a pediatrician or pediatric nephrologist for accurate dosage instructions as this varies significantly based on the child's age, weight, and kidney function.  Premature infants, neonates, infants, and children have different dosage ranges.  Oral, IV, and IM routes are possible, depending on the situation.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary in cases of hepatic (liver) and renal (kidney) impairment.  Patients with reduced kidney function may require higher doses to achieve the desired effect, but careful monitoring is essential to avoid adverse effects.  The dosage in dialysis patients requires careful consideration based on residual kidney function.

### Side Effects

Common side effects include:

* Dizziness
* Headache
* Lightheadedness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Muscle cramps
* Dehydration
* Low potassium (hypokalemia)
* Low sodium (hyponatremia)
* Low magnesium (hypomagnesemia)
* Low calcium (hypocalcemia)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Hearing loss (ototoxicity)
* Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
* Liver problems
* Blood disorders


**If you experience any of these side effects, particularly the serious ones, contact your healthcare provider immediately.**

### How it Works

Furosemide works by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the loop of Henle within the kidneys. This disruption leads to increased excretion of water, sodium, potassium, and other electrolytes in the urine, thereby reducing fluid volume and blood pressure.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Furosemide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to furosemide or sulfonamides, anuria (absence of urine production), severe renal impairment, hepatic coma or precoma, and uncorrected electrolyte imbalances (hypovolemia, dehydration, hypotension). It should be used cautiously in breastfeeding mothers.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Furosemide can interact with many other drugs, including ACE inhibitors, aminoglycosides, antihypertensives, NSAIDs, and cardiac glycosides.  Always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Furosemide is a Category C drug in pregnancy, meaning its safety hasn't been fully established. It's excreted in breast milk and may affect milk production.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only occur under strict medical supervision.
* **Specific Populations:** Older adults and patients with liver or kidney disease require careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments. Children's dosages are weight-based and require pediatric expertise.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take furosemide with food?** A: Yes, taking furosemide with food or milk may reduce gastrointestinal upset.
* **Q: How should I store furosemide?** A: Store furosemide at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: Can I stop taking furosemide suddenly?** A: No, stopping furosemide suddenly can be harmful. Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Don't double up on doses.
* **Q: Can furosemide cause dizziness?** A: Yes, dizziness is a common side effect. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how the medication affects you.
* **Q: Is furosemide addictive?** A: No, furosemide is not addictive.
