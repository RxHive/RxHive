# Furosemide

**Generic Name:** Furosemide

**Usage:**

Furosemide is a loop diuretic (water pill) used to treat fluid retention (edema) caused by various medical conditions, including:

* **Congestive heart failure:** Helps reduce fluid buildup in the lungs and body.
* **Liver disease (cirrhosis):**  Reduces fluid retention associated with liver damage.
* **Kidney disease:** Helps remove excess fluid and electrolytes.
* **High blood pressure (hypertension):**  Used in combination with other medications to lower blood pressure.
* **Hypercalcemia:**  Helps lower high levels of calcium in the blood.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects can include:

* **Dehydration:**  Frequent urination can lead to dehydration; drink plenty of fluids.
* **Dizziness or lightheadedness:**  Due to low blood pressure.  Rise slowly from a sitting or lying position.
* **Muscle cramps:**  Electrolyte imbalances can cause cramps.
* **Headache:**
* **Nausea and vomiting:**
* **Diarrhea:**
* **Low blood potassium (hypokalemia):**  Can lead to muscle weakness and irregular heartbeats. Regular blood tests are needed to monitor potassium levels.
* **Low blood sodium (hyponatremia):** Can cause confusion, lethargy, and seizures.
* **Low blood magnesium (hypomagnesemia):** Can cause muscle weakness and tremors.
* **Increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia):**  Particularly concerning for people with diabetes.
* **Increased blood uric acid levels (hyperuricemia):** Can exacerbate gout.
* **Hearing loss (rare but serious):** Usually reversible if medication is stopped.


Serious side effects are rare but require immediate medical attention:

* **Allergic reactions:** Rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.
* **Severe dehydration:**  Leading to kidney failure.
* **Significant electrolyte imbalances:**  Leading to heart problems or seizures.


**How it Works:**

Furosemide works by preventing the body from reabsorbing sodium and water in the kidneys.  This increased excretion of sodium and water leads to a decrease in fluid volume and blood pressure. It acts on the loop of Henle in the kidneys, hence its name "loop diuretic".  This mechanism is different from other diuretics like thiazides.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I take furosemide with other medications?**  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.  Interactions can occur with many drugs, particularly those affecting potassium levels (e.g., ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics).
* **How often should I take furosemide?**  The dosage and frequency are determined by your doctor based on your individual needs and condition.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Can I stop taking furosemide suddenly?**  No, stopping abruptly can be dangerous, especially if you have heart failure.  Your doctor should gradually reduce your dose.
* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention if you experience serious side effects.  Milder side effects may improve as your body adjusts to the medication.
