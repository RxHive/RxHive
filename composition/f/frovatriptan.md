# Frovatriptan
### Generic Name
Frovatriptan

### Usage
Frovatriptan is a triptan medication specifically used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults, both with and without aura.  It's crucial to understand that Frovatriptan is *not* for preventing migraines (prophylactic use) or treating cluster headaches.  A proper diagnosis of migraine is essential before using this medication.

### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical starting dose is 2.5 mg taken orally with liquid. If the headache returns, a second 2.5 mg dose can be taken after two hours, but the maximum daily dose is 7.5 mg.  It's important to note that the effectiveness of a second dose is not guaranteed if the first dose doesn't provide relief.  There's also no established safety data for treating more than four migraine attacks per month on average.

**Children:** The safety and efficacy of Frovatriptan in children have not been established, and it's therefore not recommended for pediatric use.

**Dosage Adjustments:** For individuals with mild to moderate liver impairment, no dose adjustment is necessary. However, those with severe liver impairment should use Frovatriptan with caution under close medical supervision.  Kidney impairment does not typically require dose adjustments.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Nervous system: Dizziness, fatigue, headache, tingling sensations (paresthesia), drowsiness, anxiety, abnormal sensations (dysesthesia), reduced sensation (hypoesthesia), insomnia, and pain.
* Cardiovascular: Flushing, hot or cold flashes, chest pain, and palpitations.
* Respiratory: Runny nose (rhinitis) and sinusitis.
* Gastrointestinal: Dry mouth (xerostomia), nausea, indigestion (dyspepsia), abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.
* Dermatologic: Excessive sweating (diaphoresis).
* Neuromuscular and skeletal: Musculoskeletal pain.
* Ophthalmic: Visual disturbances.
* Otic: Ringing in the ears (tinnitus).


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**  A wide range of less common side effects have been reported, including allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction),  seizures, and stroke.  It's vital to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious or concerning side effects.

### How it Works
Frovatriptan is a serotonin receptor agonist, meaning it binds to and activates specific serotonin receptors (5-HT<sub>1B,1D</sub>) in the brain and blood vessels. This action causes constriction of blood vessels in the head and reduces the release of substances that trigger pain and inflammation associated with migraines.  By targeting these receptors, Frovatriptan helps alleviate the headache pain and other migraine symptoms.

### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Frovatriptan is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug or its components, peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled high blood pressure, ischemic heart disease (including angina, prior heart attack, or silent ischemia), coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal angina), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or other cardiac conduction disorders, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, ischemic bowel disease, recent use of other 5-HT1 agonists or ergot medications,  severe liver impairment, and certain types of migraine (e.g., hemiplegic or basilar migraine).

**Interactions:** Frovatriptan can interact with several other medications, including antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs), MAO inhibitors, and ergot derivatives.  The combination of Frovatriptan and other serotonin-affecting medications can potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.  Concomitant use with other triptans or ergot-containing medications should be avoided.

**Warnings:**  Frovatriptan can increase the risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), vasospasm,  and serotonin syndrome.  Caution is warranted in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease,  liver or kidney disease, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding (category C pregnancy).
