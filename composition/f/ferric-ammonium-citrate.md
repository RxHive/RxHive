# Ferric Ammonium Citrate
### Generic Name
Ferric Ammonium Citrate

### Usage
Ferric ammonium citrate is primarily used to treat iron-deficiency anemia.  This condition occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron to produce sufficient hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.  Iron deficiency can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.  While its primary use is in treating anemia, ferric ammonium citrate may also be used as a supplemental iron source in cases where dietary intake is insufficient.


### Dosage
Dosage varies based on age, the severity of the anemia, and the specific formulation (e.g., capsule, liquid).  Always follow your doctor's prescription and instructions.

**Adults (Iron-deficiency anemia):**  The usual oral dosage is one capsule or 15 mL (milliliters) twice daily (BID), taken after meals.  Higher doses may be necessary for older adults; your doctor will determine the appropriate dose.

**Children (Iron-deficiency anemia):** The typical oral dosage is 5 mL twice daily (BID), administered after meals.  Precise dosage will be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the anemia.

**Important Note:**  The information above is for general guidance only.  A healthcare professional should always determine the appropriate dosage based on individual needs.  Never adjust your dosage without consulting your doctor.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of ferric ammonium citrate can include:

* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Black stools (this is a harmless effect)
* Temporary staining of teeth (with liquid formulations)

Less common, but potentially serious, side effects are possible.  If you experience any unusual symptoms or worsening of your condition, seek immediate medical attention.

### How it Works
Ferric ammonium citrate works by providing the body with readily absorbable iron.  Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen. By replenishing iron stores, ferric ammonium citrate helps the body produce more red blood cells, thereby improving oxygen delivery throughout the body and alleviating symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Ferric ammonium citrate should not be used by individuals with hypersensitivity to the medication, hemolytic anemia (unless iron-deficiency anemia is also present), hemochromatosis (iron overload), hemosiderosis (excess iron deposits), peptic ulcers, regional enteritis (Crohn's disease), ulcerative colitis, or a history of receiving repeated blood transfusions.

* **Caution:**  Ferric ammonium citrate should be used cautiously in children, older adults, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and during prolonged use.  The safety and efficacy of long-term use have not been fully established.

* **Drug Interactions:**  Ferric ammonium citrate can interact with certain medications. Inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking to avoid potential interactions.  For example, antacids can reduce iron absorption.

* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  The safety of ferric ammonium citrate during pregnancy and lactation is not fully established. Discuss its use with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.
