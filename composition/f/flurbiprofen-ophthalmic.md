# Flurbiprofen (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Flurbiprofen (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to prevent the constriction of the pupil (miosis) during eye surgery. This helps the surgeon to have a clearer view of the eye structures during the procedure.  While its primary use is intraoperative, it's important to note that this medication is not used to treat any eye disease or condition outside of this specific surgical context.

### Dosage
**Intraoperative Miosis (Adult):**  The recommended dose is one drop of 0.03% Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution in the affected eye(s) every 30 minutes, beginning two hours before surgery. A total of four drops per eye is typically administered.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution in children have not been established.  Therefore, it's not recommended for use in pediatric patients.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance in these cases.


### Side Effects
Common side effects may include:

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eye (usually temporary)
* Eye irritation
* Miosis (pupil constriction) – though this is the intended effect during surgery, it can be excessive.
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation) – less common than miosis.
* Anterior chamber hemorrhage (bleeding in the front part of the eye).
* Ocular hyperemia (redness of the eye).


Less common, but serious, side effects include hemorrhagic diathesis (bleeding in the ocular tissues, usually associated with surgery) and ocular fibrosis (scarring).  If any side effects occur, particularly if they are severe or persistent, contact your ophthalmologist or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Flurbiprofen belongs to a class of drugs called NSAIDs. It works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, substances that play a role in inflammation and the constriction of the pupil (miosis). By reducing prostaglandin production, Flurbiprofen helps to prevent miosis during surgery.  Other mechanisms, such as effects on chemotaxis (cell movement) and lymphocyte/neutrophil activity, may also contribute to its anti-inflammatory action, although these are less fully understood.

### Precautions
* **Hypersensitivity:** Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Flurbiprofen or any component of the formulation.
* **Bleeding:** Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), as it may increase bleeding time and impair wound healing.
* **Aspirin/NSAID Sensitivity:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of sensitivity to aspirin or other NSAIDs, particularly those who have experienced bronchospasm, asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria after taking these medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Flurbiprofen ophthalmic is categorized as pregnancy Category C. This means that the potential benefits of use during pregnancy must be carefully weighed against the potential risks to the fetus. The decision to use it during pregnancy should be made by a doctor, and if used, the minimum effective dose with punctal occlusion (blocking tear drainage) should be considered. It's unknown whether Flurbiprofen is excreted in breast milk following ophthalmic administration. The decision to breastfeed or discontinue the medication requires careful consideration of the benefits to the mother.
* **Infection:** To reduce infection risk after bilateral eye surgeries, use separate bottles of eye drops for each eye.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution?**  A: Store it as directed on the product label, usually at room temperature, away from direct light and heat.

* **Q: Can I use Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution if I wear contact lenses?** A: It's best to remove contact lenses before instilling the drops and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them.  Always follow your ophthalmologist's instructions.

* **Q:  Can I use this medication for other eye problems?** A: No. Flurbiprofen ophthalmic solution is specifically indicated for the prevention of miosis during surgery and is not suitable for treating other eye conditions.  Consult your doctor for appropriate treatment of other eye problems.

* **Q: What should I do if I accidentally miss a dose?** A: If you miss a dose, administer it as soon as possible, unless it's close to the next scheduled dose. Do not double the dose.
