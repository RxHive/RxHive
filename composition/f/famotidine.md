# Famotidine

**Generic Name:** Famotidine

**Usage:**

Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used to treat several conditions related to excess stomach acid:

* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):**  Reduces stomach acid production, relieving heartburn and acid reflux symptoms.
* **Peptic Ulcers:** Helps ulcers heal by reducing acid secretion.
* **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** A rare condition characterized by excessive stomach acid production; famotidine helps control this overproduction.
* **Dyspepsia (Indigestion):** Can provide relief from indigestion symptoms associated with excess stomach acid.
* **Gastritis (Stomach Inflammation):** Helps reduce inflammation by lowering acid levels.


**Side Effects:**

Famotidine is generally well-tolerated, but side effects can occur.  These are usually mild and temporary, but you should contact your doctor if they persist or worsen:

* **Common side effects:** Headache, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness.
* **Less common side effects:**  Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, fatigue.
* **Rare but serious side effects:**  These are uncommon but require immediate medical attention. They include:  agranulocytosis (severe decrease in white blood cells), aplastic anemia (bone marrow failure), hepatic (liver) dysfunction, serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).


**How it Works:**

Famotidine works by blocking the action of histamine at H2 receptors in the stomach. Histamine stimulates the production of stomach acid. By blocking these receptors, famotidine significantly reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces, thereby alleviating symptoms associated with excess acidity.
