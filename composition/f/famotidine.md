# Famotidine
### Generic Name
Famotidine

### Usage

Famotidine is a medication primarily used to reduce stomach acid production.  Its main applications include treating and preventing ulcers (both duodenal and gastric), managing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and controlling the symptoms of heartburn, indigestion, and sour stomach.  It's also used in treating conditions with abnormally high stomach acid production, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  While not its primary use, famotidine can sometimes be used to prevent the recurrence of ulcers.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated and the route of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's prescription. Examples of common dosages include:

* **Duodenal Ulcer (Oral):** 40 mg once daily at bedtime, or 20 mg twice daily for 8 weeks. Maintenance therapy may involve a lower dose.
* **GERD (Oral):**  20-40 mg twice daily for 6-12 weeks, depending on the severity.
* **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (Oral):**  Starts at 20 mg every 6 hours, with potential increases up to 160 mg every 6 hours as needed.
* **Heartburn/Indigestion Prevention (Oral):** 10-20 mg twice daily, 15-60 minutes before meals.


**Pediatric Dosage:**  Famotidine use in children is generally determined by a physician based on weight and the specific condition. Dosages are typically calculated in mg/kg/day and are generally lower than adult doses.  Always consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function (renal impairment). Reduced doses or less frequent administration might be recommended in such cases.  Those with liver impairment may also require dosage adjustments, though specific guidance isn't always available in standard prescribing information. Always discuss any pre-existing conditions with your doctor before starting famotidine.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (affecting 1-10% of users):**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Constipation

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (occurring in less than 1% of users):**  These require immediate medical attention:

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)
* Confusion (particularly in older adults or those with kidney or liver problems)
* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)

This list isn't exhaustive. If you experience any unusual or concerning side effects, contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Famotidine is a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist.  Histamine is a substance in your body that stimulates the production of stomach acid. By blocking histamine's action on H2 receptors in the stomach lining, famotidine reduces the amount of acid produced, thereby alleviating symptoms associated with excess stomach acid and promoting ulcer healing.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Do not take famotidine if you are allergic to it or any of its ingredients.
* **Kidney Disease:**  Individuals with kidney problems may need dose adjustments due to famotidine's excretion through the kidneys.
* **Liver Disease:** While less common, some individuals with liver disease may also require dosage adjustments.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Discuss famotidine use with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant.  It is generally considered safe during pregnancy but data is limited.  Famotidine is excreted in breast milk, so its use during breastfeeding should be carefully weighed.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Famotidine may interact with other medications, particularly some antifungals. Discuss all medications (prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal) with your doctor before taking famotidine.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more sensitive to famotidine's side effects, especially confusion.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take famotidine with antacids?** A:  While not strictly contraindicated, combining famotidine with antacids might slightly reduce famotidine's absorption.  Consult your doctor.
* **Q: How should I store famotidine?** A: Store famotidine as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A: The onset of action varies depending on the formulation and condition being treated. Relief from heartburn may occur within a few minutes, but ulcer healing takes longer.
* **Q: Can I stop taking famotidine suddenly?** A:  No, do not stop taking famotidine without consulting your doctor.  Sudden cessation might lead to a rebound increase in stomach acid production.
* **Q: Is famotidine habit-forming?** A: No, famotidine is not habit-forming.
