# Fesoterodine
### Generic Name
Fesoterodine

### Usage
Fesoterodine is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  This means it helps manage the symptoms associated with OAB, which include:

*   **Urge urinary incontinence:**  The involuntary leakage of urine preceded by a strong urge to urinate.
*   **Urgency:** A sudden, compelling urge to urinate.
*   **Frequency:**  Needing to urinate more often than normal.

Fesoterodine works by relaxing the bladder muscles, reducing the frequency and urgency of urination and improving bladder control.  It does not address the underlying cause of OAB, but rather manages its symptoms.


### Dosage

**Adults:** The usual starting dose of Fesoterodine is 4 mg once daily (OD).  Depending on individual response and tolerability, the doctor may increase the dose to 8 mg OD.  

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of Fesoterodine in children have not been established, therefore it's not recommended for use in pediatric populations.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

*   **Hepatic Impairment (Liver Disease):**  For patients with mild to moderate liver impairment, no dosage adjustment is typically needed. However, Fesoterodine is not recommended for use in patients with severe liver impairment.
*   **Renal Impairment (Kidney Disease):**  In patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 mL/min or greater, no dosage adjustment is necessary. For those with a CrCl of less than 30 mL/min, the maximum dose should be limited to 4 mg once daily.  A doctor should closely monitor kidney function.

Fesoterodine is typically administered orally as a tablet.  It should be swallowed whole; do not chew, crush, or divide the tablet.

### How it Works

Fesoterodine is an anticholinergic drug. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates bladder contractions. By inhibiting these contractions, Fesoterodine helps to relax the bladder muscles, reducing the frequency and urgency of urination.  This mechanism provides relief from the symptoms of overactive bladder.


### Precautions

*   **Contraindications:** Fesoterodine is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) to Fesoterodine, tolterodine, or any component of the formulation; those with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.
*   **Increased Risk:**  Increased risk of angioedema, central nervous system (CNS) effects, and heat prostration.
*   **Use with Caution:** Exercise caution in patients with bladder flow obstruction, myasthenia gravis, narrow-angle glaucoma (under treatment), decreased gastrointestinal motility, gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, renal impairment, and when exposed to hot weather or strenuous exercise.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Concurrent use with itraconazole or potassium may increase Fesoterodine exposure or risk of gastrointestinal lesions.  Concurrent use with bupropion or donepezil (both agents that lower the seizure threshold) may further lower the seizure threshold.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fesoterodine is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  The decision to breastfeed while taking this medication should be made in consultation with a doctor, considering potential infant exposure risks versus the benefits of breastfeeding and medication.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Can I take Fesoterodine with food?** A: Fesoterodine may be taken with or without food.

*   **Q: How should I store Fesoterodine?** A: Store Fesoterodine at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

*   **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Fesoterodine?** A:  No, patients should avoid activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery. Drowsiness can be a side effect and alcohol can exacerbate this effect.

*   **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not take two doses at once.

*   **Q: Can I suddenly stop taking Fesoterodine?** A:  It is generally recommended to talk to your doctor before discontinuing Fesoterodine.  Stopping the medication abruptly may not be advisable.

*   **Q: Is Fesoterodine safe for older adults?** A:  Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of Fesoterodine.  Close monitoring and careful dose adjustment may be needed.  A doctor should carefully assess the risk-benefit profile.
