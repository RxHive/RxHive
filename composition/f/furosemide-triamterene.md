# Furosemide + Triamterene
### Generic Name
Furosemide + Triamterene


### Usage

Furosemide + Triamterene is a combination medication used to treat fluid retention (edema) and high blood pressure (hypertension).  It works by combining the actions of two different diuretics (water pills): furosemide and triamterene.  

Furosemide is a loop diuretic, meaning it works in the kidneys to increase the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. This leads to a reduction in fluid volume and blood pressure. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps the body retain potassium while also increasing the excretion of sodium and water.  The combination of these two diuretics is particularly effective because it enhances the diuretic effect while minimizing the potassium loss that can occur with loop diuretics alone.  This combination is often prescribed when a powerful diuretic effect is needed, but potassium depletion needs to be avoided.


### Dosage

Dosage of Furosemide + Triamterene varies significantly depending on the individual's condition, age, and response to treatment.  It's crucial to follow the prescription instructions provided by your doctor exactly.  There is no standardized pediatric dosage; its use in children is uncommon and needs careful consideration by a pediatrician.

**Oral Administration (Adult):** The usual starting dose is one tablet (typically containing 40mg furosemide and 50mg triamterene) once or twice daily. The doctor may adjust the dose based on your blood pressure and fluid retention.  Higher doses or more frequent administration might be necessary, but this should only be done under strict medical supervision.

**IV Administration:** This combination is not typically administered intravenously. Furosemide is available for IV administration, but it's generally used separately, not in combination with triamterene.

**Important Note:**  This information is for general knowledge only and does not replace individualized medical advice.  Always consult your doctor or pharmacist for specific dosage instructions tailored to your situation.


### Side Effects

Common side effects of Furosemide + Triamterene include:

* Dizziness
* Lightheadedness
* Headache
* Muscle cramps
* Weakness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Dehydration
* Increased thirst

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Irregular heartbeat
* Low blood pressure (hypotension)
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood) - particularly a concern with impaired kidney function.
* Hearing loss (temporary or permanent) - usually associated with high doses or impaired kidney function.
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


If you experience any serious side effects, seek immediate medical attention.  Even seemingly minor side effects warrant discussion with your doctor or pharmacist, as they may indicate a need for dosage adjustment or alternative treatment.


### How it Works

Furosemide inhibits the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter in the loop of Henle in the kidneys. This action prevents the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water, leading to increased excretion of these substances in the urine. This results in diuresis (increased urine production) and decreased blood volume and blood pressure.

Triamterene blocks the sodium channels in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys.  This reduces sodium reabsorption and, consequently, water reabsorption.  Importantly, it also reduces potassium excretion, counteracting the potassium-wasting effect of furosemide.  The combined action of these two drugs leads to a significant diuretic effect with better potassium balance than using furosemide alone.


### Precautions

* **Kidney disease:**  This medication should be used with extreme caution in individuals with impaired kidney function.  The dose may need to be significantly reduced or the medication avoided altogether.
* **Liver disease:**  Caution is also warranted in individuals with liver disease.
* **Diabetes:**  This medication can affect blood sugar levels, so close monitoring is needed for people with diabetes.
* **Heart disease:**  Use with caution in individuals with severe heart disease.
* **Electrolyte imbalances:**  Regular monitoring of electrolyte levels (potassium, sodium) is crucial.
* **Drug interactions:** This medication can interact with many other drugs, including NSAIDs, lithium, and potassium supplements. Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  The use of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only used if the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor.
* **Older adults:**  Older adults are more susceptible to the side effects of this medication, particularly dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking this medication suddenly?** A: No, stopping abruptly can lead to a sudden worsening of your condition.  Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store this medication?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?** A:  Alcohol can exacerbate the side effects of this medication, especially dizziness and dehydration. It's best to avoid alcohol.

* **Q: Can I take this medication with other diuretics?** A:  Generally not recommended without consulting your doctor, as it can lead to excessive fluid and electrolyte loss.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience severe side effects?** A: Seek immediate medical attention.
