# Fructose
### Generic Name
Fructose

### Usage
Fructose is a simple sugar, a monosaccharide, naturally occurring in many fruits and honey. While it's a readily available source of energy for the body, its medicinal use is limited and largely outdated.  Historically, fructose has been explored as an alternative to glucose in intravenous (IV) nutrition, particularly in parenteral nutrition solutions. However, this practice is no longer recommended due to the significant risk of lactic acidosis, a dangerous build-up of lactic acid in the blood.  Similarly, its use in treating severe alcohol poisoning has also been abandoned.  Currently, fructose doesn't have a widely accepted therapeutic role in medicine.  Its primary use remains as a naturally occurring sugar in foods and beverages.

### Dosage
There are no standard medicinal dosages for fructose as it's not prescribed as a medication. The amount of fructose consumed through diet varies widely depending on individual food choices.  In the past, when used intravenously (IV), the dosage was highly individualized and carefully monitored by medical professionals.  This is no longer a standard practice due to the risks associated with its use.

### Side Effects
While fructose is a naturally occurring sugar found in many foods, excessive consumption can lead to various adverse effects.  These are generally related to metabolic issues and are not specific to fructose used medicinally (since that is largely outdated).  Potential side effects from excessive fructose intake may include:


*   Increased blood triglyceride levels
*   Weight gain
*   Increased risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
*   Fatty liver disease (non-alcoholic)
*   Lactic acidosis (especially when administered intravenously, a reason why IV fructose is no longer used)
*   Gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, bloating)


It's crucial to note that the development and severity of these side effects depend heavily on the amount and frequency of fructose consumption, as well as individual factors like overall diet and metabolic health.

### How it Works
Fructose is absorbed in the small intestine via specific glucose transporters (GLUTs), primarily GLUT-2 and GLUT-5.  Once absorbed, it is primarily metabolized in the liver by the enzyme ketohexokinase (KHK), which converts fructose to fructose-1-phosphate.  This then enters various metabolic pathways, ultimately contributing to energy production (ATP).  However, its metabolic pathway differs from glucose, and this difference is, in part, responsible for the adverse effects seen with high intake.  The inability of the liver to effectively process large quantities of fructose can lead to the aforementioned metabolic issues.


### Precautions
Due to the risks associated with intravenous fructose administration, this route of administration is no longer recommended. Oral consumption of fructose should be approached cautiously, particularly by individuals with existing metabolic disorders like diabetes or fatty liver disease.  Excessive fructose intake should be avoided.  Pregnant or breastfeeding women and individuals with pre-existing health conditions should consult a healthcare professional regarding appropriate fructose intake as part of a balanced diet.  It's vital to remember fructose is a carbohydrate source, and should be managed accordingly in a balanced, healthy diet.


### FAQs

*   **Q: Is fructose safe to consume?**  A: In moderation, as part of a balanced diet, fructose is generally safe.  However, excessive consumption can have adverse health effects.

*   **Q: Can fructose be used medicinally?** A:  Not in a standard medicinal capacity.  Its use in intravenous nutrition and alcohol poisoning treatment is outdated due to safety concerns.

*   **Q: What are the best sources of fructose?** A: Fruits, honey, and some vegetables naturally contain fructose.

*   **Q: Should I avoid fructose altogether?** A:  No, a complete avoidance is unnecessary unless advised by a doctor due to specific health conditions.  Moderation is key.

*   **Q:  Can I take fructose if I have diabetes?** A:  Individuals with diabetes need to monitor their fructose intake carefully, as it can affect blood sugar levels, albeit differently from glucose. Consult your doctor or a registered dietitian for personalized guidance.
