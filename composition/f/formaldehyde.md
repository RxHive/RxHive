# Formaldehyde
### Generic Name
Formaldehyde

### Usage
Formaldehyde solution is primarily used as a topical disinfectant, effective against bacteria, fungi, and many viruses.  Its bactericidal properties make it useful in various settings, including medical procedures. A key application is in treating plantar and palmar warts, where it acts as a drying agent, helping to remove the affected tissue.  While its primary use is as a disinfectant, it's also employed for its drying effect on the skin, sometimes used pre- or post-surgical wart removal.  It's important to note that this use is specific and not a general treatment for skin conditions.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For the removal of palmar and pedal warts (as an anti-hyperhidrosis or drying agent), a 3% v/v solution or a 0.75% w/w gel is applied topically to the affected area as needed. The exact frequency and duration depend on the individual's response and the severity of the condition.  This should always be under the direction of a healthcare professional.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  The safety and efficacy of formaldehyde in children have not been established.  It should not be used in children.


### Side Effects
* Irritation
* Skin whitening and hardening
* Contact dermatitis
* Laryngospasm (rare but serious)

It's crucial to note that any unusual or persistent skin reactions require immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.


### How it Works
Formaldehyde's germicidal action stems from its ability to denature bacterial proteins, leading to bacterial cell lysis (breakdown).  In its application for wart removal, it's believed to disrupt the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes integral to keratinization, causing the affected skin layer to break down.  The hardening effect on the epidermis when applied to intact skin makes the infected layer tough and whitish, aiding in its removal.  The precise mechanism in this keratolytic effect is not fully understood.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Formaldehyde is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to formaldehyde or any component of the formulation.
* **Interactions:** Formaldehyde can decrease the antimicrobial effects of other drugs by reacting with proteins.  Concurrent use with other antimicrobials should be avoided.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Formaldehyde is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  The excretion of formaldehyde in breast milk is unknown; breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment.
* **General Precautions:** Formaldehyde is for external use only. A skin sensitivity test is recommended before application.  Patients should clean and thoroughly dry the affected area before application. Hands should be washed before and after use, except when treating hand warts, where washing after application should be avoided.  Contact with the face, eyes, nose, and mucous membranes must be avoided. In case of accidental ingestion, contact a poison control center immediately.
