# Fostemsavir
### Generic Name
Fostemsavir

### Usage
Fostemsavir is an antiretroviral medication used to treat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults.  It's specifically indicated for those who are heavily treatment-experienced and have multidrug-resistant HIV-1. This means the virus has developed resistance to several other antiretroviral drugs they've previously tried, making treatment challenging.  Fostemsavir is not a standalone treatment; it's always used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.  Its primary use is to combat HIV-1 infection in individuals who have failed prior treatment regimens due to resistance, intolerance to previous medications, or safety concerns related to previous treatments.  There are currently no secondary uses approved.

### Dosage
The standard adult dosage is 600 mg twice daily (BID) orally. This is always administered in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.  Dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment are not specified in current prescribing information.  Fostemsavir is not currently approved for use in children, so pediatric dosage information is unavailable.


### Side Effects
Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Increased serum creatinine levels (kidney function marker)

Side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include:

* **Nervous System:** Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the extremities), peripheral sensory neuropathy, and sleep disturbances.
* **Cardiovascular:** Increased serum creatine kinase levels (muscle enzyme), prolonged QT interval (heart rhythm abnormality).
* **Dermatologic:** Itching (pruritus) and skin rash.
* **Endocrine and Metabolic:** High cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), increased LDL cholesterol, increased triglycerides, and increased uric acid levels.
* **Gastrointestinal:** Abdominal pain, diarrhea, altered taste (dysgeusia), indigestion (dyspepsia), increased serum lipase levels (pancreatic enzyme), nausea, and vomiting.
* **Hematologic and Oncologic:** Decreased hemoglobin levels (anemia), decreased neutrophils (type of white blood cell), and leukocyte disorders (white blood cell abnormalities).
* **Hepatic:** Increased levels of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, bilirubin).
* **Immunologic:** Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
* **Neuromuscular and Skeletal:** Muscle pain (myalgia).


Less common side effects, with frequency not specified, include infections and reactivation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV).  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Fostemsavir is a prodrug; it's converted in the body to its active form, temsavir.  Temsavir is a gp120 attachment inhibitor.  This means it works by blocking the interaction between the HIV-1 virus and the CD4 receptors on human cells.  These receptors are crucial for the virus to enter and infect the cells. By preventing this attachment, temsavir inhibits viral entry and replication, thus helping to control the HIV infection.

### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Fostemsavir should not be used by individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or any of its components.  It's also contraindicated with concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (certain medications that increase the metabolism of other drugs).
* **Drug Interactions:** Fostemsavir interacts with many other medications, notably those metabolized by or affecting the CYP3A4 enzyme system, as well as other transporters such as OATP1B and BCRP.  Co-administration with certain drugs can significantly alter Fostemsavir's effectiveness or increase the risk of side effects.  Close monitoring by a healthcare provider is crucial if other medications need to be taken concurrently.  Consult with a pharmacist or doctor for detailed information on potential drug interactions.
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of elevated liver enzyme levels exists in patients with Hepatitis B or C virus co-infection. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is also a potential risk.  There's a possibility of QTc prolongation (a heart rhythm abnormality) with doses higher than recommended.  The risk of adverse reactions or loss of virologic response is increased due to drug interactions. Pregnancy and breastfeeding: The safety of Fostemsavir during pregnancy is not fully established.  Mothers should not breastfeed while taking this medication due to the potential for HIV transmission.

### FAQs
* **Q: Can I take Fostemsavir with food?** A: Yes, Fostemsavir can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store Fostemsavir?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. This typically involves storing it at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double up on doses.
* **Q: Is Fostemsavir safe for everyone?** A:  No, it is not suitable for everyone, especially those with certain allergies, liver or kidney problems, or who are taking interacting medications.  A doctor should assess suitability before prescribing.
* **Q: How effective is Fostemsavir?** A:  Fostemsavir's effectiveness depends on various factors, including the individual's overall health, adherence to the prescribed dosage, and the presence of any drug interactions. Its effectiveness in treating multidrug-resistant HIV is demonstrated in clinical trials but individual responses vary.  Regular monitoring of viral load is vital.
