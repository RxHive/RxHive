# Feracrylum
### Generic Name
Feracrylum

### Usage
Feracrylum is a versatile agent used primarily to control bleeding, particularly in the context of dental extractions and other oral surgeries where oozing blood is a concern.  Its actions extend beyond hemostasis; it also exhibits antiseptic and antimicrobial properties, helping to prevent infection in wounds.  While its primary use is in dentistry, its properties may find application in other situations requiring localized hemostasis and infection control.

### Dosage
Dosage varies depending on the specific application and the formulation of Feracrylum (solution or gel).  Generally, for bleeding related to dental extractions or oral surgeries, a thin film of a 1% solution or gel is applied topically to the affected area one to two times daily (OD or BID), morning and evening. Before application, the area should be cleaned with a sterile cloth.  Precise dosage instructions should always be followed as directed by a dentist or healthcare professional.  There is no specific pediatric dosage information available at this time.  Information regarding dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic or renal impairment is not currently provided in available manufacturer labeling.

### Side Effects
Common side effects, while not explicitly defined in terms of frequency, can include:

*   Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, stomach pain)
*   Skin reactions (burning sensation, allergic rash)

While rare, more serious side effects are possible.  Any unusual or concerning reactions should prompt immediate consultation with a healthcare provider.

### How it Works
Feracrylum's hemostatic effect stems from its ability to form a complex with albumin, a protein in the blood, accelerating clot formation and thus stopping bleeding.  Its antimicrobial action combats both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi, minimizing the risk of infection.  Furthermore, its hygroscopic nature contributes to faster wound healing, simplifies dressing removal, and stimulates the growth of granulation tissue, which is crucial for tissue repair.


### Precautions
Feracrylum is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to Feracrylum or any component of its formulation.  It should also be avoided in patients concurrently using epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA), a medication often used to control bleeding.  The safety and efficacy of Feracrylum during pregnancy and lactation are not fully established; therefore, caution is advised during these periods.   The topical formulation of Feracrylum is for external use only and should never be administered orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly.
