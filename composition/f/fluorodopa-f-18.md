# Fluorodopa F 18
### Generic Name
Fluorodopa F 18

### Usage
Fluorodopa F 18 injection is a radioactive diagnostic agent used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans.  Its primary use is to visualize dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum (a part of the brain involved in movement control). This helps in evaluating patients with suspected Parkinsonian syndromes.  The PET scan using Fluorodopa F 18 acts as a supplementary tool alongside other diagnostic tests to aid in diagnosis.


### Dosage
**Visualization of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum (Adults):**

*   An intravenous injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi) is administered over 1 minute.
*   The dose should be minimized while ensuring effective imaging, considering the capabilities of the imaging equipment used.

**Pediatric Dosage:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are specified by the manufacturer for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects
*   Injection site pain (frequency not defined).


While rare, serious side effects are possible due to the radioactive nature of the medication.  Any adverse effects should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Fluorodopa F 18 is a radioactive tracer. Once injected, it's converted to fluorodopamine (FDA) F 18 by an enzyme in dopaminergic nerve terminals.  Fluorodopamine is then stored in presynaptic vesicles. The accumulation of FDA F 18 in the striatum is detected by the PET scanner, creating an image that reflects the activity of dopamine neurons in the brain. This helps in assessing the level of dopamine function, crucial in the diagnosis of Parkinson's and similar conditions.


### Precautions

* **Interactions:** Using aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors (like carbidopa and benserazide) before Fluorodopa F 18 may increase its bioavailability in the brain.  Discontinuing dopamine agonists, dopamine-reuptake inhibitors, dopamine-releasing agents, peripheral COMT inhibitors, and MAO inhibitors 12 hours before the scan might minimize interference; however, this requires careful consideration of the potential risks involved in stopping these medications.  Always discuss medication adjustments with your doctor.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Safety and efficacy are not established in pregnant women.  There's a potential for fetal harm depending on the radiation dose and gestational age. If use is considered, inform the patient of the risks. The excretion of Fluorodopa F 18 in breast milk is unknown; to minimize infant exposure, temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding is advised for at least 24 hours after administration.  The benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against the potential risks.
* **Contraindications:**  No contraindications are explicitly listed in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Malignancy Risk:**  There is an increased risk of malignancy due to radiation exposure, inherent in the use of this radiopharmaceutical.
* **General:** Aseptic technique and radiation shielding are vital during handling and administration. Inspect the solution for particulate matter or discoloration before use.  Dispose of unused portions properly according to regulations.  Patients should not eat or drink (except water) for 4 hours before administration and should hydrate well before and after the procedure. Frequent urination is encouraged after the scan to reduce bladder radiation dose.  Administering 150 mg of carbidopa orally 60-120 minutes before the scan is often recommended.  Discontinue Parkinson's medications 12 hours prior to the scan unless medically inadvisable.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does the procedure take?** A: The actual injection is quick, but the whole PET scan process takes longer, typically around an hour or more.
* **Q: Will I feel anything during the injection?** A: You may feel a slight sting at the injection site.
* **Q: Are there any special dietary restrictions before the scan?** A:  Yes, avoid food and drink (except water) for at least 4 hours before the procedure.
* **Q: How long should I avoid breastfeeding after the scan?** A:  Consult your doctor, but it's usually recommended to avoid breastfeeding for at least 24 hours to minimize infant radiation exposure.
* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Contact your doctor immediately.
* **Q: How is the medication stored?** A:  Fluorodopa F 18 has a short half-life and must be handled and stored according to specific radiation safety guidelines, by trained professionals in a specialized facility.
