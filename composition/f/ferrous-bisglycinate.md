# Ferrous Bisglycinate
### Generic Name
Ferrous Bisglycinate

### Usage
Ferrous bisglycinate is primarily used to treat iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.  Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.  When iron levels are low, the body cannot produce enough healthy red blood cells, leading to anemia, characterized by fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Ferrous bisglycinate supplements help replenish iron stores, allowing the body to produce sufficient red blood cells and alleviate the symptoms of anemia.  It may also be used in food fortification to enhance iron content.

### Dosage
Dosage of ferrous bisglycinate varies depending on the individual's age, weight, severity of iron deficiency, and the specific formulation of the supplement.  A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage. Generally, adult dosages range from 30mg to 100mg of elemental iron per day, often divided into multiple doses. Children's dosages are significantly lower and must be determined by a pediatrician.  The medication is commonly available in tablet or capsule form.  Always follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist and on the product label. Do not exceed the recommended dosage.

### Side Effects
Common side effects of ferrous bisglycinate can include:

*   Constipation
*   Stomach upset (nausea, abdominal pain)
*   Dark stools (this is usually harmless)

Less common, but more serious side effects may include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), and in rare cases, severe gastrointestinal distress.  If you experience any concerning side effects, discontinue use and contact a healthcare professional immediately.


### How it Works
Ferrous bisglycinate is a chelated form of iron, meaning the iron is bound to amino acids (glycine). This chelation enhances iron absorption in the gut.  Once absorbed, iron is transported to the bone marrow where it is incorporated into hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells.  Increased iron levels lead to improved red blood cell production and alleviate symptoms associated with iron deficiency.

### Precautions
*   **Allergies:** Individuals with known allergies to iron or glycine should avoid using ferrous bisglycinate.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Ferrous bisglycinate can interact with certain medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and some calcium supplements. Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions if you are taking other medications.
*   **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:**  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should only take ferrous bisglycinate under the guidance of a healthcare provider, as appropriate iron levels are crucial during these periods.
*   **Gastrointestinal Conditions:** Individuals with pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, should exercise caution and consult with a healthcare professional before using ferrous bisglycinate.
*   **Children:**  Dosage for children needs to be strictly determined by a pediatrician.  Keep this supplement out of the reach of children.
*   **Overdose:**  Overdosing on iron can be dangerous.  Always follow prescribed dosage instructions.
