# Flumetasone
### Generic Name
Flumetasone

### Usage
Flumetasone is a corticosteroid used in combination with other medications, primarily clioquinol or salicylic acid, to treat various skin and ear conditions.  Its primary use is in the management of otitis externa (swimmer's ear), a common infection of the outer ear canal.  It's also effective against otomycosis (fungal ear infection) and corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, which are skin conditions that respond well to corticosteroids.  These dermatoses can include inflammatory and/or dysplastic skin diseases.  The combination with clioquinol offers an antimicrobial effect, helpful in treating infections often associated with these conditions.  The combination with salicylic acid adds keratolytic (skin-softening) properties, potentially improving penetration of the medication and aiding in the treatment of certain skin problems.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition being treated and the formulation used (Flumetasone with clioquinol or salicylic acid).  Always follow your doctor's prescription.

**Adults:**

* **Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (topical/cutaneous):** Flumetasone 0.02% + Clioquinol 1%: Apply a thin layer to the affected area 2-3 times daily for up to 7 days.
* **Inflammation of the external ear with suspected secondary infection (otic/aural):** Flumetasone 0.02% + Clioquinol 1%: Instill 2-3 drops twice daily directly into the affected ear canal for 7-10 days.
* **Inflammatory and/or dysplastic skin diseases (topical):** Flumetasone 0.02% + Salicylic acid 3%: Apply a thin layer to affected areas 1-2 times daily.  The duration of treatment will depend on the specific condition and response to treatment.


**Children:**

Use in children under 2 years old is contraindicated. For children older than 2 years, the dosage is generally the same as for adults, but always consult a pediatrician before using this medication in children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.


### Side Effects

Common side effects (frequency not specified):

* Skin rash
* Skin irritation
* Pruritus (itching)
* Burning sensation of the skin
* Skin atrophy (thinning)
* Acne vulgaris
* Telangiectasia (small dilated blood vessels)
* Dyschromia (discoloration of the skin)

*  Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage)


Less common but serious side effects:

* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Secondary infections
* Optic atrophy (damage to the optic nerve)
* Purpura (bruising)
* Thyrotoxicosis (overactive thyroid)

If you experience any adverse effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, discontinue use and consult your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Flumetasone is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the release of inflammatory chemicals in the body.  It acts by inhibiting phospholipase A2, an enzyme involved in inflammation.  This leads to a reduction in swelling, redness, and itching.

When combined with clioquinol, the antimicrobial properties of clioquinol help to fight bacterial and fungal infections that often accompany skin and ear conditions.  The addition of salicylic acid in some formulations provides keratolytic action, helping to soften and shed dead skin cells, allowing for better penetration of the flumetasone.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Flumetasone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any component (including iodine), primary bacterial, viral, or fungal infections of the outer ear, perforated eardrum, children under 2 years old, systemic fungal infections, untreated bacterial infections, tuberculosis, syphilis, rosacea, acne vulgaris, perioral dermatitis, and in cases of suspected or verified eardrum perforation (for otic use).  It should not be applied to eyes, ulcerated areas (topical application), or to areas with therapy-resistant secondary infections.

* **Warnings:** Increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, systemic effects, optic atrophy, Kaposi's sarcoma, adrenal suppression, and reduced growth velocity (in children).

* **Use with Caution:**  In patients with iodine intolerance, hepatic impairment, thyroid abnormalities, renal impairment, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and children.  Use only as directed by a healthcare professional.

* **Other Precautions:** Wash hands before and after application. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.  Do not use occlusive dressings with topical creams. Discontinue use if no improvement is seen after one week. Flumetasone and clioquinol preparations may stain skin and clothing.
