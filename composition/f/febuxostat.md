# Febuxostat
### Generic Name
Febuxostat

### Usage
Febuxostat is primarily used for the long-term management of hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood) in adults with gout.  It's specifically indicated for individuals who haven't responded adequately to allopurinol (another common gout medication), are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom allopurinol is deemed unsuitable.  Febuxostat works by lowering uric acid levels, thus reducing the frequency and severity of gout flares (sudden, painful attacks of inflammation in the joints).  It's important to note that febuxostat is not used to treat asymptomatic hyperuricemia (high uric acid without gout symptoms).

### Dosage
**Adults (Hyperuricemia):**  The usual starting dose is 40 mg once daily (OD).  If uric acid levels remain above 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the dose may be increased to 80 mg OD.  A further increase to 120 mg OD may be considered if clinically necessary.  It's crucial to start taking NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or colchicine alongside febuxostat for up to six months to help prevent gout flares.  Even if a flare occurs, febuxostat treatment usually doesn't need to be stopped.

**Children:** The safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in children have not been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**
* **Hepatic Impairment (Liver problems):**  For mild to moderate impairment, no dose adjustment is typically needed. For severe impairment, the manufacturer's label doesn't provide specific dosage adjustments; use should be cautious and under close medical supervision.
* **Renal Impairment (Kidney problems):** For mild to moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 30-89 mL/min), no dose adjustment is usually needed.  However, for severe impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the maximum dose is 40 mg OD.

### Side Effects
**Common (1-10%):**

* Nausea
* Skin rash
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Joint pain (arthralgia)

**Less Common (Frequency not specified, but can be serious):**

* Gout flares (acute attacks)
* More serious side effects are less common, but include liver problems, serious allergic reactions and cardiovascular issues, as detailed below.  Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately.

**Serious but Less Common (These require immediate medical attention):**

* Cardiovascular events (including death): A higher rate of cardiovascular death has been observed in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease taking febuxostat compared to allopurinol.  Discuss this risk with your doctor.
* Severe liver problems (hepatic failure)
* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis)
* Serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)


### How it Works
Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme that plays a key role in the production of uric acid. By inhibiting this enzyme, febuxostat reduces the body's production of uric acid, leading to lower uric acid levels in the blood.  This helps prevent the formation of urate crystals in the joints, which are the main cause of gout attacks. Importantly, febuxostat does not inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Febuxostat is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to febuxostat or any of its components. It should also not be used concurrently with azathioprine or mercaptopurine.
* **Warnings:**  There is an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.  Febuxostat should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment and those with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol.  A careful assessment of the risk-benefit ratio should be conducted before prescribing and regularly monitoring the patient.
* **Drug Interactions:** Febuxostat can interact with other medications, such as azathioprine, theophylline, pegloticase, mercaptopurine, and didanosine, potentially increasing their levels or effects.  Always inform your doctor about all other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Febuxostat is categorized as pregnancy category C. This means its effects during pregnancy are not well-understood. The excretion of febuxostat in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take febuxostat with food?** A:  Febuxostat can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  It may take several weeks to see a significant decrease in uric acid levels and a reduction in gout flares.  Regular monitoring of uric acid levels is essential.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store febuxostat?** A: Store it as directed on the label, typically in a cool, dry place, away from light and moisture.

* **Q: Can I stop taking febuxostat abruptly?** A: No, you should not stop taking febuxostat suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping it abruptly might lead to a worsening of your condition.
