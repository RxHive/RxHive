# Fat Emulsion (Fish Oil Based)
### Generic Name
Fat Emulsion (Fish Oil Based)

### Usage
Fat emulsion (fish oil based) is primarily used as a source of calories and essential fatty acids in pediatric patients (infants, children, and adolescents) with parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC).  PNAC is a liver condition that can develop in children receiving long-term intravenous nutrition. This medication helps to reduce bilirubin levels and improve liver function in these patients.  It is *not* indicated for use in adults.

### Dosage

**Pediatric Dosage (Parenteral Nutrition, Patients with PNAC):**

* **Route:** Intravenous (IV) infusion.
* **Dosage:** 1 g/kg/day.  Initiate as soon as direct or conjugated bilirubin levels reach ≥2 mg/dL in patients expected to need parenteral nutrition for ≥2 weeks.
* **Administration:**
    * Begin infusion slowly at ≤0.05 mL/min for the first 15-30 minutes. Gradually increase the rate as tolerated to the required dose over 30 minutes.  Do not exceed 1.5 mL/kg/h (0.15 g/kg/h).
    * Infusion should be completed within 12 hours when using a Y-connector with other solutions, and within 24 hours when administered as part of a premixed admixture.
    * Use a 1.2-micron in-line filter. DEHP-free administration sets and lines are recommended.
* **Hypertriglyceridemia:** If serum triglyceride levels exceed 250 mg/dL in infants or 400 mg/dL in older children, discontinue the infusion for 4 hours and resume as indicated by repeat triglyceride measurements. If triglyceride levels remain elevated, consider reducing the dose to 0.5-0.75 g/kg/day and gradually titrate upwards as tolerated.  The maximum dose remains 1 g/kg/day.
* **Duration:** Administer until direct or conjugated bilirubin levels are <2 mg/dL or until the patient no longer requires parenteral nutrition.


**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.


### Side Effects

* Nervous system: Agitation
* Cardiovascular: Bradycardia
* Dermatologic: Erythema
* Gastrointestinal: Vomiting
* Hematologic: Hemorrhage

* Nervous system: Hypertonia
* Dermatologic: Skin rash, catheter-site erythema
* Endocrine & Metabolic: Hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia
* Hematologic: Neutropenia
* Infection: Abscess


**Serious Side Effects (Less Frequent but Requiring Immediate Medical Attention):** Fat overload syndrome, parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), hypersensitivity reactions, refeeding syndrome.  Consult a healthcare provider immediately if any adverse effects occur.

### How it Works
Fat emulsion (fish oil based) provides a source of calories and essential fatty acids. The body metabolizes these fatty acids, which are necessary for the normal structure and function of cell membranes.  The provision of essential fatty acids, including omega-3 fatty acids like DHA and EPA, may help improve liver function in patients with PNAC.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to fish or egg protein, severe hemorrhagic disorders, severe hyperlipidemia or severe disorders of lipid metabolism characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride level >1000 mg/dL).
* **Warnings:** Increased risk of fat overload syndrome, PNALD, hypersensitivity reactions, refeeding syndrome, and hypertriglyceridemia.
* **Use with Caution:** In patients with anemia, bleeding disorders, hepatic impairment, and renal impairment.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Safety and efficacy have not been established in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  The decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risks of infant exposure and the benefits of breastfeeding and treatment to the mother.
