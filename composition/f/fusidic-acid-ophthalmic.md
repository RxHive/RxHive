# Fusidic Acid (Ophthalmic)
### Generic Name
Fusidic Acid (Ophthalmic)

### Usage
Fusidic acid ophthalmic is a topical antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the eye and conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelid).  It's primarily used for superficial infections in adults and children aged 2 years and older.  It is specifically *not* indicated for neonatal conjunctivitis (eye infections in newborns).  The medication targets bacterial infections, not viral or fungal ones.


### Dosage

**Adults and Children â‰¥2 years:**

* **Superficial ophthalmic infections/conjunctivitis:**  1 drop of 1% fusidic acid ophthalmic suspension in the affected eye(s) every 12 hours for 7 days.  If no improvement is seen after 7 days, a healthcare professional should be consulted for reassessment and potential change in treatment.


**Dosage Adjustments:**

The manufacturer's labeling does not provide specific dosage adjustments for patients with hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor if you have concerns about dosage based on your individual health conditions.

### How it Works

Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, meaning it stops the growth of bacteria rather than killing them directly. It achieves this by interfering with bacterial protein synthesis.  Specifically, it blocks the transfer of aminoacyl-tRNA (a crucial molecule in protein building) to proteins within susceptible bacteria, thus hindering their ability to multiply and spread the infection.


### Precautions

* **Contraindication:**  Fusidic acid ophthalmic is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to fusidic acid or any components of the formulation.
* **Increased Risk:**  There's an increased risk of superinfection (a new infection developing on top of an existing one, often by a different organism), including fungal infections, with the use of fusidic acid.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** The safety of fusidic acid ophthalmic during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established.  Use with caution and only after consulting a doctor.
* **General:** This medication is for topical use in the eye only. Avoid injecting it.  Proper handwashing before and after instillation is essential.  Patients should avoid touching the tip of the applicator to the eye or any other surface. Contact lens wear should be discontinued during treatment.
