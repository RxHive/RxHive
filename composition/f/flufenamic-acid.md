# Flufenamic Acid
### Generic Name
Flufenamic Acid

### Usage
Flufenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to relieve pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.  It's also employed in treating dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), migraine headaches (including ophthalmoplegic migraine), and to help prevent or delay premature labor.  While its primary use focuses on pain and inflammation management, its application in preventing premature labor highlights its impact on specific physiological processes.

### Dosage

Dosage varies greatly depending on the condition being treated and the route of administration (oral or topical).  **Always follow your doctor's prescription.**  This information is for general knowledge only and should not be considered medical advice.

**Oral Administration:**

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** 100 mg three or four times daily.
* **Osteoarthritis:** 100 mg four times daily.
* **Dysmenorrhea:** 200 mg three times daily.
* **Migraine Headache:** 125 mg four to six times per attack.  The maximum dose per episode should be determined by a physician.
* **Ophthalmoplegic Migraine:** 250 mg every two hours, not exceeding 1 gram during a single episode.  Consult a doctor immediately.
* **Premature Labor:** Initial dose of 200-400 mg, followed by 1-2 additional 200-400 mg doses at 1-2 hour intervals.  Maintenance dose: 800-1200 mg/day in four divided doses for four days.  Post-discharge, a 200 mg dose may be given if intense contractions return. For patients weighing less than 45 kg, the total daily dose is 10 mg/kg.


**Topical Administration:**

* **Pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders:**  The specific dosage will depend on the formulation (solution or ointment). A topical solution should be applied liberally to the affected area twice or thrice daily, rubbed in, and allowed to dry. For the ointment (3%), a 5-10 cm ribbon is applied thrice or twice daily to the affected area for up to three weeks.

**Pediatric Use:** Oral flufenamic acid is generally not recommended for children under 14 years of age and is contraindicated in infants and small children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  For patients with liver or kidney impairment, flufenamic acid should be used with caution, and the dosage may need adjustment under medical supervision.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, diarrhea, heartburn)
* Dizziness
* Photosensitivity

Less common but serious side effects may include:

* Acute proctocolitis
* Bone marrow toxicity
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including asthma)
* Skeletal fluorosis


If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Flufenamic acid works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. COX enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals that contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By blocking COX, flufenamic acid reduces the production of prostaglandins, thus alleviating pain and inflammation.  Crucially, flufenamic acid does not inhibit lipoxygenase, an enzyme responsible for leukotriene production, distinguishing its mechanism from some other NSAIDs.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Flufenamic acid is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to flufenamic acid, aspirin, or other NSAIDs; porphyria; active peptic ulcers;  a history of allergic reactions (such as rhinitis, urticaria/angioedema, asthma) to aspirin or other NSAIDs; and in infants and small children.
* **Interactions:** Flufenamic acid can interact with numerous medications, including oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, sulfonylureas, lithium, methotrexate, cardiac glycosides, ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, and quinolones.  These interactions can either enhance or diminish the effects of the other medication, sometimes significantly. Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Use during pregnancy is generally not recommended.  Flufenamic acid is excreted in breast milk, but the American Academy of Pediatrics considers it compatible with breastfeeding. Consult a physician.
* **Other Precautions:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of coagulation defects, gastrointestinal disease or ulceration, hypertension, cardiac conditions, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, or pre-existing infection.  For topical use, avoid excessive sun exposure to treated areas and contact with mucous membranes.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take flufenamic acid with other medications?** A:  No, you should always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you're taking before starting flufenamic acid.  There's a risk of harmful drug interactions.
* **Q: How should I store flufenamic acid?** A: Store flufenamic acid as directed on the label, usually in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's close to the next dose. Do not double the dose.
* **Q: Is flufenamic acid safe for long-term use?** A:  Long-term use of flufenamic acid may carry increased risks of certain side effects, such as bone marrow toxicity.  Your doctor will determine the appropriate duration of treatment.
* **Q:  Can I stop taking flufenamic acid suddenly?** A:  You should not stop taking flufenamic acid suddenly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping abruptly may cause withdrawal symptoms or worsen your condition.
