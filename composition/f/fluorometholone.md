# Fluorometholone
### Generic Name
Fluorometholone

### Usage

Fluorometholone is a corticosteroid used topically in the eye to treat inflammation.  Its primary use is to reduce inflammation in the structures at the front of the eye, including the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the inside of the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye), cornea (the clear front part of the eye), and the anterior segment of the globe (the front part of the eyeball).  It's effective against inflammation caused by various conditions, but it's crucial to understand that it doesn't treat the underlying cause of the inflammation; it only manages the symptoms.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the formulation (ointment or suspension), the severity of the inflammation, and the patient's age.  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's specific instructions.

**Adults:**

* **Ophthalmic Ointment (0.1%):** Apply a small amount (approximately a ½-inch ribbon) to the conjunctival sac 1-3 times daily.  The frequency may be increased to every 4 hours during the first 24-48 hours in more severe cases.
* **Ophthalmic Suspension (0.1%):** Instill 1-2 drops into the conjunctival sac 2-4 times daily.  The frequency can be increased to 2 drops every 2 hours or 1 drop every 4 hours during the initial 24-48 hours if needed.
* **Ophthalmic Suspension (0.25%):** Instill 1 drop into the conjunctival sac 2-4 times daily.  In severe cases, 1 drop every 4 hours may be used initially.


**Children (≥ 2 years):**

* Safety and effectiveness in children under 2 years old haven't been established.
* Dosage for children 2 years and older is generally similar to adult dosages, but always consult a pediatrician for guidance.  They may recommend a lower frequency or dosage based on the child's weight and the severity of the condition.

**Important Note:**  If there's no improvement within 2-14 days (depending on the severity), or if the condition worsens, consult your healthcare provider immediately.  In chronic conditions, the dosage frequency should be gradually reduced before stopping treatment altogether to prevent a flare-up.


### Side Effects

Common side effects:

* Burning sensation in the eyes
* Stinging of the eyes
* Eye irritation
* Itching (pruritus)
* Eye redness (erythema)
* Increased tearing (lacrimation)
* Eye pain
* Eye discharge
* Blurred vision
* Swelling of eyelids
* Foreign body sensation in the eye


Less common, but serious side effects:

* Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) – potentially leading to glaucoma
* Cataract formation
* Secondary infections (bacterial, fungal, or viral) –  the suppressed immune response from the corticosteroid can make the eye more susceptible to infection.
* Optic nerve damage
* Skin rash
* Hypercortisolism (rare, but potentially severe systemic effect)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those listed as serious, contact your doctor or ophthalmologist immediately.


### How it Works

Fluorometholone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation. It achieves this by suppressing the body's inflammatory response. It inhibits the release of substances (like prostaglandins and leukotrienes) that contribute to swelling, pain, and redness.  This helps to alleviate the symptoms associated with inflammation in the eye. The exact mechanism at the ocular level isn't fully understood but is believed to involve the inhibition of phospholipase A2, an enzyme involved in the inflammatory process.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Fluorometholone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to it or other corticosteroids, active viral infections of the eye (such as herpes simplex keratitis), fungal or mycobacterial eye infections, and untreated acute purulent eye infections.
* **Interactions:**  Some medications can interact with fluorometholone, potentially affecting its efficacy or causing adverse reactions. Inform your doctor of all medications (including over-the-counter drugs and supplements) you are taking.  NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), particularly ophthalmic formulations, can increase fluorometholone's effects.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fluorometholone is categorized as pregnancy category C, meaning its effects on pregnancy are unknown. Use during pregnancy should only occur if the potential benefits outweigh the risks, and the lowest effective dose should be used.  The excretion of fluorometholone in breast milk is unknown.
* **Glaucoma and Cataracts:**  Prolonged use of fluorometholone can increase the risk of glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure) and cataracts. Regular monitoring of intraocular pressure is often necessary, especially with prolonged treatment.
* **Other Precautions:** Patients with a history of herpes simplex should use this medication with caution.  Avoid touching the tip of the container to any surface to prevent contamination.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take for fluorometholone to work?**  A:  You might notice some improvement within a few days, but it often takes several days or weeks for the full effect to be seen.
* **Q: Can I use fluorometholone with contact lenses?** A: No, remove contact lenses before applying the medication and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting them (especially if using a solution containing benzalkonium chloride).
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Q: How should I store fluorometholone?** A: Store it as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q: Can I stop using fluorometholone when I feel better?** A: No, do not discontinue the medication without consulting your doctor, even if you feel better.  Stopping abruptly can cause a flare-up of inflammation.  The doctor will determine the appropriate time to gradually reduce the dosage and then stop treatment completely.
