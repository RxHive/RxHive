# Finafloxacin
### Generic Name
Finafloxacin

### Usage
Finafloxacin is a topical fluoroquinolone antibiotic.  Its primary use was in the treatment of acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear) caused by susceptible strains of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Staphylococcus aureus*.  It's important to note that finafloxacin has been discontinued from the United States market.  While it was under development for other uses, including the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs),  its availability for these indications is currently unavailable.


### Dosage
Because finafloxacin is no longer available in the US market, specific dosage information is not readily accessible for general use.  Prescriptions were previously tailored by healthcare professionals to individual patient needs.  The dosage would have depended on the severity of the infection and the patient's age and overall health. If a clinician had considered this medication appropriate, they would have provided specific instructions on how to use the medication.


### Side Effects
While finafloxacin is no longer available, the following side effects were reported during its use:

* **Common:** Burning or stinging sensation at the application site.
* **Less Common, but Potentially Serious:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling),  worsening of the infection.


**Important Note:** If any adverse effects occurred during the use of finafloxacin, it was crucial to seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works
Finafloxacin belongs to the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics.  It works by inhibiting bacterial enzymes called topoisomerase II and IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. By inhibiting these enzymes, finafloxacin prevents bacterial growth and ultimately kills the bacteria causing the infection.


### Precautions
Because finafloxacin is no longer marketed, comprehensive current precaution information is not readily available. However, as with other fluoroquinolones, precautions would likely have included:

* **Allergic reactions:** Individuals with known allergies to fluoroquinolones or any component of the formulation should avoid using finafloxacin.
* **Interactions with other drugs:**  Potential interactions with other medications could have existed; consulting a healthcare professional about any other medications being taken would have been essential.
* **Pregnancy and breastfeeding:**  Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding would have required careful consideration by a doctor, weighing the benefits against potential risks to the mother and child.
* **Children:** The safety and efficacy in children would likely have needed careful evaluation on a case-by-case basis.
* **Older adults:**  Older adults might have been more susceptible to some side effects; careful monitoring would have been necessary.
