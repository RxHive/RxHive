# Fosaprepitant

**Generic Name:** Fosaprepitant

**Usage:** Fosaprepitant is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy that contains highly emetogenic (vomiting-inducing) drugs.  It's typically given intravenously (IV) or as a subcutaneous injection before, and sometimes after, chemotherapy treatment.  It's often used in combination with other antiemetic medications for optimal effectiveness.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects of fosaprepitant include:

* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Constipation:** Difficulty passing stools.
* **Diarrhea:** Loose, watery stools.
* **Hiccups:** Involuntary spasms of the diaphragm.
* **Increased liver enzymes:**  This is usually temporary and monitored with blood tests.  It's important to inform your doctor if you experience jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
* **Hypersensitivity reactions:** Although rare, allergic reactions such as rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if this happens.
* **Other less common side effects:**  These can include headache, dizziness, pain at the injection site (if given subcutaneously or intravenously), and abdominal pain.


**How it Works:** Fosaprepitant is a prodrug, meaning it's converted into its active form, aprepitant, in the body.  Aprepitant works by blocking the substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor in the brain.  This receptor plays a crucial role in the vomiting reflex triggered by chemotherapy. By blocking this receptor, aprepitant prevents the signals that cause nausea and vomiting.


**FAQs:**

* **Is fosaprepitant the same as aprepitant?** No, fosaprepitant is a prodrug that converts to aprepitant.  Fosaprepitant is typically given intravenously or subcutaneously, while aprepitant is usually taken orally.

* **How long does the effect of fosaprepitant last?** The duration of action depends on the dose and route of administration.  Generally, its effects last for several days.

* **Can I take fosaprepitant with other medications?** It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.  Some interactions may occur.

* **What should I do if I miss a dose?**  Contact your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.

* **What are the long-term effects of fosaprepitant?**  Long-term effects are generally not a concern, but regular monitoring of liver function is often recommended during treatment.

* **Who shouldn't take fosaprepitant?**  People with known hypersensitivity to fosaprepitant or aprepitant should not take it.  Your doctor will assess your individual health conditions to determine if it's safe for you.
