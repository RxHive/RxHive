# Fosaprepitant
### Generic Name
Fosaprepitant

### Usage
Fosaprepitant is primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting or CINV).  It's a crucial part of antiemetic regimens, meaning it's used in combination with other anti-nausea medications for optimal effectiveness.  It's not used alone to treat nausea or vomiting from other causes.

### Dosage

**Adult Dosage (Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting):**

The dosage depends on the emetogenic potential (how likely it is to cause vomiting) of the chemotherapy regimen.

* **Highly emetogenic chemotherapy:** 150 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1, approximately 30 minutes before chemotherapy.  This is usually given in combination with a 5-HT3 antagonist (like ondansetron) on day 1 only, and with dexamethasone (a corticosteroid) on days 1-4 (the dexamethasone dose is often reduced by 50% on days 1 and 2).

* **Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy:** 150 mg IV on day 1 only, approximately 30 minutes before chemotherapy. This is combined with a 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone on day 1 (dexamethasone dose often reduced by 50%).


**Pediatric Dosage (Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting):**

Dosage varies significantly based on age and weight, and always requires careful calculation by a healthcare professional.  It's typically administered intravenously (IV) or orally (as aprepitant after IV fosaprepitant conversion). Dosages are adjusted based on whether a single-day or three-day NK1 receptor antagonist regimen is used.  Specific weight-based calculations are crucial and are best determined by an oncologist or pediatric oncologist.  Consult a healthcare professional for exact dosage information for children.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment (liver problems):**  Dosage adjustment is generally not needed for mild to moderate impairment, however for severe hepatic impairment, safety and effectiveness are not established, and close monitoring is necessary.

* **Renal Impairment (kidney problems):** Dosage adjustment is usually not necessary.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients):**

* Fatigue
* Diarrhea


**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in the extremities)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Urinary tract infection
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count), anemia (low red blood cell count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
* Infusion-site reaction
* Weakness
* Limb pain


**Rare but Serious Side Effects (less than 1%, often from post-marketing surveillance):**

* Anaphylactic shock
* Anaphylaxis
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Erythema (redness)
* Flushing
* Hypersensitivity reaction
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Pruritus (itching)
* Skin rash
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)
* Syncope (fainting)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe skin reaction)
* Urticaria (hives)

**Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  If you experience any adverse effects, consult your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fosaprepitant is a prodrug, meaning it's converted in the body to its active form, aprepitant. Aprepitant blocks the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, which is involved in the vomiting reflex triggered by chemotherapy.  By blocking this receptor, it prevents both acute (immediate) and delayed nausea and vomiting. It also works synergistically with other antiemetics like 5-HT3 antagonists and corticosteroids, enhancing their effectiveness.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fosaprepitant is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity (allergy) to fosaprepitant or any of its components. It should not be used with certain other drugs such as pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride due to potentially dangerous drug interactions.

* **Drug Interactions:** Fosaprepitant can interact with numerous medications, affecting their metabolism and blood levels.  It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications, herbal remedies, and supplements you are taking.

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Use caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fosaprepitant is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk but human studies are lacking. The decision to breastfeed while taking fosaprepitant should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider, weighing the benefits of treatment against potential risks to the infant.

* **Infusion Site Reactions:** Monitor for infusion-site reactions during intravenous administration.


### FAQs

* **Q: How is fosaprepitant administered?** A: It's usually given intravenously (IV) as a single dose before chemotherapy begins.

* **Q: Can I take fosaprepitant without a prescription?** A: No, fosaprepitant is a prescription medication. It requires a healthcare provider's evaluation to determine if it's appropriate for your condition and to determine the correct dose.

* **Q: How should fosaprepitant be stored?** A:  Follow the specific storage instructions on the medication label. Generally, it should be stored at a controlled room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.

* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your healthcare provider immediately if you miss a dose.  Do not attempt to double the dose.

* **Q:  Is fosaprepitant safe for everyone?** A: While generally safe when used as directed, fosaprepitant has potential side effects and contraindications.  It's essential to discuss your health history with your doctor to ensure it's a suitable medication for you.
