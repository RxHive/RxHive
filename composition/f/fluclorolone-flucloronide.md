# Fluclorolone/ Flucloronide
### Generic Name
Fluclorolone/Flucloronide

### Usage
Fluclorolone, a topical corticosteroid, is primarily used to treat various skin conditions responsive to corticosteroids. These include inflammatory dermatoses such as eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin reactions. It's effective in reducing inflammation, itching, and redness associated with these conditions.  While its primary use is for dermatological issues, it's important to remember that fluclorolone should only be used as directed by a healthcare professional.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:** For corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, the typical dosage involves applying a thin film of 0.2% cream or ointment to the affected area once or twice daily (OD or BID).  The exact frequency and duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the condition and the response to treatment, as determined by a doctor.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Fluclorolone is contraindicated for children under 1 year old. For children older than 1 year, the dosage is generally the same as for adults, but usage should always be under strict medical supervision.  A healthcare provider will determine the appropriate dosage and duration based on the child's age, weight, and the specific skin condition.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The safety and efficacy of fluclorolone in patients with hepatic or renal impairment haven't been established.  It's crucial to consult a doctor before using fluclorolone if you have liver or kidney disease.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of fluclorolone may include:

* Skin irritation
* Hypopigmentation (loss of skin color)
* Dryness
* Subcutaneous atrophy (thinning of the skin)
* Allergic reactions

Less common, but potentially serious side effects, are possible, especially with prolonged use or application to large skin areas.  These include:

* Increased risk of glaucoma and cataracts (with prolonged use)
* Cushing's syndrome (with systemic absorption)
* Hyperglycemia and glycosuria (with systemic absorption)
* Secondary skin infections

If any adverse effects occur, itâ€™s vital to discontinue use and seek immediate medical advice.


### How it Works
Fluclorolone is a synthetic corticosteroid that works by binding to specific receptors within skin cells. This binding process suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting the release of various inflammatory mediators like cytokines. By reducing the production and activity of these mediators, fluclorolone helps to decrease inflammation, itching, and redness associated with various skin conditions.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** Fluclorolone is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to fluclorolone or any component of the formulation. It should not be used on untreated bacterial, fungal, viral, or tubercular skin lesions; rosacea; perioral dermatitis; acne; or ulcerative conditions.  It's also contraindicated in children under one year of age.  Avoid use with occlusive dressings.
* **Drug Interactions:**  While specific drug interactions are not extensively documented, potential interactions with other topical medications applied to the same area should be considered and discussed with a healthcare provider.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Fluclorolone is categorized as Pregnancy Category C.  Its use during pregnancy is generally avoided unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. The medication is not recommended for use in lactating women.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use in children under one year of age is contraindicated.  Elderly patients and those with impaired liver or kidney function require careful monitoring when using fluclorolone.


### FAQs
* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the individual and the specific condition. Some improvement might be noticeable within a few days, but full benefit may take several weeks.
* **Q: Can I use fluclorolone on my face?** A:  Use on the face should only be under strict medical supervision due to increased risk of absorption and potential side effects.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose.  Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: How should I store fluclorolone?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight, as directed on the product label.
* **Q: Can I use fluclorolone with other skin creams or lotions?** A:  It's best to avoid using other topical products on the same area of skin without first consulting your doctor to prevent potential interactions or irritation.
