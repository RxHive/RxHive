# Finasteride
### Generic Name
Finasteride

### Usage
Finasteride is primarily used to treat two distinct conditions in men:

* **Male-pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia):**  Finasteride works by reducing the amount of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that plays a significant role in hair follicle miniaturization and hair loss.  By lowering DHT levels, it can help slow down hair loss and, in some cases, promote hair regrowth.  It's important to note that finasteride's effect on hair loss is primarily seen in the vertex (crown) and anterior mid-scalp areas; its effectiveness in treating bitemporal recession (receding hairline at the temples) hasn't been fully established.

* **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH):**  BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland, common in older men, causing urinary symptoms like frequent urination, weak stream, and incomplete bladder emptying. Finasteride shrinks the prostate by reducing DHT levels, which improves these urinary symptoms. It can be used alone or in combination with alpha-blockers, another class of drugs that also treat BPH symptoms.  Finasteride is *not* approved for prostate cancer prevention.

While not an approved indication, finasteride has been used off-label to treat hirsutism (excessive hair growth) in women.  This is typically done in conjunction with oral contraceptives and under close medical supervision due to potential risks.


### Dosage

**Androgenetic Alopecia (Male-pattern hair loss):**

* **Oral:** 1 mg once daily.  Treatment should continue for at least 12 months to assess its full effect.  Continuous daily use is necessary to maintain benefits.

**Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):**

* **Oral:** 5 mg once daily. This can be used as a single agent or in combination with an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist (like doxazosin).  Treatment for 6-12 months is usually needed to see symptom improvement.

**Hirsutism (Off-label use in women):**

* **Oral:** 2.5-5 mg once daily.  The response should be assessed every 6 months before adjusting the dose, adding other medications, or switching treatments.  It's often used with oral contraceptives and requires reliable birth control.


**Pediatric Use:**  Finasteride is not approved for use in children.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No dosage adjustments are generally recommended for patients with kidney problems. However,  individuals with liver impairment should use finasteride cautiously as it's extensively metabolized by the liver.  Always consult a doctor before taking finasteride if you have liver disease.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Impotence (difficulty getting or maintaining an erection)


**Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):**

* Decreased libido (sex drive)
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement)
* Ejaculatory disorders (changes in ejaculation)
* Decreased ejaculate volume
* Breast tenderness
* Rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal lining)
* Orthostatic hypotension (sudden drop in blood pressure when standing)
* Peripheral edema (swelling in the extremities)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* High-grade prostate cancer (rare but serious)


**Rare Side Effects (<1%, post-marketing reports):**

* Altered mental status
* Suicide attempts
* Breast hypertrophy (increased breast size)
* Depression
* Hypersensitivity reactions (allergic reactions)
* Male infertility (usually temporary)
* Suicidal ideation (thoughts of suicide)
* Testicular pain


**Important Note:** If you experience any adverse effects, especially those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor. This means it blocks the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which is responsible for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  DHT is a potent androgen (male hormone) that plays a significant role in both prostate enlargement and male-pattern hair loss. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride helps shrink the prostate in BPH and slows down or reverses hair miniaturization in androgenetic alopecia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing potential due to the risk of birth defects in male fetuses.  It's also contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to finasteride or its components.

* **Interactions:**  No significant drug interactions are currently known, but it's always essential to inform your doctor about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.

* **Warnings:**  There's an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer and suicidal ideation associated with finasteride, although this risk remains relatively low.  Patients should be monitored closely.  Use caution in patients with liver impairment.

* **Special Populations:** Pregnant women and women of child-bearing age must avoid contact with crushed or broken finasteride tablets.  Men using finasteride may experience temporary infertility; this usually reverses after stopping treatment.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking finasteride once my hair loss is controlled?**  A: No.  Stopping finasteride will likely lead to a return of hair loss.  Continuous daily use is required to maintain the benefits.

* **Q: How long does it take to see results from finasteride?** A:  For hair loss, it can take several months (even a year or more) to see noticeable results. For BPH, improvement in symptoms usually takes 6-12 months.

* **Q: How should I store finasteride?** A: Store finasteride at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep it out of reach of children.

* **Q: Is finasteride safe for long-term use?** A: While long-term use is common, itâ€™s crucial to have regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your health and address any potential side effects.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: Can I crush or break finasteride tablets?** A: No.  This is especially important for women of childbearing age who should avoid any contact with crushed or broken tablets due to the risk of birth defects. Men should also avoid crushing tablets.
