# Faropenem + Clavulanic Acid

There is no generic combination drug of Faropenem and Clavulanic Acid currently available on the market.  Faropenem is a carbapenem antibiotic, and clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor often combined with other beta-lactam antibiotics (like amoxicillin or ticarcillin) to broaden their spectrum of activity.  They are not typically used together.  Therefore, providing details in the requested format is not possible for a non-existent combination.
