# Flutamide
### Generic Name
Flutamide

### Usage
Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen primarily used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.  It's not used alone but in combination with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. This combination therapy works to suppress testosterone production, which is crucial in the growth and spread of prostate cancer cells.  Specifically, it's indicated for locally confined stage B2 to C and stage D2 metastatic prostate cancer.  While not its primary use, flutamide has been used off-label in treating hirsutism (excessive hair growth in women).  However, it's critically important to note that flutamide is **not** indicated for use in females except in very specific circumstances and under strict medical supervision.

### Dosage

**Important Note:** Flutamide is contraindicated in females, except under very specific and limited circumstances determined by a physician.

**Prostate Cancer (Metastatic):**  The typical adult dosage is 250 mg orally three times a day (every 8 hours),  always in combination with an LHRH agonist. For stage B2 to C prostate cancer, treatment (with both flutamide and goserelin) begins 8 weeks before radiation therapy and continues throughout the radiation course. For stage D2 metastatic prostate cancer, the combination therapy continues until disease progression is observed.

**Hirsutism (Off-Label Use):**  The off-label dosage for hirsutism is 250 mg orally once daily. This is not a standard or recommended use and should only be considered under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.

**Pediatric Use:** Flutamide hasn't been studied in children and isn't generally recommended for this population.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  However, flutamide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic (liver) impairment.  Flutamide and its active metabolite aren't well removed by dialysis.

### How it Works
Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen. It works by blocking the action of androgens (male hormones like testosterone) in the body.  By preventing androgens from binding to their receptors in prostate cancer cells, it inhibits the growth and spread of these cells.  This effect is amplified when used in conjunction with an LHRH agonist, which further reduces testosterone production.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Flutamide is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to flutamide or any of its components, and those with severe hepatic impairment. Baseline liver enzyme tests are essential before starting treatment.
* **Liver Toxicity:**  Flutamide carries a significant risk of liver damage, including potentially fatal liver failure. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is crucial throughout treatment. The medication should be stopped immediately if any signs of liver problems (e.g., jaundice, elevated liver enzymes) appear.
* **Drug Interactions:** Flutamide can increase the effects of warfarin (a blood thinner), increasing the risk of bleeding.  Concomitant use should be avoided or carefully managed.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Flutamide is categorized as Pregnancy Category D, meaning it poses a risk to the developing fetus. It should not be used during pregnancy. It's unknown whether flutamide is excreted in breast milk, and its use in breastfeeding women is contraindicated.
* **Other Precautions:**  Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels regularly during treatment. Patients with G6PD deficiency, hemoglobin M disease, or who are smokers are at increased risk of aniline toxicity.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take flutamide with food?** A: Flutamide can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store flutamide?** A:  Store flutamide as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and light.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for the next dose.  Never double up on doses.
* **Q: Are there any specific precautions for disposing of flutamide?** A: Follow your pharmacist’s or doctor’s instructions for proper disposal.  Never flush medications down the toilet or throw them in the trash unless specifically instructed to do so.
* **Q: Can I stop taking flutamide abruptly?** A: No, never stop taking flutamide abruptly without consulting your doctor.  Stopping suddenly can have serious consequences.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Report any side effects, especially serious ones like jaundice or severe liver problems, to your doctor immediately.
