# Fluticasone (Nasal)
### Generic Name
Fluticasone (Nasal)

### Usage

Fluticasone nasal spray is a corticosteroid medication primarily used to manage nasal symptoms associated with several conditions:

*   **Allergic rhinitis (hay fever):** This includes both seasonal (triggered by pollen, etc.) and perennial (year-round) allergic rhinitis. Fluticasone helps relieve symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, and itchy nose.  Over-the-counter (OTC) formulations are available for this purpose.

*   **Non-allergic rhinitis:** This is a condition causing similar nasal symptoms as allergic rhinitis but without an allergic trigger. Fluticasone can help manage these symptoms effectively.

*   **Nasal polyps:**  These are benign growths in the nasal passages that can cause nasal congestion, loss of smell, and other symptoms. Fluticasone can help reduce the size and inflammation of nasal polyps.


### Dosage

Fluticasone nasal spray comes in various formulations (different salts and strengths), so dosages vary significantly.  **It is crucial to follow the instructions on your specific prescription or OTC product label carefully.**  The following information provides a general overview and should not replace instructions from a healthcare provider:


**Adults:** Dosages depend heavily on the specific condition being treated and the formulation used.  For example, allergic rhinitis might start with 2 sprays per nostril once daily (OD), while nasal polyps may require 1-2 sprays per nostril twice daily (BID), with the maximum dose varying by formulation.  Your doctor will determine the right dosage for you, and this often starts with a lower dose, gradually increasing until symptoms improve.  Maintenance doses are typically lower than initial treatment doses.


**Children:**  The use of Fluticasone in children depends heavily on age and the specific formulation and condition. Dosages are generally lower than adult dosages and are strictly age-dependent, often starting with a single spray per nostril once daily.  Always consult a pediatrician before using Fluticasone in children.


**Administration:**  Most Fluticasone nasal sprays involve the following steps:

1.  Gently shake the bottle.
2.  Clear your nostrils by blowing your nose.
3.  Hold the bottle upright and insert the nozzle into one nostril.
4.  Close the other nostril.
5.  Inhale gently while spraying the medication into your nostril.
6.  Repeat for the other nostril as directed.

Specific instructions may vary slightly depending on the product. Always read the patient information leaflet provided with your medicine.

### How it Works

Fluticasone is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.  It does this by suppressing the release of various inflammatory substances (like histamines and prostaglandins) involved in allergic and inflammatory responses. By reducing inflammation, Fluticasone helps relieve nasal congestion, sneezing, itching, and runny nose.  It's crucial to understand it primarily acts locally within the nose; its systemic effects are generally minimal with nasal administration.


### Precautions

*   **Allergies:** Do not use Fluticasone if you are allergic to it or any of its ingredients.
*   **Infections:**  Use with caution if you have any active or recent infections in your nasal passages or respiratory system.  Fluticasone may mask symptoms of infection.
*   **Children:**  Use in children should only be under the supervision of a pediatrician due to potential growth suppression.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While generally considered safe in pregnancy, consult your doctor before using it.  Its effects on breastfeeding are not fully established.
*   **Other Medications:** Some medications may interact with Fluticasone.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, vitamins, and supplements you are taking.
*   **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe liver disease.
*   **Long-term use:**  Prolonged use may increase the risk of certain side effects.  Regular monitoring might be needed.



### FAQs

*   **How long does it take to work?** The effects of Fluticasone are not immediate. It may take several days or even weeks to see full benefit, depending on the condition and dosage.

*   **Can I use it more frequently than prescribed?** No. Increasing the dose or frequency without consulting your doctor may increase the risk of side effects without significantly improving efficacy.

*   **How should I store it?** Store Fluticasone as directed on the label, typically at room temperature, away from heat and moisture.

*   **What if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.

*   **Can I use it with other nasal sprays?**  Consult your doctor before combining Fluticasone with other nasal medications to avoid interactions or reduce efficacy.

*   **What should I do if I experience side effects?** Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you experience any concerning side effects.
