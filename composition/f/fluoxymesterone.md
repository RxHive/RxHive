# Fluoxymesterone
### Generic Name
Fluoxymesterone

### Usage
Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroid primarily used for treating conditions related to low testosterone levels in males. Its main uses include:

* **Male hypogonadism:** This condition occurs when the testes don't produce enough testosterone, leading to various symptoms. Fluoxymesterone helps replace the missing testosterone.
* **Delayed puberty in males:**  In boys who are experiencing delayed or incomplete puberty, Fluoxymesterone can stimulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics and promote sexual maturation.
* **Palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer in females:**  While not a cure, Fluoxymesterone can be used to help manage symptoms and slow the progression of certain types of advanced breast cancer in women.  This is a secondary and less common use.


### Dosage

Fluoxymesterone is administered orally.  Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition and the patient's response.  It's crucial to follow a healthcare professional's instructions precisely.  

**Adults:**

* **Delayed Puberty (Males):** 2.5-20 mg/day for 4-6 months.
* **Hypogonadism (Males):** 5-20 mg/day.
* **Palliative Breast Cancer (Females):** 10-40 mg daily, divided into multiple doses, for at least 3 months.


**Children and Adolescents:**

Dosage for delayed puberty and hypogonadism in children and adolescents aged 12 and older is generally the same as for adults, but careful consideration of the child's chronological and skeletal age is essential for initial dosage and any adjustments.  A doctor will determine the appropriate dosage.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments are not routinely recommended for those with mild to moderate liver or kidney problems; however, close monitoring is required.  The medication should be discontinued if any signs of liver problems occur (such as jaundice or abnormal liver function tests). Fluoxymesterone is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney disease.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects:**  These can include:

* Anxiety
* Depression
* Headaches
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Acne
* Hair loss (androgenetic alopecia)
* Changes in libido (increased or decreased)
* Fluid retention
* Edema (swelling)


**Serious but Less Common Side Effects:**  These require immediate medical attention:

* Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Blood clots (thromboembolic events)
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males)
* Virilization in females (development of male characteristics)
* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium)
* Severe allergic reactions

If you experience any side effects, especially serious ones, seek medical advice immediately.


### How it Works

Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic derivative of testosterone. It acts as an androgen, binding to androgen receptors in various tissues throughout the body. This binding triggers various effects, including:

* Stimulation of protein synthesis:  Leading to muscle growth and increased bone density.
* Development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics: Such as increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, and growth of facial and body hair.
* Stimulation of bone growth:  Important in delayed puberty.
* Inhibition of estrogen production in some cancers:  Contributing to its palliative role in breast cancer.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluoxymesterone is contraindicated in individuals with severe liver or kidney disease, breast or prostate cancer, and women who are pregnant or may become pregnant.  It should also be avoided by individuals with known allergies to fluoxymesterone.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fluoxymesterone can interact with several medications, including blood-glucose-lowering drugs, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and vitamin K antagonists.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Warnings:**  This medication can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate underlying heart conditions.  Those with a history of heart problems, diabetes, or sleep apnea should use it with caution and under strict medical supervision.  Close monitoring for cardiovascular events is essential. Regular blood tests to monitor liver function, blood counts, and lipid levels are usually recommended.  Women taking this medication should be closely monitored for signs of virilization.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fluoxymesterone is a Category X drug, meaning it is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of severe harm to the developing fetus.  Its excretion in breast milk is unknown, so caution is advised.
