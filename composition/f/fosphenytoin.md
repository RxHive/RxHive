# Fosphenytoin
### Generic Name
Fosphenytoin

### Usage

Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, primarily used to control seizures. Its main application is in managing generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition involving continuous seizures.  It's also valuable for preventing and treating seizures that can occur during neurosurgery, such as craniotomies.  In situations where oral phenytoin isn't feasible, Fosphenytoin can provide short-term parenteral treatment for focal-onset (partial) and generalized-onset seizures.  While not its primary indication, it is sometimes used off-label for the prevention of early post-traumatic seizures following traumatic brain injury.

### Dosage

**Always prescribe and dispense Fosphenytoin as phenytoin sodium equivalents (mg PE); 1 mg PE is equivalent to 1 mg phenytoin sodium.**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the situation and the patient's characteristics.  Here's a summary, but *always consult the prescribing information for precise instructions*:


**Adults:**

* **Status epilepticus:**  The manufacturer recommends a loading dose of 15-20 mg PE/kg administered at 100-150 mg PE/minute IV.  This is often followed by maintenance doses of either Fosphenytoin or phenytoin.  Other seizure control measures, like benzodiazepines, are usually needed concurrently. The American Epilepsy Society and Neurocritical Care Society suggest a 20 mg PE/kg loading dose at a rate of 100-150 mg PE/minute IV, with a benzodiazepine, and continuous cardiac and blood pressure monitoring.  Adjustments may be needed based on patient response and potential side effects.  A maximum loading dose of 30 mg PE/kg may be used.
* **Non-emergent seizures:** Loading doses typically range from 10-20 mg PE/kg (IV rate: Infuse more slowly such as over 30 minutes) with a maximum rate of 150 mg PE/minute. Maintenance doses are usually 4-6 mg PE/kg/day divided. The rate of IV administration should not exceed 150 mg PE/minute.
* **Seizures after craniotomy:**  A loading dose of 10-20 mg PE/kg IV (≤150 mg PE/min) before surgery is often used, followed by postoperative prophylaxis (5-7.5 mg PE/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses).
* **Short-term alternative to oral therapy:**  Loading doses (optional) of 10-20 mg PE/kg over 24 hours may be used, followed by maintenance dosing.

**Children:** Dosage adjustments are needed for children based on their weight and age. Always consult a pediatrician or the prescribing information for precise pediatric dosing guidelines.  These will vary based on the specific condition being treated (status epilepticus, maintenance, or prophylaxis after traumatic brain injury).

**Administration:** Fosphenytoin is administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). IV administration is generally preferred, especially for urgent situations like status epilepticus.  Intramuscular administration should generally not be used in status epilepticus due to slower absorption compared to IV.  The IV infusion rate should not exceed 150 mg PE/minute in adults to minimize cardiovascular risks.


**Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided for hepatic or renal impairment in the manufacturer's labeling.  However, close monitoring of free phenytoin levels is crucial in patients with these conditions, or hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels), as clearance may be affected.

### Side Effects

**Common (≥10%):**

* Nervous system: Burning sensation, paresthesia, dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia
* Dermatologic: Pruritus (itching)
* Ophthalmic: Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements)

**Less Common (1-10%):**  A wide range of side effects are possible, affecting many organ systems. These include but are not limited to: headache, nausea, vomiting, various skin rashes, cardiovascular effects (hypotension, tachycardia), and various neurological effects (confusion, tremor, etc.).


**Serious but Less Common (<1%):**  Severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis),  severe cardiovascular events, severe dermatological reactions, and hepatotoxicity are possible, though rare.


**If any adverse effects occur, consult a healthcare professional immediately.**

### How it Works

Fosphenytoin is a prodrug, meaning it's converted in the body to the active drug, phenytoin. Phenytoin stabilizes neuronal membranes, reducing the excessive electrical activity that causes seizures. It achieves this by affecting the movement of sodium ions across cell membranes, impacting nerve impulse generation.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Fosphenytoin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it, phenytoin, other hydantoins, or any formulation component; sinus bradycardia; sinoatrial block; second- or third-degree AV block; Adams-Stokes syndrome; a history of acute hepatotoxicity from Fosphenytoin or phenytoin; and concurrent use with delavirdine.
* **Warnings:**  There's a boxed warning about the risk of severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias with rapid IV infusion rates. Careful cardiac monitoring is essential.  There is also an increased risk of blood dyscrasias, cardiovascular events, dermatological reactions (including severe, life-threatening ones like TEN and SJS), hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity, local toxicity, lymphadenopathy, multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, and sensory disturbances.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Fosphenytoin interacts with numerous other medications.  Consult a healthcare professional and refer to the drug monograph for detailed information on potential interactions.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:**  Fosphenytoin is a Category D drug in pregnancy.  There's a risk of congenital malformations and adverse fetal outcomes. Effective contraception is advised for women of reproductive age. Excretion in breast milk is unknown.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Fosphenytoin with other medications?** A: Fosphenytoin interacts with many medications.  Always inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Q: How should I store Fosphenytoin?** A: Follow the storage instructions on the product label.  Usually, this involves storing it at room temperature, away from light and moisture.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Consult your healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. Do not attempt to double up on doses.
* **Q: Is Fosphenytoin addictive?** A: Fosphenytoin is not considered an addictive substance.  However, sudden discontinuation should be avoided as it can lead to seizures.
* **Q: Can I drive or operate machinery while taking Fosphenytoin?** A: Drowsiness and dizziness are common side effects. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how Fosphenytoin affects you.
