# Fesoterodine Fumarate

**Generic Name:** Fesoterodine Fumarate

**Usage:** Fesoterodine fumarate is used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is a condition characterized by urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence (leakage of urine).  It helps to relax the bladder muscle, allowing it to hold more urine and reducing the urge to urinate frequently.


**Side Effects:**  Like all medications, fesoterodine fumarate can cause side effects, although not everyone experiences them.  Common side effects include:

* **Dry mouth:** This is a very common side effect.
* **Constipation:**  Difficulty passing stool.
* **Dry eyes:**  Can lead to discomfort and blurred vision.
* **Dizziness:**  Feeling lightheaded or unsteady.
* **Blurred vision:** Impaired vision.
* **Headache:**  Pain in the head.
* **Nasal congestion:** Stuffy nose.
* **Dry skin:**  Dryness and itchiness of the skin.
* **Somnolence (sleepiness):** Feeling unusually tired or drowsy.


Less common but more serious side effects include:

* **Angle-closure glaucoma:** A serious eye condition.  This is especially important for individuals with pre-existing glaucoma or a predisposition to it.
* **Urinary retention:** Inability to urinate. This is a serious side effect requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Heat stroke:**  This risk is increased in hot environments.
* **Severe allergic reactions:** These are rare but can be life-threatening.


**How it Works:** Fesoterodine fumarate is an anticholinergic medication.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates bladder contractions. By blocking acetylcholine, fesoterodine fumarate relaxes the bladder muscle, reducing the frequency and urgency of urination.
