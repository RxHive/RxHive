# Fesoterodine Fumarate
### Generic Name
Fesoterodine Fumarate

### Usage
Fesoterodine fumarate is primarily used to treat overactive bladder (OAB).  OAB is a condition characterized by urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence (the inability to hold urine long enough to reach a toilet).  It works by relaxing the muscles in the bladder, allowing it to hold more urine and reducing the urge to urinate frequently. While its primary use is for OAB, it may sometimes be considered for other conditions related to bladder dysfunction, but this should always be determined by a healthcare professional.  The effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate can vary depending on the individual and the severity of the OAB symptoms.

### Dosage

Dosage of fesoterodine fumarate varies depending on individual needs and the form of the medication.  Always follow your doctor's instructions.

**Oral:**

* **Adults:** The typical starting dose is 4 mg once daily.  This may be increased to 8 mg once daily if needed and tolerated by the patient.  Your doctor will monitor your response and adjust the dosage accordingly.  
* **Children:** Fesoterodine fumarate is not typically recommended for use in children, as its safety and effectiveness have not been established in this age group.

**IV:** Fesoterodine fumarate is not available in an intravenous (IV) form. It is administered orally only.


**Important Note:**  Elderly patients, those with kidney or liver problems, and those on certain other medications may require a lower starting dose or more frequent monitoring.  Always inform your doctor of all medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, before starting fesoterodine fumarate.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of fesoterodine fumarate can include:

* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Dizziness
* Blurred vision
* Headache
* Nausea
* Dry eyes


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Urinary retention (inability to urinate)
* Glaucoma worsening
* Heat intolerance

If you experience any of these side effects, especially if they are severe or persistent, consult your doctor or healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works

Fesoterodine fumarate is an anticholinergic medication.  It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the bladder muscles to contract. By blocking acetylcholine, fesoterodine fumarate relaxes the bladder muscles, reducing the urge to urinate frequently and improving bladder control.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fesoterodine fumarate should not be used by individuals with untreated narrow-angle glaucoma, severe gastrointestinal conditions like toxic megacolon or paralytic ileus, or those with urinary retention.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fesoterodine fumarate can interact with other medications, particularly those that affect the central nervous system or that have anticholinergic properties. Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The use of fesoterodine fumarate during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with your doctor. The potential risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed.
* **Elderly Patients:** Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of fesoterodine fumarate and may require lower doses.
* **Liver and Kidney Impairment:** Patients with liver or kidney problems may need dosage adjustments due to altered drug metabolism and excretion.
