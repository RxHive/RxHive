# Fluticasone Propionate + Azelastine
### Generic Name
Fluticasone Propionate + Azelastine

### Usage
Fluticasone propionate and azelastine is a combination nasal spray used to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children 12 years of age and older.  This includes symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, itchy/watery eyes, and nasal congestion.  Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the nasal passages, while azelastine is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  By combining these two medications, this spray provides both anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic effects to manage allergy symptoms more effectively than either drug alone.  It's primarily used for seasonal allergies, but may offer some relief from perennial allergic rhinitis in some individuals; however, a physician should always be consulted for diagnosis and treatment plan.


### Dosage
**Adults and Children 12 years and older:** The usual dose is two sprays in each nostril once daily.  The medication should be used regularly, even when symptoms improve, to maintain symptom control.  Do not exceed the recommended dose.  This medication comes in a nasal spray form only.  There is no oral or IV form of this specific combination drug.  Specific instructions on priming the nasal spray bottle should be carefully followed as detailed in the package insert.

**Children under 12 years of age:** This combination medication is not approved for use in children under 12 years old.


### Side Effects
**Common Side Effects:**

* Nasal burning or stinging
* Headache
* Nosebleeds
* Nasal dryness
* Cough
* Bad taste in the mouth


**Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**

*  Allergic reactions (such as rash, swelling, difficulty breathing) - seek immediate medical attention if this occurs.
*  Increased risk of infections (particularly fungal infections in the nose) - prolonged use may increase this risk.


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above, or any other unusual symptoms, contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately.


### How it Works
Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages. It decreases the production of inflammatory substances, thereby lessening swelling, congestion, and irritation. Azelastine is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. Histamine is responsible for many allergy symptoms, such as sneezing, itching, and runny nose. By blocking histamine's effects, azelastine helps relieve these symptoms. The combined action of these two medications provides broader and more effective allergy relief than either medication alone.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:** This medication should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to fluticasone propionate, azelastine, or any of the inactive ingredients in the formulation.  
* **Drug Interactions:**  While generally well-tolerated, potential interactions with other medications are possible.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and vitamins, that you are currently taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant. The safety of this combination in pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.
* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more susceptible to some side effects.  Careful monitoring may be necessary.
* **Patients with Liver or Kidney Disease:** The effects of this medication in patients with impaired liver or kidney function have not been fully studied.  Caution should be exercised in these populations.
