# Fluticasone Propionate + Azelastine

**Generic Name:** Fluticasone Propionate/Azelastine Nasal Spray

**Usage:**

Fluticasone propionate/azelastine nasal spray is a combination medication used to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children 12 years of age and older.  These symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose, itchy/watery eyes, and congestion. It's important to note that it does *not* treat the underlying allergy itself.  It's typically used daily, as directed by a doctor, during allergy seasons.


**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Nosebleeds
* Headache
* Burning/stinging sensation in the nose
* Bad taste in the mouth
* Cough
* Throat irritation
* Nasal dryness


Less common but more serious side effects can occur and require immediate medical attention. These include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Increased risk of infections (due to suppression of the immune system by fluticasone)


**How it Works:**

This combination medication works in two ways:

* **Fluticasone Propionate:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It works by reducing inflammation in the nasal passages.  It helps to decrease swelling and mucus production, thereby relieving congestion and other symptoms.
* **Azelastine:** This is an antihistamine. It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction.  Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of hay fever, such as itching, sneezing, and runny nose.

By combining these two active ingredients, the medication provides both anti-inflammatory and antihistamine effects for more comprehensive allergy symptom relief.

* **Can I use this medication long-term?**  Long-term use should be discussed with your doctor.  While it's commonly used for allergy seasons, prolonged use can increase the risk of side effects.
