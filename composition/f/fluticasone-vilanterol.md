# Fluticasone  + Vilanterol
### Generic Name
Fluticasone + Vilanterol

### Usage

Fluticasone and Vilanterol is a combination inhaler used for the long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This includes conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It's also used to reduce the frequency of COPD exacerbations (worsening of symptoms) in patients with a history of these events. Importantly, this medication is *not* for the quick relief of sudden breathing problems (acute bronchospasm).  While sometimes used off-label for asthma in some regions, its primary and officially approved use is for COPD.


### Dosage

**Adults (COPD):** The usual dose is one inhalation of Fluticasone 100 mcg/vilanterol 25 mcg once daily.  This is the only strength approved for COPD.  There are other strengths for asthma treatment, but those are not addressed here.


**Adults (Asthma - Off-Label Use):**  Dosage varies depending on asthma severity and prior treatment.  A healthcare professional should guide the specific dosage. The maximum dosage is typically one inhalation per day.


**Children:** Fluticasone and Vilanterol is not approved for use in children.  The safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.


**Administration:**  This medication comes as a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Follow the instructions provided with your inhaler carefully. Generally, you exhale completely, then take a long, slow, deep breath through the mouthpiece while holding the inhaler appropriately.

### How it Works

Fluticasone furoate is a corticosteroid. It reduces inflammation in the airways, making it easier to breathe. Vilanterol is a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA). It relaxes the muscles around the airways, further improving airflow.  Together, they provide both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating effects to manage COPD symptoms.


### Precautions

* **Hypersensitivity:**  Do not use this medication if you are allergic to fluticasone, vilanterol, or any of the ingredients.
* **Cardiovascular Disease:** Use with caution in patients with heart conditions.
* **Diabetes:**  Monitor blood sugar levels closely as this medication may affect blood glucose.
* **Hepatic Impairment:**  Use cautiously in patients with liver problems as fluticasone levels might be increased.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Inform your doctor about all medications you are taking, especially other inhalers. Some interactions may occur.
* **Children:** Do not use in children.
* **Osteoporosis:**  Long-term use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of osteoporosis.


### FAQs
