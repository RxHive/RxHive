# Formoterol

**Generic Name:** Formoterol

**Usage:**

Formoterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) bronchodilator used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It's typically used in combination with other medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, for optimal management of these conditions.  It is *not* for the immediate relief of an acute asthma attack.

**Side Effects:**

Common side effects include:

* Headache
* Tremor (shaking)
* Muscle cramps
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
* Throat irritation
* Cough

Less common but more serious side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Paradoxical bronchospasm (worsening of breathing)
* Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
* High blood pressure
* Low potassium levels
* Increased blood sugar levels


**How it Works:**

Formoterol relaxes and opens the airways in the lungs. It works by binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing the muscles around the airways to relax. This increases airflow into and out of the lungs, making breathing easier. The long-acting nature means its effects last for several hours, providing sustained bronchodilation.

**FAQs:**

* **Can I use formoterol to treat an asthma attack?** No. Formoterol is a preventative medication, not a rescue medication.  Use a short-acting beta2-agonist (like albuterol) for immediate relief of asthma symptoms.
* **How often should I use formoterol?**  The dosage and frequency depend on your specific condition and doctor's prescription.  It's usually taken once or twice daily.
* **Can I suddenly stop taking formoterol?** No.  Stopping abruptly can worsen your condition.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for tapering off the medication.
* **What should I do if I miss a dose?** Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.
* **Can I use formoterol if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  Talk to your doctor. The risks and benefits should be carefully considered.
* **Can I drink alcohol while taking formoterol?**  Moderate alcohol consumption is generally not a concern, but excessive alcohol use should be avoided as it can exacerbate some side effects.  It's best to discuss this with your doctor.
* **Can formoterol interact with other medications?** Yes, formoterol can interact with other medications, including some heart medications, diuretics, and certain antidepressants.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
