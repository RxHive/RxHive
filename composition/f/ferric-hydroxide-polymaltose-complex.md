# Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex
### Generic Name
Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex

### Usage
Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex is primarily used to treat iron-deficiency anemia, particularly when oral iron supplements are poorly tolerated, contraindicated, or ineffective due to impaired intestinal absorption.  It's also employed for the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency and anemia in general.  This makes it useful in various situations, from treating anemia in pregnant women to addressing iron deficiency in individuals with malabsorption syndromes.

### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly based on the route of administration (oral, intramuscular [IM], or intravenous [IV]), the patient's age and weight, and whether it's for treatment or prevention of iron deficiency anemia.  Always follow your doctor's prescribed dosage.  The following information is for general understanding and should not be considered medical advice.  

**Adult Dosage (expressed as elemental iron, which is approximately 28% of oral and 31% of injectable products):**

* **Iron-deficiency anemia prevention:** Oral: 50-100 mg/day; IM: 100 mg every other day until the total dose is reached (maximum 200mg per dose, >48 hours apart); IV:  A test dose (25mg) is administered before the full therapeutic dose, which may be a single infusion diluted in 500mL of normal saline.  The IV route is generally less preferred than IM.
* **Iron-deficiency anemia treatment:** Oral: 100-300 mg/day; Pregnant women: 200-300 mg/day until target hemoglobin is reached, then 100mg/day until the end of pregnancy; IV and IM doses for treatment are calculated based on desired and observed hemoglobin levels and body weight, as determined by your doctor.


**Pediatric Dosage (expressed as elemental iron):**  Dosage is highly dependent on age and weight and the form of the medication (oral solution/drops, syrup, chewable tablets). Consult a pediatrician for the appropriate dosage for your child.  Dosage forms like solutions and syrups are typically used for infants and young children, while tablets might be more suitable for older children and adolescents.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  Currently, specific dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment aren't provided in manufacturer's labeling;  use with caution in these populations under close medical supervision.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Oral):**

* Fecal discoloration (more than 10% of patients)
* Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia (indigestion), nausea (1-10% of patients)

**Less Common but Potentially Serious Side Effects (Oral and Injectable):**

* Allergic reactions (ranging from mild skin reactions to severe anaphylaxis) requiring immediate medical attention.  Anaphylaxis is more associated with injectable forms.
* Injection site reactions (pain, inflammation) with IM administration.
* Cardiovascular effects like chest pain, low blood pressure, fast heart rate, fainting (more common with injectable forms).


This is not an exhaustive list. If you experience any side effects, consult your doctor or pharmacist.

### How it Works

Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex delivers iron to the body.  Iron is absorbed into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (part of the immune system).  There it is converted into a usable form (Fe³⁺), transported to the bone marrow via transferrin (an iron-transporting protein), and incorporated into hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells). Some iron is also stored as ferritin and hemosiderin or used in other iron-containing proteins.  By increasing iron availability, it helps the body produce more red blood cells, thus treating iron deficiency anemia.

### Precautions

**Contraindications:**  Ferric Hydroxide Polymaltose Complex is contraindicated in individuals with:

* Hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
* Anemia not caused by iron deficiency (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, hemolytic anemia).
* Iron overload (hemochromatosis).
* Certain other medical conditions such as severe liver or kidney disease, uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism, and others.  See your doctor for a complete list.
* First trimester of pregnancy (for IV administration).


**Warnings/Precautions:**

* Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, liver or kidney problems, inflammatory diseases, or diabetes.
