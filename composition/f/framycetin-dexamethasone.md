# Framycetin + Dexamethasone

**Generic Name:** Framycetin + Dexamethasone

**Usage:** This combination is a topical antibiotic and corticosteroid used to treat bacterial skin infections that are accompanied by inflammation and/or itching. It's commonly used for conditions like:

* Infected eczema
* Impetigo
* Secondary bacterial infections of other skin conditions (e.g., psoriasis, burns)


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary depending on the individual and the length of treatment. Common side effects include:

* **Burning or stinging sensation:** at the application site.
* **Skin thinning (atrophy):** with prolonged use, especially in sensitive areas.
* **Skin discoloration:**  May occur with long-term use.
* **Increased risk of infection:**  Suppression of the immune response by the corticosteroid can make the skin more susceptible to fungal or viral infections.
* **Striae (stretch marks):**  Possible with prolonged or high-potency use.
* **Folliculitis:**  Inflammation of hair follicles.
* **Allergic reactions:**  Rash, itching, swelling.  These are rare but possible.

**Less common, but more serious side effects may include:**

* **Systemic absorption:**  Although generally minimal with topical use, absorption can occur, leading to systemic corticosteroid effects (e.g., Cushing's syndrome symptoms if used extensively or on large areas of skin).
* **Glauccoma and cataracts:**  (if used near the eyes)


**How it Works:**

* **Framycetin:** This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately killing the bacteria causing the infection.  It's effective against a range of Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.

* **Dexamethasone:** This is a corticosteroid (a type of steroid). It reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response in the skin. This helps to alleviate the symptoms associated with the infection.  The combined action of the antibiotic and the steroid provides both infection control and symptom relief.


**FAQs:**

* **How long should I use it?**  Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Treatment duration varies depending on the severity of the infection and the response to treatment.  Generally, it's not recommended for prolonged use.

* **Can I use it on my face?**  Use only as directed by your doctor.  The face is a sensitive area, and prolonged use of topical steroids can have adverse effects.

* **What should I do if I experience side effects?**  Stop using the medication and consult your doctor immediately.

* **Can I use it during pregnancy or breastfeeding?**  Consult your doctor. The use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should only be considered if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.

* **Can I use other skin products with it?** Check with your doctor or pharmacist before using other topical medications or skincare products concurrently, as interactions are possible.

* **What if I miss a dose?** Apply the medication as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Where should I store it?**  Store it at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight. Keep out of reach of children.
