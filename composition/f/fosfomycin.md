# Fosfomycin
### Generic Name
Fosfomycin

### Usage

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against a range of bacteria.  Its primary use is in treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), specifically acute cystitis, in women.  This means it's suitable for bladder infections that haven't spread to the kidneys and are not complicated by other factors like kidney stones or weakened immune systems.  

Importantly, oral fosfomycin is *not* recommended for UTIs that involve the kidneys (pyelonephritis) or surrounding tissue (perinephric abscess).  Parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) fosfomycin has a broader range of applications, including more severe infections such as bacterial meningitis, osteomyelitis (bone infection), hospital-acquired pneumonia, and complicated UTIs.  In some cases, it might be used off-label for conditions like chronic bacterial prostatitis or as prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs.  However, always follow a healthcare professional's guidance on its use.


### Dosage

Dosage varies significantly depending on the infection being treated, the route of administration (oral or intravenous), and the patient's age and weight.  Precise instructions must come from a doctor or other qualified healthcare provider.  The following information is for general knowledge only and should not be interpreted as a prescription:

**Adults:**

* **Oral (Uncomplicated UTI):** Typically a single 3-gram dose.  For multi-drug resistant UTIs,  it may be given as 3 grams every 2-3 days for a total of three doses. For continuous prophylaxis (off-label use),  it may be 3 grams every 7-10 days.
* **Intravenous (Complicated UTI, Meningitis, Osteomyelitis, Pneumonia):**  Doses range from 12 to 24 grams per day, divided into 2-3 doses.  The maximum single dose is usually 8 grams.  Higher doses may be necessary for severe infections caused by less susceptible bacteria.

**Children:**  Dosage for children is weight-based and significantly lower than adult doses.  It must be determined by a physician.  Generally, intravenous administration uses doses ranging from 200-400 mg/kg/day, divided into 3-4 doses,  adjusted based on the child's weight and the specific infection.


**Important Considerations:** Oral fosfomycin should be mixed with 3-4 ounces of cool water before ingestion and should not be administered in its dry form or mixed with hot water.  Intravenous formulations require specific infusion times, typically ranging from 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the dose.  Always follow the instructions provided with the medication and by your healthcare professional.



### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in 1-10% of patients) may include:

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Vaginitis (vaginal infection)
* Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)
* Back pain
* Weakness

Less common but more serious side effects are possible, including:  anaphylaxis, angioedema, abnormal stools, liver damage, and gastrointestinal issues like toxic megacolon (a severe and potentially life-threatening condition).  If you experience any serious or unusual side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

### How it Works

Fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic.  This means it kills bacteria rather than just inhibiting their growth.  It achieves this by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Specifically, it inhibits an enzyme called pyruvyl transferase, which is crucial for the formation of peptidoglycan, a vital component of bacterial cell walls.  Disrupting this process leads to bacterial cell death.


### Precautions

* **Allergy:** Fosfomycin should not be used by individuals with a known allergy to it or any of its components.
* **Kidney and Liver Function:**  Fosfomycin is primarily excreted through the kidneys.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with impaired kidney function.  Liver function should also be monitored, especially with high doses or prolonged use.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fosfomycin is categorized as pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies have not shown risk, but human studies are lacking.  It is excreted in breast milk, so breastfeeding is generally not recommended while using fosfomycin.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fosfomycin may interact with other medications.  It is crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Superinfection:**  Like other antibiotics, fosfomycin can disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the body, potentially leading to superinfection (a new infection caused by a different organism).
* **Electrolyte Imbalance:**  Be aware that fosfomycin can potentially affect electrolyte balance in the body.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take fosfomycin with food?** A: Oral fosfomycin can be taken with or without food.
* **Q: How should I store fosfomycin?** A: Store fosfomycin as directed on the product label, typically at room temperature, away from moisture and heat.
* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Consult your healthcare provider for guidance. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
* **Q: Is fosfomycin effective against all types of bacterial infections?** A: No, fosfomycin's effectiveness varies depending on the specific bacteria causing the infection.  A culture and sensitivity test is crucial for determining its suitability.
* **Q: How long does it take to work?** A:  The onset of effects varies depending on the infection and route of administration.  However, improvement should be noticeable within a few days.
