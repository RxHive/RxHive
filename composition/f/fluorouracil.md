# Fluorouracil

**Generic Name:** Fluorouracil (5-FU)

**Usage:** Fluorouracil is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various cancers, including:

* **Colorectal cancer:** Often used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs or as adjuvant therapy (after surgery).
* **Breast cancer:**  May be used alone or in combination with other treatments.
* **Stomach cancer:**  Used in combination with other therapies.
* **Pancreatic cancer:** Often part of a combination regimen.
* **Head and neck cancer:** Used in various treatment settings.
* **Bowel cancer:** Similar applications to colorectal cancer.
* **Skin cancer (topical):**  Used in topical formulations to treat certain skin cancers.


**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary widely depending on the dosage and individual patient factors. Common side effects include:

* **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores (stomatitis), loss of appetite, abdominal pain.  These are often dose-limiting side effects.
* **Hematologic:** Low white blood cell count (leukopenia), low red blood cell count (anemia), low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) â€“ increasing the risk of infection and bleeding.
* **Skin:**  Rash, redness, dryness, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).  Topical use can cause irritation at the application site.
* **Neurological:**  Headache, fatigue, dizziness, numbness, tingling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy).
* **Other:**  Hair loss (alopecia), changes in taste, mucositis (inflammation of mucous membranes).


**How it Works:** Fluorouracil is an antimetabolite.  It works by interfering with the synthesis of RNA and DNA, essential components for cell growth and reproduction.  Cancer cells are rapidly dividing, and fluorouracil preferentially affects these cells, leading to their death.  It is a pyrimidine analog, meaning it's structurally similar to uracil, one of the building blocks of RNA and DNA.  The body incorporates fluorouracil into RNA and DNA, disrupting their normal function and hindering cell replication.

**FAQs:**

* **Is fluorouracil a targeted therapy?** No, it's considered a cytotoxic chemotherapy drug, meaning it kills rapidly dividing cells generally, not specifically targeting cancer cells alone.
* **How is fluorouracil administered?** It can be administered intravenously (IV), topically (for skin cancer), or orally (less common).
* **What are the long-term side effects?**  Long-term side effects are possible, and can include heart problems, secondary cancers (rare), and persistent neurological issues.  Regular monitoring is crucial.
* **Can fluorouracil be taken with other medications?**  Drug interactions are possible.  It's essential to inform your doctor about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **What are the precautions?**  People with liver or kidney problems may need careful monitoring.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications.
