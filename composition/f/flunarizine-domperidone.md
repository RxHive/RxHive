# Flunarizine + Domperidone

**Generic Name:** Flunarizine + Domperidone

**Usage:** This combination is not a standard, commercially available fixed-dose combination.  Flunarizine and Domperidone are used separately to treat different conditions.  A doctor *might* prescribe them together in specific cases, but this is off-label and requires careful monitoring.

* **Flunarizine:** Primarily used to prevent migraine headaches and also sometimes used for vertigo (dizziness) and Meniere's disease.
* **Domperidone:** Primarily used to relieve nausea and vomiting, and to improve gastric emptying in conditions like gastroparesis.  It's also sometimes used to treat symptoms of reflux.


**Side Effects:**  The side effects listed below are for the *individual* drugs, not necessarily the combination. Side effects when taken together could be additive or interactive.  It is crucial to consult a doctor if considering this combination.

* **Flunarizine:**  Common side effects include drowsiness, weight gain, depression, extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders), and rarely, tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements).
* **Domperidone:** Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, dry mouth, and rarely, extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders),  prolactin elevation (leading to galactorrhea - milky nipple discharge, amenorrhea - absence of menstruation, gynecomastia - breast enlargement in men).  In rare cases, serious heart rhythm problems can occur.


**How it Works:**

* **Flunarizine:**  It's a calcium channel blocker that affects the release of calcium ions in brain cells. This helps to stabilize blood vessels in the brain, reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. Its effect on vertigo may be related to its influence on vestibular function.
* **Domperidone:** It's a dopamine antagonist that blocks dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. This action reduces nausea and vomiting and promotes gastric motility (the movement of food through the stomach).
