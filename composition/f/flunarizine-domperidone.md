# Flunarizine + Domperidone
### Generic Name: Flunarizine + Domperidone

This combination medication isn't typically found as a single, pre-mixed generic. Flunarizine and Domperidone are usually prescribed separately.  However,  information on each component will be provided to understand the potential combined effects when used together under doctor's supervision.


### Usage

**Flunarizine:** Primarily used to prevent migraine headaches. It's thought to work by affecting calcium channels in the brain, stabilizing blood vessel function and reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks.  It may also be used off-label in some cases for vertigo and Meniere's disease, but this needs to be discussed with a physician.

**Domperidone:**  A prokinetic agent that primarily improves gastrointestinal motility.  It works by blocking dopamine receptors in the gut, thus stimulating gastric emptying and relieving symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and bloating. It is often prescribed for functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis and to help with nausea and vomiting associated with other conditions.


### Dosage

**Flunarizine:** Dosage varies based on individual needs and the specific condition being treated. It's typically started at a low dose and gradually increased as tolerated.  The usual adult dose is 5-10mg daily, usually taken once daily at bedtime.  There is limited data on pediatric use, and it's generally not recommended for children.  Flunarizine is usually administered orally as a tablet.

**Domperidone:**  Dosage depends on the condition being treated and the patient's age and weight.  Adult dosage for nausea and vomiting is usually 10-20mg three or four times daily, taken before meals and at bedtime.  For children, the dosage is determined by weight and should be prescribed by a doctor. It's available as oral tablets, syrup, and injectable forms.  The injectable form is typically administered by a healthcare professional.

**Combined Use:**  A physician would prescribe the exact dosage of each medication separately, considering the patient's specific health status and needs.  There is no standardized combined dosage form of Flunarizine and Domperidone.


### Side Effects

**Flunarizine:** Common side effects include drowsiness, weight gain, depression, and extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders).  Less common, but more serious, side effects can include agranulocytosis (low white blood cell count) and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements).

**Domperidone:** Common side effects are mild and include headache, diarrhea, and dry mouth.  Less common side effects may include breast tenderness, galactorrhea (milk production), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and rarely, cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).  Prolonged use can increase the risk of cardiac side effects.


### How it Works

**Flunarizine:**  Works by blocking calcium channels in the brain's blood vessels. This helps to stabilize blood vessel function, reducing the constriction and dilation associated with migraine headaches.

**Domperidone:**  Blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, increasing the rate of gastric emptying and reducing nausea and vomiting.


### Precautions

**Flunarizine:** Not recommended for individuals with Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders.  Should be used cautiously in patients with depression or a history of depression.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully considered and only under strict medical supervision.  It can cause drowsiness and impair judgment, so driving or operating machinery may be affected.

**Domperidone:** Should not be used for prolonged periods due to the risk of cardiac side effects.  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be carefully weighed against the benefits.  It should be used cautiously in individuals with liver or kidney impairment.  It can interact with certain medications, including those that affect the heart rhythm.
