# Ferrous Calcium Citrate
### Generic Name
Ferrous Calcium Citrate

### Usage
Ferrous calcium citrate is primarily used as an iron supplement to treat iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.  Iron deficiency, a common condition, occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron to produce sufficient hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Iron-deficiency anemia is a type of anemia resulting from this deficiency, leading to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Ferrous calcium citrate helps replenish iron stores, allowing the body to produce more hemoglobin and alleviate the symptoms of these conditions.


### Dosage

**Supplementation (Oral):**

* **Adults:**  Typically, one capsule or 5 mL (depending on formulation) per day is recommended.
* **Children:** The dosage for children is also typically one capsule or 5 mL per day, but this should always be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's age, weight, and specific needs.


**Dosage Adjustments:** The provided information doesn't specify dosage adjustments for hepatic (liver) or renal (kidney) impairment.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist for guidance if you have liver or kidney disease.

### Side Effects

Common side effects may include:

* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Black stools (this is generally harmless but can be alarming)


Less common, but potentially serious side effects, are rare but possible.  It is important to note that this information is not exhaustive, and other side effects can occur. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any unusual or concerning symptoms.

### How it Works

Ferrous calcium citrate works by providing the body with readily absorbable iron.  Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells. By increasing iron levels in the blood, ferrous calcium citrate helps the body produce more hemoglobin, thus improving oxygen-carrying capacity and addressing the underlying cause of iron deficiency anemia.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ferrous calcium citrate is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with hemolytic anemia (unless iron deficiency anemia is also present), hemochromatosis (iron overload), hemosiderosis (iron deposits in organs), peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, regional enteritis (Crohn's disease), and those receiving frequent blood transfusions.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Ferrous calcium citrate can interact with certain medications, such as antacids and tetracyclines.  It's crucial to inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Lactation:** Maternal iron requirements increase during pregnancy. While generally safe, it's crucial to discuss usage during pregnancy and breastfeeding with a healthcare professional.  Iron is present in breast milk.
* **General Precautions:** Administer ferrous calcium citrate 30 minutes before meals to enhance absorption.


### FAQs

* **Q: How should I store ferrous calcium citrate?** A: Store it as directed on the product label, typically in a cool, dry place away from moisture and direct sunlight.
