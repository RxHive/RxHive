# Floctafenine
### Generic Name
Floctafenine

### Usage
Floctafenine is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for the short-term management of mild to moderate acute pain.  It's primarily used for pain relief, but its anti-inflammatory properties may provide some benefit in reducing inflammation associated with the painful condition.  However, it's crucial to understand that floctafenine is not intended for long-term pain management or chronic inflammatory conditions.


### Dosage
**Adults:** The typical oral dose is 200-400 mg every 6-8 hours as needed, but the maximum daily dose should not exceed 1200 mg.  Dosage adjustments are not specifically defined for hepatic or mild-to-moderate renal impairment; however, extreme caution and close monitoring are necessary.  Floctafenine is contraindicated in patients with significant hepatic impairment, active liver disease, or severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).

**Children:**  The safety and efficacy of floctafenine have not been established in children, and therefore, it is not recommended for pediatric use.


### Side Effects
Common side effects can include:

* Nervous system: Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, nervousness, vertigo
* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, heartburn
* Cardiovascular: Edema, flushing, tachycardia
* Dermatological: Skin rash, pruritus
* Other:  Fluid retention, increased thirst


Less common, but potentially serious side effects include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Kidney problems (renal insufficiency, interstitial nephritis)
* Blood disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis)
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)


If you experience any of these side effects, especially serious ones, discontinue use and seek immediate medical attention.


### How it Works
Floctafenine works by reversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes. These enzymes are involved in the production of prostaglandins, which contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, floctafenine provides analgesic (pain-relieving), anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects.  Additional mechanisms, such as impacting chemotaxis and lymphocyte activity, may also contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects.


### Precautions
**Contraindications:** Floctafenine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to floctafenine, aspirin, other NSAIDs, or any component of the formulation; active peptic ulcer; active inflammatory gastrointestinal disease; severe cardiac insufficiency or ischemic cardiomyopathy; significant hepatic impairment or active liver disease; severe renal impairment; concurrent use with other NSAIDs; severe heart failure, coronary heart disease; concurrent use with beta-blockers; nasal polyp syndrome; and a history of aspirin triad.

**Interactions:**  Floctafenine can interact with numerous medications, including other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and others.  It's crucial to inform your doctor of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking before starting floctafenine.

**Warnings:** Increased risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke), gastrointestinal events (ulcers, bleeding), and allergic reactions exists.  Use caution in patients with fluid retention, those concurrently using aspirin or anticoagulants, smokers, alcohol consumers, the elderly, and those with decreased hepatic function.  Avoid tasks requiring alertness if experiencing CNS side effects.  Pregnancy: Use in late pregnancy may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.  Breastfeeding: Floctafenine is excreted in breast milk and should be avoided during breastfeeding.


### FAQs

**Q: How long can I take floctafenine?**

A: Floctafenine is intended for short-term use only.  Do not take it for longer than prescribed by your doctor.

**Q: Can I take floctafenine with alcohol?**

A:  Combining floctafenine with alcohol is generally discouraged, as it can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other adverse effects.

**Q: How should I store floctafenine?**

A: Store floctafenine according to the instructions provided on the product label. This typically involves storing it in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

**Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?**

A: If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose. Do not double the dose to make up for a missed one.
