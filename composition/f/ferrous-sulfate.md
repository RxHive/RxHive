# Ferrous Sulfate
### Generic Name
Ferrous Sulfate

### Usage
Ferrous sulfate is primarily used to treat and prevent iron-deficiency anemia.  This condition occurs when the body doesn't have enough iron to produce sufficient red blood cells, leading to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.  Ferrous sulfate provides the body with the iron it needs to produce healthy red blood cells.

While its primary use is in treating iron deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate has also been used off-label for restless legs syndrome (RLS) in some cases, particularly when iron deficiency contributes to the condition.  However, its use for RLS is not universally accepted, and a healthcare provider should determine if this is an appropriate treatment option.

### Dosage

**Note:**  Dosage is often expressed in terms of elemental iron, which is approximately 20% of the weight of ferrous sulfate.  Different formulations (tablets, liquids) contain varying amounts of elemental iron, so carefully read the product label and follow the instructions provided by your healthcare professional.

**Adults:**

* **Iron-deficiency anemia treatment:** 65-200 mg of elemental iron per day, divided into up to three doses.  The exact dose and duration depend on the severity of the anemia and individual response.  Longer treatment courses (over six months) should only be considered for individuals with ongoing blood loss (like heavy menstrual bleeding).  Older adults may benefit from lower doses (15-50 mg elemental iron/day) to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.  Immediate-release forms are preferred.
* **Iron-deficiency anemia prevention (off-label):**  30-60 mg elemental iron per day for three consecutive months yearly, may be recommended in specific situations and geographic locations with high anemia prevalence.
* **Restless Legs Syndrome (off-label):** 65 mg elemental iron (equivalent to approximately 325 mg of ferrous sulfate) twice daily, often in conjunction with vitamin C, may be considered for individuals with low ferritin levels (â‰¤75 ng/mL).  This is an off-label use, and its efficacy and safety should be carefully considered with a doctor.

**Children:**

Dosage for children varies greatly depending on age and weight.  It's crucial to follow the specific recommendations provided by a pediatrician or healthcare professional.  In general:

* **Iron-deficiency anemia prevention:**  Doses range from 1 mg/kg/day in infants (over 4 months) to 30-60 mg/day in older children, often for 3 months per year in areas with high anemia prevalence.
* **Iron-deficiency anemia treatment:** 3-6 mg/kg/day, divided into three doses, with a maximum of 200 mg/day.


**Administration:**  Oral ferrous sulfate is typically taken with a glass of water or juice.  Taking it between meals generally improves absorption, although it may be taken with food if gastrointestinal upset occurs.  Avoid taking it with dairy products, tea, or coffee as these substances can interfere with iron absorption.


### Side Effects

* **Common:**  Darkening of stools, abdominal pain, heartburn, constipation, gas, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* **Less Common but Serious:** While rare, more severe reactions are possible.  Consult a healthcare professional immediately if you experience any unusual symptoms.

### How it Works

Ferrous sulfate supplies the body with iron, a vital component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.  By replenishing iron stores, ferrous sulfate enables the production of more red blood cells, thereby improving oxygen-carrying capacity and alleviating symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ferrous sulfate should not be used by individuals with hemochromatosis (iron overload), hemolytic anemia (a condition where red blood cells are prematurely destroyed), or a known allergy to iron salts.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Numerous medications can interact with ferrous sulfate, potentially affecting its absorption or effectiveness.  Antacids, certain antibiotics, and other medications can reduce iron absorption.  Inform your healthcare professional of all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Iron needs increase during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  While ferrous sulfate is generally considered safe during these periods, the dose should be determined by a healthcare provider.
* **Children:** Accidental iron overdose is a significant risk for young children; keep this medication out of their reach.
* **Older Adults:** Older adults may be more susceptible to gastrointestinal side effects; lower doses may be necessary.
* **Other Precautions:**  Individuals with peptic ulcers, colitis, or enteritis should use ferrous sulfate with caution.

### FAQs

* **Q:  How long does it take to see results from taking ferrous sulfate?** A:  It can take several weeks or months to see significant improvement in anemia symptoms, depending on the severity of the deficiency.
* **Q:  What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
* **Q:  How should I store ferrous sulfate?** A: Store it in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and direct sunlight.
* **Q:  Can I take ferrous sulfate with other supplements?** A:  Some supplements may interfere with iron absorption; consult your healthcare provider before combining ferrous sulfate with other supplements.
* **Q:  What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Mild side effects like constipation or upset stomach are common.  If side effects are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare professional immediately.
