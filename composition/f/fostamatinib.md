# Fostamatinib
### Generic Name
Fostamatinib

### Usage
Fostamatinib is a medication used to treat thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).  Specifically, it's indicated for those who haven't responded adequately to other treatments.  ITP is a condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets, leading to easy bruising, bleeding, and an increased risk of serious hemorrhage. Fostamatinib works by targeting a specific part of the immune system's response that contributes to this platelet destruction.


### Dosage
**Adult Dosage:**  The starting dose of Fostamatinib is typically 100 mg twice daily (BID). If the platelet count doesn't rise to at least 50,000/mmÂ³ after a month, the doctor may increase the dose to 150 mg BID.  The goal is to reach and maintain a platelet count sufficient to reduce the risk of bleeding. Treatment is generally discontinued after 12 weeks if this target isn't met.  Dosage adjustments are necessary based on side effects, particularly liver enzyme abnormalities (ALT and AST) and hypertension.  These adjustments involve reducing the dose or temporarily stopping treatment. Specific dose reduction schedules are provided in the prescribing information to guide clinicians.

**Pediatric Dosage:** Fostamatinib is not recommended for children under 18 years old due to potential adverse effects on growing bones.

**Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments are crucial based on several factors:

* **Hepatic Impairment:** While no formal dose adjustment is specified for mild to moderate hepatic impairment, close monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is essential.  Significant liver enzyme elevations may necessitate dose reduction or treatment interruption.
* **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is generally needed for patients with renal impairment.
* **Toxicity Management:** Dose reduction is often required to manage side effects like diarrhea, hypertension, and neutropenia (low white blood cell count).  The prescribing information outlines specific guidelines for dose adjustments in these situations.

The medication is administered orally, taken with or without food.  If a dose is missed, take the next dose as scheduled; do not double the dose.


### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (>10%):**

* Respiratory tract infections

**Less Common but Serious Side Effects (1-10% or less, but requiring attention):**

* Fatigue

* Hypertensive crisis
* Syncope (fainting)
* Abdominal pain
* Skin rash
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Febrile neutropenia (fever with low white blood cell count)
* Increased serum AST levels (liver enzyme)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Limb pain
* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)
* Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
* Hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels)


Any new or worsening symptoms should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works
Fostamatinib inhibits spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), an enzyme crucial in the immune system's signaling pathways. In ITP, the immune system mistakenly attacks platelets, leading to their destruction.  By blocking SYK, Fostamatinib interferes with these damaging immune responses, allowing platelet counts to recover. Its major active metabolite, R406, plays a significant role in this process by reducing antibody-mediated platelet destruction.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fostamatinib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to the drug or its components and in pregnant women.
* **Drug Interactions:** Fostamatinib interacts with certain medications, particularly those metabolized by liver enzymes (CYP3A4, BCRP, P-gp).  Consult with a doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Fostamatinib can harm a developing fetus.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the final dose. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose.
* **Hepatotoxicity and Hypertension:** Fostamatinib can cause liver damage (hepatotoxicity) and high blood pressure (hypertension).  Regular monitoring of liver function tests and blood pressure is crucial.
* **Other Precautions:** Close monitoring for neutropenia is also recommended.  Patients should report any signs of infection promptly.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take Fostamatinib with food?** A: Yes, Fostamatinib can be taken with or without food.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for the next dose. Do not double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store Fostamatinib?** A: Follow the storage instructions provided on the medication label. Typically, this involves storing it in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.

* **Q: Are there any long-term effects of Fostamatinib?** A:  Long-term effects are not fully known.  Regular monitoring by your doctor is important.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A:  Contact your doctor immediately to discuss any side effects, especially those that are severe or persistent.
