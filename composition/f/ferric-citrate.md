# Ferric Citrate
### Generic Name
Ferric Citrate

### Usage
Ferric citrate serves a dual purpose in managing specific conditions related to iron and phosphorus levels:

* **Primary Use: Hyperphosphatemia in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Patients on Dialysis:**  Its primary role is to control high levels of phosphorus in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) in adult CKD patients undergoing dialysis.  High phosphorus levels are a common and serious complication of CKD, and ferric citrate helps to manage this by binding to phosphorus in the digestive tract, preventing its absorption and promoting its excretion in the stool.

* **Secondary Use: Iron-Deficiency Anemia in CKD Patients *Not* on Dialysis:** Ferric citrate is also used to treat iron-deficiency anemia in adult CKD patients who are *not* on dialysis.  In this context, it provides iron to replenish depleted iron stores and increase hemoglobin levels, improving oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.


### Dosage

**Important Note:** Each tablet contains 210 mg of ferric iron, equivalent to 1 gram of ferric citrate.  Dosage adjustments should be made under the close supervision of a healthcare professional based on individual patient response and lab results.

**Adults:**

* **Hyperphosphatemia (CKD patients on dialysis):**
    * **Initial Dose:** Typically, 2 tablets (420 mg ferric iron) three times a day (TID).
    * **Maintenance Dose:**  The dose is adjusted up or down by 1 or 2 tablets (210-420 mg ferric iron) at intervals of one week or more, as needed, to achieve the target serum phosphorus level.  
    * **Maximum Dose:** 12 tablets per day (2520 mg ferric iron).

* **Iron-Deficiency Anemia (CKD patients *not* on dialysis):**
    * **Typical Dose:** 1 tablet (210 mg ferric iron) three times a day (TID).
    * **Dose Adjustment:** The dose is titrated (adjusted) as needed to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin level.
    * **Maximum Dose:** 12 tablets per day (2520 mg ferric iron).


**Children:** The safety and efficacy of ferric citrate in children have not been established.  It should not be used in pediatric patients.


### Side Effects

* **Common Side Effects (>10%):** Darkening of stools, diarrhea, constipation, nausea.
* **Less Common Side Effects (1-10%):** Vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood).

**Serious Side Effects:** While less frequent, iron overload can occur, particularly with prolonged use or in individuals with pre-existing conditions affecting iron metabolism.  Always report any concerning side effects to a healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Ferric citrate works differently depending on its application:

* **In hyperphosphatemia:** Ferric iron in the medication binds to phosphate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, forming an insoluble compound (ferric phosphate). This insoluble compound is not absorbed into the bloodstream and is eliminated in the feces, thus lowering serum phosphorus levels.

* **In iron-deficiency anemia:**  Ferric citrate's ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron (the absorbable form) in the gut. This ferrous iron is then absorbed into the bloodstream, where it binds to transferrin, a protein that transports iron throughout the body. The iron is then utilized to produce hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Ferric citrate is contraindicated in patients with iron overload syndromes such as hemochromatosis.

* **Drug Interactions:** Ferric citrate can interact with numerous medications, including some antibiotics (quinolones, tetracyclines), bisphosphonates, levodopa, and others.  It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** While iron is essential during pregnancy, ferric citrate use should be carefully considered and monitored by a healthcare professional, as iron overload can pose risks to both the mother and the fetus.  Iron is excreted in breast milk; a healthcare professional should weigh the benefits and risks of using the medication while breastfeeding.

* **Other Precautions:**  Take ferric citrate with meals to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.  Do not crush or chew tablets to avoid discoloration of teeth and mouth.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I take ferric citrate with other medications?**  A:  It's vital to discuss all your medications with your doctor or pharmacist to avoid potential interactions.  

* **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose.  Don't double the dose.

* **Q: How should I store ferric citrate?** A: Store at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. Keep out of reach of children.

* **Q: What should I do if I suspect an overdose?** A: Contact a poison control center or seek immediate medical attention.

* **Q: Will ferric citrate darken my stools?** A: Yes, darkening of the stools is a common and generally harmless side effect.

* **Q: Is ferric citrate safe for long-term use?** A: Long-term use should be under close medical supervision to monitor for any adverse effects, particularly iron overload.  Regular blood tests are essential.
