# Flucloxacillin Sodium
### Generic Name
Flucloxacillin Sodium

### Usage

Flucloxacillin sodium is a penicillin-type antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections.  Its primary use is in combating infections caused by bacteria susceptible to penicillinase (an enzyme produced by some bacteria that deactivates penicillin).  This makes it particularly effective against staphylococcal infections, including those resistant to other penicillins.  These infections can affect various parts of the body, such as skin and soft tissues (abscesses, cellulitis), bones and joints (osteomyelitis), and lungs (pneumonia, although less common).  It's also sometimes used to prevent infection after certain surgical procedures.  Flucloxacillin is generally not effective against infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria or many anaerobic bacteria.  A doctor will determine if it's the right antibiotic based on the specific infection and bacterial sensitivity testing.


### Dosage

Dosage of flucloxacillin sodium varies depending on the severity of the infection, the patient's age and weight, and the method of administration (oral or intravenous).  Always follow your doctor's or pharmacist's instructions precisely.

**Oral Administration (Capsules, Tablets, or Suspension):**  Dosage is typically determined by body weight and the specific infection, usually ranging from 125mg to 500mg every six hours.  Children's dosages are calculated based on their weight and are usually significantly lower than adult doses.  The oral forms are not suitable for severe infections.

**Intravenous Administration:**  IV administration is reserved for severe infections or when oral administration is not possible. Dosage is typically higher than oral doses and is calculated based on body weight and the severity of the infection.  The infusion rate is also important and must be followed precisely as directed by the healthcare professional.  Infusion rates and total daily doses will vary depending on the severity and type of infection. This should only be administered in a medical setting by trained professionals.


### Side Effects

Flucloxacillin, like other antibiotics, can cause side effects.  While most are mild, some can be serious.  Itâ€™s crucial to contact a doctor immediately if any severe side effects occur.

* **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion, and rash.
* **Less Common but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue), jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), liver inflammation (hepatitis), kidney problems, and blood disorders.  A serious side effect, though rare, is pseudomembranous colitis (a severe bowel infection caused by *Clostridium difficile*).
* **Note:** This is not an exhaustive list.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any side effects, particularly if they are severe or persistent.


### How it Works

Flucloxacillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Bacteria need a strong cell wall to survive.  Flucloxacillin interferes with the building blocks of this wall, preventing the bacteria from forming a protective structure.  This leads to bacterial cell death, thereby controlling the infection.  Its resistance to penicillinase (beta-lactamase) is a key feature, enabling it to work against many staphylococcal strains resistant to other penicillins.


### Precautions

* **Allergies:**  Individuals with a known allergy to penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics should not take flucloxacillin.  Inform your doctor of any allergies before starting treatment.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Flucloxacillin can interact with certain medications, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners) and methotrexate.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist about all medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Flucloxacillin can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Consult your doctor for personalized advice.
* **Liver and Kidney Function:**  Patients with impaired liver or kidney function may require dosage adjustments.  Your doctor will assess your kidney and liver function to determine the appropriate dosage.
* **Oral Contraceptives:** Some evidence suggests that flucloxacillin may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Consider using alternative contraceptive methods while taking this medication.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I drink alcohol while taking flucloxacillin?**  A:  It's generally advised to avoid alcohol while taking antibiotics, as alcohol can interfere with the medication's effectiveness and potentially increase the risk of side effects.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist for personalized advice.

* **Q: How long should I take flucloxacillin?** A:  The duration of treatment depends on the type and severity of the infection.  Always complete the prescribed course of treatment, even if you start feeling better, to prevent recurrence.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A:  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.

* **Q: How should I store flucloxacillin?** A: Store flucloxacillin at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.  Discard any unused medication after the expiry date.

* **Q:  What should I do if I experience a severe allergic reaction?** A:  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, or hives. This is a medical emergency.
