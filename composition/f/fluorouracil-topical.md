# Fluorouracil (Topical)
### Generic Name
Fluorouracil (Topical)

### Usage
Fluorouracil topical is primarily used to treat multiple actinic keratoses (sun-damaged skin patches) and superficial basal cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer).  It's also sometimes used off-label for other conditions like Bowen's disease (a type of squamous cell carcinoma) and in situ penile carcinoma, but these uses aren't officially approved by regulatory agencies in all regions.  The topical application targets the affected skin areas, minimizing systemic effects.

### Dosage
Dosage varies greatly depending on the specific condition being treated and the formulation strength (concentration) of the fluorouracil cream or solution.  Always follow your doctor's instructions carefully.  Here are some examples based on common uses, but this is not exhaustive and should not replace your doctor's prescription:

* **Actinic Keratosis:**  Treatment may involve applying a thin film of 0.5% to 5% cream or solution once or twice daily for 2 to 6 weeks.  The exact strength, frequency, and duration will depend on your doctor's assessment of the condition's severity.

* **Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma:**  Usually, a 5% cream or solution is applied twice daily for 3 to 6 weeks.  In some cases, treatment may continue for up to 10 to 12 weeks.

* **Off-label uses (Bowen's disease, in situ penile carcinoma):**  Dosage and duration varies significantly depending on location, severity, and physician preference. It's crucial to follow your doctor's exact instructions for these off-label uses.

**Pediatric Use:**  The safety and effectiveness of topical fluorouracil in children have not been established.


### Side Effects
Common side effects of topical fluorouracil are usually limited to the application site and include:

* Scaling
* Dryness
* Burning
* Stinging
* Erythema (redness)
* Itching
* Pain
* Swelling
* Skin erosion


Less common but more serious side effects can include:

* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Severe skin reactions
* Eye irritation (conjunctivitis, corneal damage)
* Photosensitivity (increased sun sensitivity)

If you experience any unusual or severe side effects, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Fluorouracil is an antimetabolite, meaning it interferes with the process of cell growth and division. Specifically, it blocks the creation of thymidylic acid, a crucial component of DNA.  By disrupting DNA synthesis, it primarily affects rapidly dividing cells, like those in cancerous or precancerous skin lesions, leading to their destruction.  The topical application ensures that the medication primarily acts at the site of application, minimizing systemic side effects.


### Precautions
* **Contraindications:**  Do not use topical fluorouracil if you are allergic to fluorouracil or any of its components, have a deficiency in the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), or are pregnant or may become pregnant.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Fluorouracil's effects may be increased by the drug brivudine.  Inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Topical fluorouracil is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus. It's unclear whether it's excreted in breast milk, so discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before breastfeeding while using this medication.
* **Photosensitivity:** Topical fluorouracil can increase your skin's sensitivity to sunlight and UV radiation.  Avoid prolonged sun exposure and use sunscreen with a high SPF during treatment.
* **Application:**  Apply the medication as directed by your doctor, typically to clean, dry skin. Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and open wounds.  Wash your hands thoroughly after application.

### FAQs

* **Q: Can I use other skin products while using fluorouracil?** A: Discuss this with your doctor. Using other topical medications concurrently may affect results or increase irritation.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply the medication as soon as you remember unless it is almost time for your next dose.  Do not double the dose.
