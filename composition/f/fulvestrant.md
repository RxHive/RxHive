# Fulvestrant

**Generic Name:** Fulvestrant

**Usage:** Fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of:

* **Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer** in postmenopausal women with disease progression following endocrine therapy.  This includes those who have received prior tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors.
* **Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer** in postmenopausal women as a first-line endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib.

**Side Effects:**  The most common side effects of fulvestrant include:

* **Injection site reactions:** Pain, redness, swelling, bruising, or itching at the injection site.
* **Fatigue:** Feeling tired or weak.
* **Hot flashes:** Sudden sensations of heat.
* **Nausea:** Feeling sick to your stomach.
* **Arthralgia (joint pain):** Pain in the joints.
* **Back pain:** Pain in the back.
* **Increased blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides):**  Elevated levels of fats in the blood.
* **Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count):** A decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, which can increase bleeding risk.
* **Elevation of liver enzymes:**  Indicators of possible liver damage.

Serious side effects, while less common, can include allergic reactions and serious cardiovascular events.  It's crucial to report any unusual or concerning side effects to your doctor immediately.  The frequency and severity of side effects can vary between individuals.


**How it Works:** Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD).  Unlike other anti-estrogens that block estrogen from binding to the estrogen receptor (ER), fulvestrant directly degrades the ER, reducing the amount of ER available in breast cancer cells.  By lowering the levels of ER, it inhibits the growth and spread of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells that depend on estrogen for survival.
