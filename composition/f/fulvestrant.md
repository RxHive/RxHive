# Fulvestrant
### Generic Name
Fulvestrant

### Usage

Fulvestrant is a medication used to treat certain types of breast cancer.  It's specifically indicated for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer in postmenopausal women.  This means it's effective against breast cancers that are fueled by the hormone estrogen and don't overexpress the HER2 protein.  Fulvestrant is used either as a single therapy (monotherapy) or in combination with other medications, such as palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib, depending on the stage and progression of the cancer.  Its primary use is in treating advanced or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body) breast cancer.  It may also be used in earlier stages of the disease in certain clinical scenarios under the guidance of an oncologist.


### Dosage

Fulvestrant is administered as an intramuscular injection (IM).  The dosage and schedule vary depending on the specific treatment approach:

* **Monotherapy:** The typical starting dose is 500 mg given on days 1, 15, and 29, followed by a 500 mg injection once monthly.

* **Combination Therapy:** When used with palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib, the initial dose is usually 500 mg on days 1, 15, and 29, followed by a 500 mg injection every 28 days.  The combination therapy continues until the cancer progresses or intolerable side effects arise.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  The dosage may need to be adjusted in patients with moderate liver impairment.  Renal impairment generally doesn't require dose modification.  Children and pre-menopausal women require specific considerations and may need additional medications in conjunction with Fulvestrant.  Precise dosing should always be determined and monitored by a healthcare professional.

### Side Effects

Common side effects (occurring in more than 10% of patients) can include:

* Fatigue
* Headache
* Hot flashes
* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Injection site pain
* Increased levels of liver enzymes

Less common but potentially serious side effects include:

* Hepatic failure
* Hepatitis
* Vaginal bleeding
* Blood clots (venous thromboembolism)
* Allergic reactions


If you experience any concerning side effects, contact your doctor immediately.


### How it Works

Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD).  It works by binding to estrogen receptors within breast cancer cells, preventing estrogen from binding and essentially blocking its growth-promoting effects.  Unlike some other hormone therapies that only block estrogen's action, Fulvestrant actually causes a reduction in the number of estrogen receptors, leading to a more pronounced anti-tumor effect.


### Precautions

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Fulvestrant is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential harm to the fetus and infant.  Effective contraception is crucial before, during, and for a year after treatment.

* **Liver Function:** Fulvestrant is primarily metabolized by the liver.  Patients with liver disease may require dose adjustments or close monitoring.

* **Allergic Reactions:** Allergic reactions, including severe ones, are possible.  Discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical attention if an allergic reaction occurs.

* **Bleeding:** Fulvestrant may increase the risk of bleeding. Patients with bleeding disorders should be carefully monitored.

* **Drug Interactions:** Fulvestrant may interact with other medications; inform your doctor of all medications you are taking.
