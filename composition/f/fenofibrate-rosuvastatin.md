# Fenofibrate + Rosuvastatin

**Generic Name:** Fenofibrate/Rosuvastatin

**Usage:** This combination medication is used to lower cholesterol and triglycerides (types of fat) in the blood.  It's typically prescribed for people with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels who haven't reached their cholesterol goals with rosuvastatin alone.  The specific dosage and duration of treatment will be determined by a doctor based on individual needs and response.  This is often prescribed for patients with high risk of cardiovascular disease.

**Side Effects:**  Side effects can vary in frequency and severity. Common side effects include:

* **Muscle pain (myalgia) or weakness (myopathy):** This is a serious concern, particularly with statins like rosuvastatin.  Report any muscle pain, weakness, tenderness, or unexplained muscle aches immediately to your doctor.  Rarely, this can lead to rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown).
* **Gastrointestinal issues:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.
* **Liver problems:**  Elevated liver enzymes.  Regular liver function tests are usually monitored.
* **Gallstones:** Fenofibrate increases the risk of gallstones.
* **Headache:**
* **Dizziness:**
* **Fatigue:**
* **Rash:**


**Less common but more serious side effects:**

* **Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas):**  Severe abdominal pain requiring immediate medical attention.
* **Kidney problems:**


**How it Works:**

* **Rosuvastatin (a statin):**  Works by blocking an enzyme the liver needs to produce cholesterol. This leads to lower levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
* **Fenofibrate (a fibrate):**  Works by increasing the breakdown of triglycerides and improving the levels of "good" HDL cholesterol. It also reduces the production of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).

The combination of these two medications provides a more comprehensive approach to lowering cholesterol and triglycerides than either drug alone.
