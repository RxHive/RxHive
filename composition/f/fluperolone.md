# Fluperolone
### Generic Name
Fluperolone Acetate

### Usage

Fluperolone acetate is a corticosteroid used topically to treat various inflammatory skin conditions.  Its primary use is to reduce inflammation and itching associated with dermatoses such as eczema (atopic dermatitis), psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin diseases.  While it's not typically the first-line treatment for severe conditions, it can be effective in managing mild to moderate symptoms.  It's crucial to understand that fluperolone acetate only treats the symptoms; it doesn't cure the underlying skin condition.


### Dosage

Dosage depends on the specific condition being treated, the severity of symptoms, and the area affected.  A healthcare professional should always determine the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.  Generally, a thin film of fluperolone acetate cream or ointment is applied to the affected area one to three times daily.  The frequency and duration of application will vary based on individual response and the physician's recommendation.  Specific instructions will be provided on the prescription label.  Use in children requires careful monitoring by a pediatrician, as the dosage may differ based on age and body surface area.  Fluperolone acetate is not typically used for extensive areas of the body or for long periods due to the risk of systemic absorption and potential side effects.


### Side Effects

Common side effects, particularly with prolonged use or application to large areas, may include:

* Skin thinning (atrophy)
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Telangiectasia (small, dilated blood vessels)
* Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
* Itching
* Dryness
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)


Less common, but more serious, side effects include:

* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Skin infections (secondary to impaired skin barrier function)
* Increased intraocular pressure (with prolonged use around the eyes)


If you experience any side effects, particularly those that are severe or persistent, contact your healthcare provider immediately.


### How it Works

Fluperolone acetate is a synthetic corticosteroid.  It works by binding to specific receptors within the cells of the skin. This binding process reduces the release of inflammatory substances, thus decreasing swelling, redness, itching, and other symptoms associated with inflammatory skin conditions.  Essentially, it modulates the immune response in the affected area, reducing the inflammatory process.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:**  Fluperolone acetate is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to corticosteroids or any components of the formulation. It should be avoided in patients with viral, fungal, or bacterial skin infections.
* **Drug Interactions:**  There are no known significant drug interactions with topical fluperolone acetate. However, it's essential to inform your healthcare provider about all medications, including over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements, you are taking.
* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** The safety of fluperolone acetate during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. Consult your doctor before using this medication if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.
* **Children:** Use in children should be under the close supervision of a pediatrician due to the potential for increased systemic absorption and side effects.
* **Elderly:**  The elderly may be more susceptible to skin thinning and other side effects.  Careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Avoid application to the face, groin, or axillae:**  These areas are particularly sensitive and prone to side effects.
* **Do not use on broken skin:**  This can increase absorption and risk of side effects.
