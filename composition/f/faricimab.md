# Faricimab
### Generic Name
Faricimab

### Usage
Faricimab is a medicine used to treat two eye conditions: neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME).  Both conditions involve abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This abnormal growth can lead to vision loss.  Faricimab's primary use is to slow or stop this abnormal blood vessel growth and thus prevent further vision loss.

### Dosage
Faricimab is administered as an injection into the eye (intravitreal injection).  Dosage and frequency vary depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response.

**For neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD):**

*   **Initial Phase:**  6 mg (0.05 mL of a 120 mg/mL solution) is injected once every 4 weeks for the first four doses.
*   **Maintenance Phase:** After the initial four doses, the dosing schedule is adjusted based on individual responses, ranging from every 8, 12, or 16 weeks.  Some patients may need more frequent injections (every 4 weeks) depending on their individual needs and assessment by their ophthalmologist.  Regular monitoring is crucial.

**For diabetic macular edema (DME):**

There are two recommended regimens:

*   **Regimen 1:** 6 mg every 4 weeks for at least 4 doses.  The interval between doses can then be adjusted based on the thickness of the macula (measured by optical coherence tomography) and visual acuity.  The interval can be increased by up to 4 weeks or decreased by up to 8 weeks, depending on individual response.
*   **Regimen 2:** 6 mg every 4 weeks for the first 6 doses, then every 8 weeks for the following 28 weeks.  However, some patients might still require monthly injections (every 4 weeks) based on their individual response. Regular monitoring is essential.

**Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Faricimab in children haven't been established.

**Dosage Adjustments:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment. However, patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) should be carefully monitored.

### Side Effects

**Common Side Effects (Occurring in 1-10% of patients):**

*   Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding in the conjunctiva – the white part of the eye)
*   Eye discomfort, irritation, or pain
*   Increased intraocular pressure (pressure inside the eye)
*   Intraocular inflammation (inflammation inside the eye)
*   Vitreous hemorrhage (bleeding in the vitreous humor – the gel-like substance filling the eye)
*   Arterial thromboembolism (blood clot in an artery)
*   Development of antibodies against Faricimab

**Less Common, but Serious Side Effects (Occurring in less than 1% of patients):**

*   Endophthalmitis (serious eye infection)
*   Retinal detachment (separation of the retina from the underlying tissue)
*   Retinal hole without detachment
*   Blurred vision
*   Decreased visual acuity (temporary)
*   Corneal abrasion (scratch on the cornea – the clear front part of the eye)


If you experience any side effects, especially those listed above or any unexpected changes in your vision, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

### How it Works
Faricimab is a bispecific antibody. This means it targets two proteins involved in the abnormal blood vessel growth in nAMD and DME: vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2).  By binding to these proteins, Faricimab blocks their activity.  This helps to reduce the growth of abnormal blood vessels, decrease swelling, and ultimately protect vision.  While the mechanism of action relating to Ang-2 inhibition is still being studied, the overall effect is a reduction in abnormal blood vessel growth and associated damage.

### Precautions

*   **Hypersensitivity:** Faricimab is contraindicated (should not be used) in patients with known hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) to Faricimab or its components.
*   **Ocular Infections:**  Avoid using Faricimab if you have an active eye or surrounding tissue infection.
*   **Intraocular Inflammation:**  Faricimab should not be used if you have active inflammation within the eye.
*   **Increased Risk:**  Patients using Faricimab may have an increased risk of retinal vasculitis/retinal vascular occlusion, thromboembolic events, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and increased intraocular pressure.
*   **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**  Faricimab may cause harm to a developing fetus.  Effective contraception is recommended for women of childbearing age before, during, and for at least three months after treatment.  It is unknown whether Faricimab is excreted in breast milk; the decision to breastfeed should be made cautiously, considering the risks and benefits.


### FAQs

*   **Q: How is Faricimab administered?**  A:  It's injected directly into the eye (intravitreal injection) by a qualified ophthalmologist.

*   **Q: How long does treatment last?** A: The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition and the patient's response; regular monitoring is crucial.

*   **Q: How should I store Faricimab?** A:  Follow the storage instructions provided with your medication.

*   **Q: What if I miss a dose?** A: Contact your ophthalmologist immediately to reschedule your injection.

*   **Q: Are there any interactions with other medications?** A: Currently, no significant drug interactions are known, but you should always inform your ophthalmologist about all medications you are taking.

*   **Q: Can Faricimab cure nAMD or DME?** A: Faricimab does not cure these conditions, but it can help to slow or stop the progression of vision loss.
