# Fluocinonide
### Generic Name
Fluocinonide

### Usage

Fluocinonide is a topical corticosteroid used to relieve inflammation and itching caused by various skin conditions.  Its primary use is in treating corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (skin diseases that respond to corticosteroids) in individuals aged 12 years and older.  These conditions include, but are not limited to, eczema (atopic dermatitis), psoriasis, and other inflammatory skin disorders.  While it's effective for several conditions, it's crucial to remember that fluocinonide isn't suitable for all skin problems.  Its use should always be under the guidance of a healthcare professional who can determine the appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.

### Dosage

Dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the concentration of the fluocinonide preparation (0.05% or 0.1%), and the area of skin affected.  It's always applied topically (directly to the skin).

* **Adults:**  For most corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses (excluding psoriasis and atopic dermatitis), a thin layer of 0.05% fluocinonide cream, gel, ointment, or solution is applied to the affected area 2-4 times daily.  The 0.1% cream is applied 1-2 times daily. For psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, the application frequency and concentration are similar.  The maximum recommended weekly dose is 60 grams.  Treatment should stop once the condition is under control; prolonged use beyond two weeks isn't generally recommended. Avoid applying to the face, groin, armpits, or areas prone to perioral dermatitis (rash around the mouth) or rosacea.

* **Children (12 years and older):**  The dosage for children 12 years and older is the same as for adults. Fluocinonide is not typically recommended for children under 12 years old unless specifically prescribed by a physician who will carefully weigh the benefits against the risks.

* **Administration:**  Always apply a thin layer, rubbing it gently into the affected area. Avoid contact with eyes. Wash hands thoroughly after application unless the hands are being treated. Occlusive dressings (bandages that prevent air from reaching the skin) can increase absorption and might be used under the supervision of a doctor for severe cases of psoriasis or other recalcitrant conditions.


### Side Effects

Common side effects can include:

* Burning or irritation at the application site
* Skin thinning (atrophy)
* Stretch marks (striae)
* Acne
* Increased hair growth (hypertrichosis)
* Changes in skin pigmentation (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation)
* Allergic contact dermatitis

Less common, but more serious, side effects are possible, especially with prolonged or widespread use or use of high-potency formulations:

* Adrenal suppression (the body's natural production of cortisol is reduced)
* Growth retardation in children
* Cushing's syndrome (a hormonal disorder)
* Increased blood sugar (hyperglycemia)


If any of these side effects occur, or if you notice any other unusual symptoms, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

### How it Works

Fluocinonide is a potent corticosteroid that works by reducing inflammation and itching. It acts by binding to specific receptors within the skin cells, which reduces the release of inflammatory substances (like prostaglandins and leukotrienes) responsible for swelling, redness, and itching.  This anti-inflammatory action helps to improve the symptoms of various skin conditions.

### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Fluocinonide is contraindicated (should not be used) in individuals with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to fluocinonide or any of the formulation's components.

* **Drug Interactions:** Although relatively few,  interactions with other medications are possible. Discuss all medications and supplements with your doctor or pharmacist before using fluocinonide.  For example, corticosteroids may reduce the effectiveness of aldesleukin, a cancer treatment medication.

* **Specific Populations:**
    * **Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women:** Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be approached cautiously under the direct supervision of a doctor, as the effects on the developing fetus and the infant are unknown.  Topical corticosteroids are generally preferred over systemic ones during pregnancy for conditions like psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, but high-potency ones should be avoided in the first trimester.  Avoid applying to the nipples if breastfeeding.
    * **Children:** Fluocinonide is generally not recommended for use in children under 12, except under the close supervision of a healthcare provider.
    * **Elderly:**  The elderly may be more susceptible to side effects, requiring careful monitoring.

* **Warnings:**  Prolonged or extensive use of fluocinonide can lead to adrenal suppression, skin thinning, and other systemic side effects.  It's crucial to use only as directed and for the prescribed duration. Monitor for signs of infection, such as increased redness, pus, or worsening symptoms.


### FAQs

* **Q: How long does it take to see results?** A: The time it takes to see improvement varies depending on the individual and the severity of the condition.  Some individuals may notice a difference within days, while others may take several weeks.

* **Q: Can I use fluocinonide on my face?** A:  Generally, lower concentration (0.05%) formulations can be used cautiously on the face, but higher concentrations (0.1%) should be avoided, as it can lead to skin thinning and other side effects. Always follow your doctor's instructions.

* **Q: Can I use fluocinonide with other skin creams or lotions?** A: Discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist.  Using multiple topical medications simultaneously could potentially lead to interactions or increased side effects.

* **Q: How should I store fluocinonide?** A: Store it at room temperature, away from direct sunlight and moisture.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Apply it as soon as you remember, but do not double up on doses.  Follow your prescribed treatment schedule.
