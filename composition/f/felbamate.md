# Felbamate
### Generic Name
Felbamate

### Usage
Felbamate is an anticonvulsant medication primarily used to treat partial seizures (both with and without generalization) in adults and adolescents aged 14 years and older.  It's employed either as a monotherapy (the sole medication) or as adjunctive therapy (alongside other anticonvulsants).  A notable secondary use is as adjunctive therapy for partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children aged 2 to 14 years.  It's crucial to understand that Felbamate is reserved for situations where other treatments have proven inadequate and the potential risks are deemed acceptable given the severity of the patient's condition.  It's not considered a first-line treatment for epilepsy.

### Dosage

**Adults (≥14 years):**

* **Partial Seizures (Monotherapy):**  The initial oral dose is 1200 mg/day, divided into 3-4 doses.  This is carefully titrated upwards (increased in increments of 600 mg every 2 weeks) to a maximum of 3600 mg/day based on individual response.  Titration should be cautious, especially in patients who haven't received anticonvulsant treatment before.  
* **Partial Seizures (Conversion to Monotherapy):**  Begin with 1200 mg/day (3-4 divided doses).  Simultaneously, reduce the dose of other anticonvulsants by 33%.  At week 2, increase Felbamate to 2400 mg/day and further reduce other medications by another 33%. At week 3, increase Felbamate to 3600 mg/day and continue adjusting other medications as needed.
* **Partial Seizures (Adjunctive Therapy):** Start with 1200 mg/day (3-4 divided doses). Increase the dose by 1200 mg/day weekly, up to a maximum of 3600 mg/day.  Reduce the dosage of other anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid) by 20% initially, with further reductions potentially necessary as Felbamate dosage increases.

**Children and Adolescents (2-14 years):**

* **Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (Adjunctive Therapy):** The initial oral dose is 15 mg/kg/day, divided into 3-4 doses.  The dose is then titrated upward in 15 mg/kg/day increments weekly, up to a maximum of 45 mg/kg/day or 3600 mg/day (whichever is lower). Dosage adjustments for other anticonvulsants are the same as described for adults receiving adjunctive therapy.  Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children under 2 years of age.

**Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Hepatic Impairment:** Felbamate is contraindicated in patients with a history of liver dysfunction.
* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; reduce initial and maintenance doses by 50%.  Further dose reductions may be necessary if using Felbamate with other drugs that affect its plasma concentration, particularly other anti-epileptic drugs.


**Administration:** The oral form of Felbamate can be taken with or without food.  Liquid suspensions should be shaken well before use.

### How it Works

Felbamate's exact mechanism of action isn't fully understood. It exhibits weak inhibitory effects on GABA and benzodiazepine receptor binding but lacks activity at the NMDA receptor site.


### Precautions

* **Contraindications:** Felbamate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Felbamate, carbamates, or any formulation component; those with a history of blood dyscrasias (blood disorders) or hepatic dysfunction (liver problems).

* **Warnings:**  Felbamate carries a significant risk of aplastic anemia and hepatic failure.  These are serious and potentially fatal side effects.  Close monitoring is crucial, particularly complete blood counts (CBCs) and liver function tests.  The medication should only be used when the benefits outweigh these substantial risks and after consultation with hematology and hepatology experts.  Suicidal thoughts or behavior are also possible side effects; careful monitoring for these is essential.

* **Drug Interactions:** Felbamate interacts with other anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, phenobarbital), potentially altering their plasma concentrations.  Dose adjustments may be necessary to maintain therapeutic levels and prevent adverse effects.

* **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:** Felbamate is categorized as pregnancy Category C, meaning its risks to the fetus aren't fully known.  It's also excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding isn't recommended during Felbamate treatment.

* **Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and reduce dosage in patients with kidney problems.

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption during treatment as it can increase CNS (central nervous system) depressant effects.


### FAQs

* **Q: Can I stop taking Felbamate suddenly?** A: No, abruptly stopping Felbamate can increase seizure frequency.  Always follow your doctor's instructions for gradually tapering off the medication.

* **Q: How should I store Felbamate?** A: Store Felbamate as directed on the label, usually at room temperature, away from moisture and light.

* **Q: What should I do if I miss a dose?** A: Take the missed dose as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose.  Don't double up on doses.

* **Q: Are there any specific dietary restrictions while taking Felbamate?** A: There are no specific dietary restrictions, but maintaining a healthy diet is generally advisable.

* **Q: What should I do if I experience side effects?** A: Report any side effects, especially serious ones, to your doctor immediately.

* **Q:  Is Felbamate addictive?** A: Felbamate is not considered an addictive substance in the same way as opioids or other controlled substances. However,  sudden discontinuation can lead to increased seizure activity, highlighting the importance of following your doctor’s instructions regarding dosage and discontinuation.
